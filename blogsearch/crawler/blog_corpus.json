    "content": "As we in the IndieWeb promote personal websites and encourage more people to write and publish online, and nostalgia for blogs and RSS is high, it\u2019s useful to hone in on what exactly we\u2019re talking about when we say blog.* Because, despite being a form of writing for more than 20 years, blogging is surprisingly hard to pin down.**\nThere are just a few truly defining characteristics of a blog:\nAnd yet, I think what makes a blog a blog is more than these technicalities; what makes a book a book is not merely \u201cprose text, more than 50,000 words in length, on a single thesis or theme, collected in a single volume.\u201d Printing off a long blog and binding it together does not necessarily a book make; for one, books are weighted towards linear reading \u2014 start to finish \u2014 while blog posts do not have to be read in the order they were originally published.\nThere are elements of bookness that make us say, this is a book. So what is blogness? From one of the many \u2018yay let\u2019s blog again\u2019 posts everyone\u2019s blogging about right now (which I enjoy), I wound up on a 2003 post trying to define what a blog is \u2014 but it addresses mainly the technical elements and the structure of the content. Blogging as a medium evolved out of the combination of technology and tools used; here, I\u2019m interested in digging into how the writing and format are different from other mediums.\nI\u2019m a fan of graphic novels, and consider them a different medium than prose books; it pisses me off that graphic novels and graphic non-fiction are shelved with the comic strips at my library under 741.5. So I wonder: are blogs a distinct enough format to be their own top-level medium, or are they simply a hypertextual version of essay collections or newspapers?*** Where would you shelve blogs in the library: do they get mixed in with the books by topic, do they get their own call number as graphic novels do, are they thrown in with the periodicals, or do they go in their own section? @DavidShanske I\u2019m sure you have an opini"

    "content": "In 1998 there were just a handful of sites of the type that are now identified as weblogs (so named by Jorn Barger in December 1997). Jesse James Garrett, editor of Infosift, began compiling a list of \"other sites like his\" as he found them in his travels around the web. In November of that year, he sent that list to Cameron Barrett. Cameron published the list on Camworld, and others maintaining similar sites began sending their URLs to him for inclusion on the list. Jesse's 'page of only weblogs' lists the 23 known to be in existence at the beginning of 1999.\nSuddenly a community sprang up. It was easy to read all of the weblogs on Cameron's list, and most interested people did. Peter Merholz announced in early 1999 that he was going to pronounce it 'wee-blog' and inevitably this was shortened to 'blog' with the weblog editor referred to as a 'blogger.'\nAt this point, the bandwagon jumping began. More and more people began publishing their own weblogs. I began mine in April of 1999. Suddenly it became difficult to read every weblog every day, or even to keep track of all the new ones that were appearing. Cameron's list grew so large that he began including only weblogs he actually followed himself. Other webloggers did the same. In early 1999 Brigitte Eaton compiled a list of every weblog she knew about and created the Eatonweb Portal. Brig evaluated all submissions by a simple criterion: that the site consist of dated entries. Webloggers debated what was and what was not a weblog, but since the Eatonweb Portal was the most complete listing of weblogs available, Brig's inclusive definition prevailed.\nThis rapid growth continued steadily until July 1999 when Pitas, the first free build-your-own-weblog tool launched, and suddenly there were hundreds.  In August, Pyra  released Blogger, and Groksoup launched, and with the ease that these web-based tools provided, the bandwagon-jumping turned into an explosion.

    "content": "People are scrambling for alternatives with the downfall of Twitter. The service pioneered the concept of brief, concise posts which every other social network soon copied. In a world of short attention spans and instant gratification, the format seemed all but inevitable.\nOut of this spawned a new type of writing, dubbed microblogging. Like Twitter, they consist of short posts without titles, or much metadata at all beyond a date. There are a few indie services offering these, or in a pinch you can turn a blog like WordPress into one.\nBut the phrase microblog implies the existence of a macroblog, and that\u2019s what I miss the most. Back when people used to write more than a sentence or two about their day, the flowers they saw, the problems the solved, the people they talked with, the places they travelled.\nThis is why I\u2019ve started writing more about my travels and life of late, because its what I miss seeing from other people. It used to be that you could subscribe to your friends\u2019 blogs and see what they were up to. Now we only get fragments on a social network that will end up deleting them.\nMicroblogs have their place, but they make me a bit melancholic. It\u2019s time to bring back the macroblog!\nI'm Ruben Schade, a technical writer and IaaS engineer in Australia. Hi! You can shout me a coffee or send a comment here.

    "content": "Written by Jay on August 14, 2017.\nBy 2001, the world\u00a0blog\u00a0had entered Internet vernacular, both as a noun and a verb. Mena Trott was one of these bloggers. Her site,\u00a0A Dollar Short, went up in April of 2001. With the launch of her site, Trott aimed big. She loved blogging, and she aspired to be one of the best. So she set her sights on winning the SXSW weblog award and, at the end of 2002, she did just that. Which, incidentally, was right around the time that she was changing the blogging world forever.\nJust a few years before that, things were a lot different. The term\u00a0blog\u00a0can be traced back to around 1997, when Jorn Barger launched his website, titling it \u201cThe Robot Wisdom Weblog.\u201d Barger\u2019s plan was to curate his favorite links from around the web, and add bits of commentary to each one. In other words, he meant to keep a\u00a0log of his\u00a0web\u00a0experience. Hence weblog.\nPretty soon other weblogs started sprouting up. In their earliest days, webloggers stood as gatekeepers to the web\u2019s ever-growing well of content. Each day, these URL pioneers would post a few new links and sprinkle in their own commentary. Blogs acted as a signpost for web users, and following a few key blogs was enough to keep track of just about everything new on the web. Many began to look at the blogging community as a brand new type of media, one that often stood far closer to an impartial truth than traditional mediums would allow for. It wasn\u2019t long until there were even weblog sites focused on helping its visitors keep track of\u00a0other\u00a0weblog\u2019s, such as Brigitte Eaton\u2019s EatonWeb Portal.\nThen, in 1999, Peter Merholz threw up his own weblog, and in the sidebar added the tagline:\nI\u2019ve decided to pronounce the word \u201cweblog\u201d as wee\u2019- blog. Or \u201cblog\u201d for short.\nAnd from what was more or less a throwaway joke, we got the word blog.\nIn the beginning, most bloggers hand coded their sites, adding a new HTML page to their server each time they had a new entry, or just updating the homepage to include the new"

A creative way of recyling material by making little changes, so that it magically fits in new pieces.\nIt reminded me of a text I have used and re-used on multiple ocassions, most recently in this piece in the context of the June 2025-edition of the IndieWeb Carnival. The original piece, which I wrote back in 2018, features a life-changing question a friend asked me on a trip to Nice, France, which eventually led to my current career as a computer science- and software development teacher.\nSince publishing the original I have used the basis of this text as the underlying written story for multiple job application cover letters: three times for a position at a secondary school and once at an applied university.\nI got accepted in the position every time.\nReusing a piece of content multiple times after creating it once is nothing new. Live performers like actors or singers do it all the time: a theatrical piece is written once and performed dozens, even hundreds of times. A band plays the same setlist in concerts halls all over the world.\nIt's just the concept of textual content like blog posts, for which this feels a little more weird and unusual.

I\u2019ll start with a short tale about the inception of shellsharks and the unsuccessful blogging attempts which preceded it.Historical ContextI started the shellsharks site in mid-2019. At that time, I had but two ideas for topics to write about - a \u201cGetting Into Infosec\u201d guide and an idea to catalog all of the \u201cnamed\u201d vulnerabilities (e.g. \u201cHeartbleed\u201d). Prior to 2019, I tried at least two other times to blog or otherwise \u201cwrite\u201d, both of which fizzled out before I got to a second post. At the time, I blamed this on the usual reasons - not enough time, didn\u2019t know what to write about, couldn\u2019t find my \u201cniche\u201d, etc\u2026 What I failed to realize then are a number of things I fully appreciate today, and I\u2019d like to share those with you. Let me start with what not to worry about when starting a blog\u2026What Not To Worry AboutIn this section is a list of common concerns & fears people have when faced with the thought of starting a blog. Many of these slowed me down in the beginning but I am here to tell you, don\u2019t worry about it!I don\u2019t know how to host a blog : This is an easy fix and it is only a Google search away! You have plenty of options too, with varying degrees of complexity. Sites like Medium can make it easy to get started, WordPress is incredibly popular and has plenty of advanced functionality as well as for-beginners templates and tutorials, and GitHub Pages (which I personally use) can help you host a blog directly out of a GitHub account! There are countless other means too. The important takeaway is that it is easy to start, you need only contend with overchoice.I don\u2019t know which blog hosting provider is best : This is a classic road block. You know you want to start a blog but get bogged down in picking the best hosting provider or the best of whatever else. Don\u2019t sweat this too much. Do a little research and pick one that fit"

Or it broke. The upgrade from Ubuntu 17.10 to 18.04 didn\u2019t take.\nI managed to recover the old server long enough to log in and get the important\nstuff: the actual content. Then I thought: better start afresh. New server,\ninstalled from scratch, set up the blog app I\u2019d written, import the old content,\nand we\u2019re back in business.\nBut I didn\u2019t. To do it properly, I\u2019d need to write some kind of automated\nsetup script, either a bunch of shell scripts, something involving Docker\nor something like Ansible.\nWay too much effort for a personal blog.\nDevOps is one thing, but BlogOps? I refuse.\nEven if I were to do so, I would be in the same bind: in a year or two,\nI\u2019d have to upgrade it all again, and that would require time and effort.\nAlternatively, I could host it on Heroku, but to make that work properly, you\nhave to pay money. Or maybe on Google Cloud Platform, or Azure. More technology\nto learn. No thanks.\nInstead, I settled on using Hugo and\nNetlify. My friend Dan\nhad told me about Netlify recently\u2014I had heard of it, but hadn\u2019t really tried it.\nIt is basically Heroku but for static sites.

Frankly, I don\u2019t\nknow Go, but it looks reasonably straightforward to learn enough if I need to\nmeddle in the innards of the thing\u2014which I have no intention to unless necessary.\nI grabbed the nicest looking Hugo theme, and got it up on Netlify within about\n15 minutes.

[Starry skies above, and all that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMnLoOnrwbg).\nI had fun this past week [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/disquiet/status/1380354467887865859), resulting in a long thread on why blogs are great. I\u2019m repurposing much of it here, lightly edited, so it\u2019s in one place, true to my sense that Twitter is best as a public notebook.\nDon\u2019t sweat the digital undercarriage.

Just choose one for now and start a blog. You can always output your blog\u2019s content at a later date and upload it into a new service down the road. I\u2019ve seen plenty of people get so focused on tweaking their CMS (content management system) that they never actually get around to publishing.\nI\u2019ve written something along these lines before, which I collated in a post titled [\u201cBring Out Your Blogs\u201d](https://disquiet.com/2019/06/16/word-blog-20th-anniversary-1999/) back in 2019, which marked the 20th anniversary of the word \u201cblog.\u201d The main points are simple: \n1.
