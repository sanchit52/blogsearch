Given how superb and polished Gatsby is, and how simple Heroku makes hosting, I figured the time was right to just set up my own blog, and own my own content.\n\nExpect this blog to be a work in progress for some time. I'll spruce it up and make it my own as time permits, but in the meantime there's no shortage of content I'm eager to write. React Hooks are incredibly exciting, and I have some posts that have been in the back of my mind for awhile.\n\nStay tuned!"}

Really looking forward to them! Got more into those topics in the last couple month.\n\nRead both. Very good books.\n\n+1 for The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck.\n\nI'm currently reading the first two, but for the first time.\n\nA bit related -- I liked Sarah Knight's The Life Changing Magic Of Not Giving A Fuck.\n\nListening to\n\non Audible. It's pretty good; I'd recommend it.\n\nCan't go wrong with Orson Scott Card!! One of my fav sci-fi authors, I never tried audiobooks, I think this is going to be my first.\n\nThe Ender's series/branch/tree? is pretty vast, but I really enjoyed Ender's game, and Ender's Shadow.\n\nI really liked the one with the piggies. Whatever one that is.\n\nSpeaker for the dead, the sequel to Ender's game.\n\nI thought it was good also.\n\nGreat book! Love it!\n\nIt is one of the best read audiobooks that I've ever listened too. It comes off as practically being acted out.\n\nthe ultimate hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy\n\nClassic! :D\n\nyes, i heard a lot about it in those \"must read books\" blogs. thought i'll give it a try and it's really good\n\nI read this in 8th grade, but wouldn't mind reading it again.\n\nwow! in 8th grade i was trying to wrap my head around \"the road not taken\"\n\nNice one \ud83d\ude01 That's on my shelf too! But haven't read it yet :(\n\nplease do! the sarcasm and wit level is off the charts\n\nby Mike Massimino: The journey of an astronaut coming from a totally ordinary background. Very inspiring.\n\nby Tara Westover: Born to survivalists in the mountains, she lived off the grid for the first 17 years of her life. She then began to educate herself, learned enough math and grammar to get accepted by an university. She then travel the world and goes on an adventure that changes her life. I am just at the beginning of the book, but I just can't put the book down.\n\nI read Educated earlier this year and found the same thing.  Once I started it was impossible to put down.  The book has lots of simple details that add so much color to her world.\n\nEducated sounds like an interesting read. I'd check it out.\n\nI got it from Bill Gates yearly reading list. You're hardly wrong with that list. Enjoy!\n\nI'm reading \"Where the Crawdad Sings\" and \"The Power of Habit\" right now (I have one Audible and one paper book going at a time). I also keep a thread on twitter with stuff I've currently read with mini-reviews!\n\nI couldn't put \"Where the Crawdad Sings\" down!\n\nThe\n\nseries by Ada Palmer. A series of four books with two currently released. I'm reading the third right now and like it quite much. It's an interesting take on Scifi with new social structures and such and not too far in the future.\n\nI'm also reading\n\nby\n\nbecause I have to make a social media plan for a dev-rel position I want to start.\n\nI can't wait to hear what you think about it! I'm always happy to answer additional questions :)\n\nI just finished reading\n\nby Mary Robinette Kowal. It's a sci fi fiction of an alternate universe where a meteorite hits the Earth (Washington, DC specifically) and causes huge climate changes that will make the Earth inhabitable in a few years. The only solution? Colonizing space!\n\nThe book features a lot of well-written and brilliant female pilots, computers, physicists and astronauts.\n\nThis book is soooo good. I loved it.\n\nIt was great \ud83d\ude04 did you get a chance to read its sequel?\n\nNo, it sounded interesting, but I like the book so much stand alone, I don't want to know what happens next.\n\nBut it ended with such a cliffhanger! \ud83d\ude32\n\nAs far as I know the second book is out and the third one will be out in 2020. So I'll wait until then to read the two back-to-back.\n\nBeen in a bit of a crabby mood toward the \"traditional\" workplace lately, so I've circled back to three of my standbys:\n\nAnd since my doctor recently gave me a hard time about my carb'tastic eating habits and sedentary desk job, I'll probably pick up one more title for motivation:\n\nListening to\n\nby Richard Feynman\n\nand reading\n\nby Keith Edmunds\n\nI'm studying-up to be a D&D Dungeon Master for a new campaign I'm doing with my coworkers, and am reading through the\n\nand the\n\n.\n\nI've the Guide too!

So, as you can imagine, I read a\n\nof books, both with my mother and on my own. (I read through the complete unabridged Wizard of Oz series by myself in one summer when I was six.)\n\nI joined my first professional critique group when I was eight; I was told I'd be welcome to join, but they'd expect me to accept the same unvarnished feedback that any grown-up member would get, and to read their work and provide the same sort of honest feedback. So, I did.\n\nWhen writing professionally, you really learn that nothing you write is sacred. Even the sentence you think is the\n\nbrilliant, or the quote you think must surely be worthy of Bartlett's Quotations, might actually need to get cut from the book. Most people are okay coming up with words; the art of writing is largely in\n\nof words.\n\nFrom there, I just kept writing, participating in critique groups and countless writing workshops, and honing my craft.\n\nCongrats!!\n\nI am proud of creating JSitor, which is an alternative of JSFiddle, JSBin and CodePen.\n\nI won't say that JSitor will be the best tool but definitely it is worth to explore. Give a try and share your feedback. I would love to hear from you guys.\n\nAwesome work!\n\nI'm finding it an easier interface than codepen, and the autocomplete is great.\n\nThank you Willsmart.

I've had scoliosis and kyphosis, and I was a year or two away from needing surgery to fix it.\n\nMy girlfriend motivated me to get a personal trainer specialized in posture, and after 7 months of regular exercises and progress tracking, I'm almost finished in fixing my posture. Exercises were simple and very effective and I didn't need to buy anything to perform them. And I also could do them at home. Each month I would get a new set of exercises targeting different areas of the body that were needed to correct the posture.\n\nSo I also want to encourage anyone else that has issues with posture to seek help and try to fix it before it gets worse. Posture exercises are great and you'll feel much better after a month or two of regular exercises.\n\nI started my\n\n24 days ago and wrote on 23 days, with only one failed day and no safety-net.\n\nI've done a blogging challenge as well!

{"url": "https://dev.to/aspittel/what-productivity-looks-like-to-me-5dk5", "origin": "https://dev.to/aspittel", "title": "What Productivity Looks Like to Me - DEV Community", "content": "Posted on\n\n\u2022 Edited on\n\nFirst off, productivity is all about balance. You will not be fully productive if you don't take breaks, don't get enough sleep, or you don't take care of yourself. I do not work all the time whatsoever. I work a very standard 40 hour work week and then do 10-20 hours of side work per week. I do not do it all, I don't work non-stop, I'm not perfect.\n\nI also have a life that allows me to dedicate a lot to my side-work. I live with just my dog, I don't have children, I've been working remote for the last year and a half, and I've been single for most of my time doing side-work. I also am at a place in my career where putting in a 40 hour workweek most weeks at my day job is sufficient. It's a huge privilege that I'm able to be in the position that I am, and I know that my life will shift a lot in the future.\n\nEarly in my career, I worked a lot more than I do now -- I don't even want to do the math on how much, but it was a lot. I didn't have much balance in my life, and I let my social media-life consume me. I wanted to do it all, which wasn't possible. I ended up getting super burnt out, anxious, and unable to be as productive as I wanted to be. Balance is\n\nimportant. I can't overstate that enough. If you're dealing with burnout,\n\nwas a super helpful read to see how bad burnout can really become and how to be more balanced.\n\nI highly prioritize time with friends and family, runs with my dog, reading non-work related books, and being a total foodie in addition to my day job and the company I run. I am more than my work, and I don't want to lose my other identities.\n\nHere are some things that I've learned that help me be my most productive. This will look different for everybody, but I hope some of this is helpful.\n\nFirst off, take care of yourself. Sleeping the optimal amount for you will make you more alert and focused throughout the day. The same thing is true for drinking enough water. I also try to eat protein, fat, and carb balanced meals frequently throughout the day. I run most days and try to do other strength-based workouts too. Plus, I take a spa night on Sundays where I do face and hair masks and teeth whitening.\n\nDon't take health advice from me -- it's not what I do. Still, I do think prioritizing your health is one of the most important things you can do for your productivity and overall well-being.\n\nAs far as scheduling goes, I live by my Google Calendars. I put everything on there - I'm the person that sends my friends GCal invites for every hangout session. Otherwise, I'll forget. It's as simple as that.\n\nI have three calendars, one for my personal life, one for We Learn Code (my company), and one for my day job. Sometimes, I'll forward events to my personal calendar, so they're all in one place. If I'm super overwhelmed, I'll calendar block everything. So, I will have every minute of my day, even free time scheduled in. I don't do this often now, but it used to be really helpful for me to see my schedule upfront.\n\nNote: this was a week where I was in between jobs and had a lot I wanted to get done. I was also on vacation for the second half of the week.\n\nIn order to prioritize what I am going to work on, I first ask myself if it's something I'm passionate about. If it is, then I think about the time commitment and what I\n\nbe able to do if I decided to take on the new task. So, if I were to pick up a new freelance client, I would have to postpone working on an ebook, for example.\n\nMy greater goals and priorities have shifted over time. I initially wanted to build a bigger audience, and the activities I took on were correlated to that. Now, my financial situation has changed a bit, and I rely on my side-work being a larger portion of my income. In the future, I may prioritize more free time, which will change things again!\n\nTo help me prioritize, I use\n\nto track my time spent on every project I do -- not just paid ones. I'm even timing myself writing this post right now. I do this so that I can see where my time goes, which inefficiencies exist, and the payoff of each activity.\n\nFor example, here's my Toggl report for the week I'm writing this. Each of my projects is color-coded, and different views show my hours worked per day and listings of each activity by time.\n\nI also ask myself, \"What are the three most important things for me to get done?\". For my side work, I have three big to-do items for the week. For my day job, I do three per day. I use a pinned Google Keep sticky to keep track of these things, and I have another sticky with any time-sensitive tasks I need to do that day. Mostly things that won't take long, but need to get done then and there. Having just a few essential things to work on helps me to stay focused. I try to only work on what I've set out to do at the beginning of the week. I'm pretty dedicated to getting these few tasks done and worry a lot less about everything else.\n\nI read the book\n\nrecently. It got pretty repetitive at some points, but it does a great job at explaining how to prioritize and why prioritization matters so much. Just do what's essential, nothing more nothing less.\n\nAlso, I do not do it all myself. If there's something that makes sense for me to have someone else do, I will hire a service to handle those tasks. I do wash and fold for my laundry, I used to hire a cleaning service for my apartment, and a large portion of my diet is take-out. I'm in a privileged position to be able to outsource some of these pieces of my life, but it allows me to do more of the work that fires me up: teaching code.\n\nMotivation is also a challenging piece of doing side work, and I'm so imperfect at always being motivated. I give myself lots of breaks, and I remind myself that this I'm choosing to do. I do have some advice for getting and staying motivated.\n\nFirst, I love having groups of friends that I \"mastermind\" with. We inspire each other with our work, commiserate over the hard parts, and discuss strategies for growth. I love working with other people, and working on projects with other people or at least talking to them about those projects is a huge source of motivation for me.\n\nI also utilize the two-minute rule -- if something takes two minutes or less, I just have to get it done. Having one thing crossed off of my to-do list starts the ball rolling, and I usually get more done.\n\nSometimes, I set a timer and timebox how long I'll spend on something -- \"I don't feel like writing right now, but if I spend five minutes on it, I'll be closer to where I want to be.\" I rarely want to stop at the end of those five minutes, but it's a great trick for getting me started on something.\n\nI also am really motivated by finishing things -- leaving them half-done really bothers me. So I usually break tasks into smaller and smaller sub-tasks and focus on completing sub-tasks. This makes me feel more accomplished and like I'm making progress, so I'll be much less likely to abandon the project.\n\nOne of the most difficult things to handle when my social media following grew was the non-stop messages. From people requesting advice to spam to lovely comments about my work, I was all the sudden getting hundreds of communications a day. I receive, on average, 100 mentions on Twitter a day, 15-20 Twitter direct messages, and 50-70 emails. It's a lot.\n\nAt first, I would respond to everything. With a lot of thought and care -- essentially writing personalized blog posts for anyone who asked me a question. It wasn't scalable. I still feel some guilt, but I don't respond to everything anymore. I have so much content that's open to the public, which scales so much better than offering 1:1 advice. I also mute my own tweets after a little while if they get a lot of attention, and I have filters so I don't get any notifications from social media. I do, however, have Tweetdeck set up to show me all mentions and quote tweets so that I can quickly mass respond to people.\n\nI also have a system for my emails. I have three folders in my inboxes: today, this week, and this month. When an email comes in, I delete it or put it in one of these folders. I respond to\n\nemails every weekday,\n\nemails on Mondays, and\n\nemails at the end of the month. I also add emails that will take some time to my to-do list so that I can allot that time better. I'm also really interested in implementing\n\nemail system down the road. It seems awesome, it just takes some time to get used to.\n\nI take notes on\n\n. I take short-term notes that I won't keep forever in\n\n. Then I can archive stickies when I'm done with them. If they're something I want long term, I take notes in markdown and upload them to GitHub. I take notes during meetings I'm in, on books I read, on courses I take, etc. It's good for learning, and it gives me a synthesized version of the material to come back to.\n\nIf I have an idea for a project or a blog post, I write that thought down, otherwise, I'll forget it. I even have a notebook next to my bed for this reason!\n\nRelated to notes, I also have checklists for everything I do -- for blog posts before I publish, for recording Egghead videos, for my morning and evening routines, etc. Making a checklist makes it so I don't have to think, I can refer to the list. I am not very detail-oriented, so having the steps for something written out is so helpful, so I don't forget anything.\n\nMy morning and evening routines are all written in large text on a\n\non my fridge -- even just brushing my teeth is on there! I have my weekly workout schedule and chores list on there too.\n\nFor large projects, I usually use Trello to stay organized and motivated. I'll have checklists for each sub-task on each card. Breaking an enormous task into smaller ones helps me keep motivated and feel like I'm making progress.\n\nI've heard great things about\n\n, a book all about keeping checklists for everything. I haven't read the full text, but reading a summary of it inspired me to start creating these checklists.\n\nIf I can convince you to do one thing after reading this article, it would be to pick up\n\n. This book changed so much for me. Instead of focusing on goals, I try and focus on building up habits that make me who I want to become.\n\nI use\n\nhabit-tracker to keep track of habits I'm trying to build. Some things I have on there include: reading a chapter of a career-focused book each day, drinking enough water, and cleaning my apartment for at least 5 minutes. There's the immediate reward of having the habit change colors after it's completed, and there's an incentive to keep the habit chain going!\n\nAs far as file management goes, I keep everything on Google Drive. That way, if my laptop dies or something, I'll still have a backup. I also only keep files I'm using frequently on my computer to keep that organized. I have folders for projects and for life stuff! I also try to keep my personal and We Learn Code drives separate. Gotta keep work/side-hustle/life balance!\n\nI also keep my browser bookmarks super organized in folders. I only keep things I need, otherwise, I'll save links elsewhere -- like Pinterest or in my notes about something. Bookmarks are for links I frequently come back to. I also have a\n\nfolder filled with articles that I want to read. I try to allocate some time to get through these from time to time too!\n\nI think the term work-life balance is imperfect, but I work to make sure that I'm not working all the time. I'm someone who very much has a tendency to work a huge number of hours and to abandon other aspects of my life and health to do more work. This isn't good, and I actively work to not do this, especially since I have been much more prone to burnout recently.\n\nFirst of all, I don't have work email or Slack on my phone. I only have them on my work computer, which I don't touch outside of work hours.\n\nI also try to make my bedroom a technology-free zone. I will say this is\n\neasier when I'm not working from home -- quarantine has made this pretty much impossible. But, I find I sleep so much better if I put my phone and my computer in my living room before I sleep. I also think having dedicated workspaces when you do work from home is so helpful, and it's something I wish that I could more fully implement in my own life (darn city rent prices!).\n\nI am someone who works best without interruption and with long blocks of time. I don't do well with random 15-minute slots to work, rather I'd prefer to have one long afternoon to work. I used to do all of my blogging from the same restaurant in DC, Busboys and Poets. I'd go there every Sunday afternoon and crank out a post. Having that routine and that long block of time was perfect for me.\n\nI also work best in the afternoon as compared to mornings or nights, though in college, late nights were my everything. I usually do side work immediately after my normal workday ends and on weekend afternoons. Everyone is going to be so different with this -- experiment and find times that work best for you!\n\nI know that the\n\ntechnique works really well for some people, but I work best in long focused blocks. I tend to follow the\n\ninstead. I take breaks when I need to or when I finish a task, but frequent breaks aren't helpful for me, nor do I need them.\n\nSometimes, I have a tendency to get distracted. Especially by social media and the internet more generally. During times like that, I'll use the\n\napp to avoid distracting sites. Sometimes I'll even shut off the internet in my apartment if I really want to get some writing done.\n\nOne additional productivity system I find super helpful is batching. Batching is when you do a bunch of similar activities at once. So, for example, when I did Instagram I would write all my captions for the month at one time, and I'd pre-create graphics and find images. Or when I'm filming videos, I'll do multiple at once. When you're in one headspace it can be optimal to keep doing similar tasks instead of changing your focus to something else.\n\nhas some excellent content on why batching is so great.\n\nMy productivity system is just that --\n\nsystem. Don't feel like you need to adopt all of this or follow any of it. I just hope it's helpful to have a peek into my life and the things that help me. Remember -- balance is\n\nimportant and looks different for everyone. I'm so far from perfect, and I think it can seem like I do so much more than I actually do on social media. I am also in a place in my life where I can spend time on side-work, and I love doing it. Please let me know if you have any questions, or I can answer any questions on\n\n!\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nI'm going to give Toggl a try!\n\nThanks for the article <3\n\nDefinitely use Toggle! I recently started using it and loved it!\n\nsomeone with my style of productivity! Techniques like Pomodoro never made sense to me; I tend to zone into an activity for hours at a time before needing a break. I've been in a quarantine-induced rut lately, so something like Toggl and the \"Flowtime\" technique should definitely help with visualizing my todos day-to-day.\n\nA lot of gems in here. Bookmarking in case I need motivation in the future \ud83d\ude01\n\nVery cool your publication. I really liked Google Keep, it will help me a lot in the division between my school studies and computer technician studies and with my remote repository on GitHub, because sometimes I get very excited, I start coding at 8 am and I stop just for lunch, so I start again and so on until 4 in the morning. I completely forget that I need to study for the entrance exam to enter a university.\n\nI like your thoughts about concentration, reminds me of\n\nprinciples you can find in Cal Newport\u2019s book. I\u2019m just\n\nabout improving as a developer, and I put a big focus on productivity, with one chapter dedicated to deep work :)\n\nGreat article! It seems that you have been working on yourself for a long time and also observing and analyzing all the records and documents too. Just a guess though! I loved many short, sweet, straight but very effective sentences like whatever you have said in the very first paragraph and in the conclusion. Thanks for sharing what has worked for you! Kudos to your efforts... Have a productive day ahead... Keep shining, Keep inspiring \ud83d\ude03\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf8a\n\nHey guys, I have been working on my very first APIs project and in that project I'm making a \"QUIZ APP\", where from an API. I have been taking 10 question and giving them multiple choices and at end they will be getting scored. I'm using NODE.JS, EXPRESS, REQUEST, EJS for the app.\n\nThe problem comes here when i get a string from API. I change it to an object using JSON.parse() and sending it to EJS files and then displayed. but when their are symbols in question like \", ' , and more they are displayed as &139; , \" like that.\n\nAlways interesting to read others' routines. I've recently added kaizen to my workflow, meaning that I look for a small step to improve a process every day. It had the most impact on my personal life so far. For example, yesterday I improved the way I prepare avocado for eating (there's a better way to deal with kernels than what I had been doing). I got the ideas from\n\n.\n\nAnother tool that I use in a similar way to the flowtime technique is RescueTime checking the report from time to time to see in which categories I was working on and how the time was spent.\n\nI have tried Pomodoro technique and I am on the same page as you that I don't need breaks too often. Will try to understand what is Flowtime, thanks for sharing this \ud83d\udc4d\n\nnote taking and scheduling has always seemed as a work itself...\n\ni guess it takes practice to implement it as a daily habit :)\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

I'm an extrovert, and the social environment at work helps to motivate me and get me through the day. That being said, due to COVID and the evolving nature of tech work, I've been working remote for almost two years. There are a lot of benefits to it, like no commute time, the ability to live wherever, more flexibility, and accessibility. Also, I know it's a huge privilege to be able to work remote during this time, and so few of my non-tech friends have that ability. But, for me, working remote doesn't come naturally. So, I wanted to write down my strategies for making it as enjoyable as possible.\n\nI also want to note before starting that right now many of us are working through the stress of a pandemic, shifting to new modalities at work, struggling with economic instability and unemployment, shifting childcare responsibilities, and dealing with health concerns for ourselves and our families. None of this is normal, make sure to take time for yourself and it's okay to not be okay.\n\nThis may sound super corny, but mentally having some sort of \"commute\" to work in the morning and after work in the evening creates some separation in your day. I have a dog, which makes this even easier -- I walk her at the beginning of the day before work and then take her to the park at the end of the day. I also have time to sneak in a bit of a podcast or an audiobook too.\n\nWhen I started working remote, I lived alone. It made work from home really hard because if I didn't actively make plans, I could go days without talking to another human. Earlier this year, I moved in with my partner. Now, I am guaranteed to talk to someone pretty much every day, and I feel much less isolated.\n\nEven if living with another person isn't a reality, having a pet really helps. Having Blair, my dog, makes me get out of the house, and I still have someone with me all day, even if she isn't human. I get cuddles during my breaks, and I even sometimes get a ball thrown at me!\n\nWhen I started working remote, I lived in an apartment that had essentially been my crash pad before. It was in a perfect location, but wasn't very large and was very old -- it didn't even have a real kitchen! I worked out of a desk in my bedroom. So, I was pretty much in that room for 22+ hours a day. It wasn't great for me mentally to not have a separate workspace, and there wasn't much separation between my work and the rest of my life. I know it isn't realistic for everyone, especially those with families or who live in cities with high rent and low square footage, but having a dedicated workspace that you can close off at the end of the day is\n\nand helps you really separate work and the rest of your life.\n\nEarlier this year when the pandemic hit, I lived in a very old studio apartment in NYC, and while it was in the perfect location, it also had a horrible mouse problem, the temperature was always off, and I was pretty much in the same room 24 hours a day. It was miserable.\n\nMoving out of that environment has made working from home much more bearable. Especially since my company has a work from home budget. Getting a comfortable chair, a monitor setup that works for me, and customizations that fit my personality make my workday so much more enjoyable. It has also become a lot more important for me to live in a nice space, and instead of prioritizing living close to work or right downtown, I'm more concerned with living somewhere that's updated, doesn't have a lot of issues, and has space to move around.\n\nEven though I think it's really helpful to have a dedicated workspace, I also move throughout my apartment throughout the day. I do a few hours of work at my desk, then take calls from the couch or the dining room table if I don't need a monitor. It's nice to change the scenery and have a different chair at some point in the day. It helps me re-focus as the day goes on.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of working in an office is the ability to grab or eat lunch with work friends each day. Something I do at least once a week is schedule a lunchtime video call with a friend, whether they are inside of my company or external. It really breaks up the day, recharges me, and keeps those connections intact.\n\nOne of the really nice parts of working remote is that other than calls, you can normally schedule your day to fit your schedule and how you work best rather than being standardized to a 9-5. I often read the advice to always get ready for work. I instead normally put on makeup and get dressed nicely mid-day when I don't have early meetings. I also sometimes take runs during my lunch break, and I often work a 7-3 or 8-4 day instead of 9-5. Use the flexibility to your advantage and work a schedule that fits your needs.\n\nThis is much less relevant now since there's a pandemic going on, but I think it's so important to still socialize with friends and do things outside of your house. It can be tempting to become a hermit since you have to actively leave your house to do things after work, but you still need social interaction and to experience life outside your living space. I find making plans with friends makes me more accountable and likely to do things. Even now, setting up virtual or park hangouts adds some variety to the day!\n\nThis is, again, more of a post-pandemic recommendation, but before COVID I used to do co-working days with friends who also work remote. I would either have them over, or we would meet at a coffee shop and we would work together on each of our work tasks. It's a great opportunity to catch up and have the opportunity to have someone to chat with throughout the day.\n\nOne of the things I miss most about working in an office is unstructured discussion time with colleagues. Most remote calls have a structure and an agenda, but so much valuable brainstorming comes from free-flowing discussions. On past teams, we've scheduled watercooler time or virtual team happy hours, and it's been great to get to know one another and come up with ideas.\n\nEven though most things are remote now, having a community who understands what you do and who you can learn from is so important. I love so many Discord and Slack groups in addition to public forums like DEV and Twitter. They allow me to stay involved with the larger developer community.\n\nRemote work is an increasing piece of work in tech, and I know that it's a really amazing thing for a lot of people, especially parents and those who are disabled. There are many nice pieces of it, like being able to live wherever, no commute times, and the flexibility. That being said, the decrease in work/life separation and the decrease in social time also makes it difficult. Also, this year we aren't just working remote, we are working during a pandemic -- and many people have additional responsibilities as a result. I hope these tips are helpful!\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nI think it's a very important article! Not everyone will be naturally prone to working remote. One thing I have been thinking about lately is how to foster a remote company culture that is actually fun to work in? Remote video calls are good but there's no substitute for face to face interactions (yet). In the remote community there's been so much focus on co-workers who don't like each other and they are forced into an office, watercooler drama, etc. but what about if the co-workers are kickass and it's a genuine fun experience to interact.\n\nalso I was wondering: how to make remote video lunches not turn into some kind of weird live ASMR session ? \ud83e\udd23\n\nYeah I guess everything has pros and cons. Personally I like remote work, even before everyone was forced to. So I already made sure my work space is very nice.\n\nI think it's important to be disciplined and be good at planning if you work from home, otherwise there is no routine and boundaries. Also, for parents I think it's extra challenge, especially if they have limited space. But perhaps WFH also allows people to move to suburb or smaller and less expensive city/town, so they can actually afford better living standard.\n\nAnyone have a link to that wallpaper \ud83d\udc40\n\nYes!\n\nThank you!! \ud83d\udc95\n\nExcellent advice. I've done a lot of these same things for most of my career (which has been 95% WFH self-employment).\n\nI will add, I suggest finding a group of friends that can do social time on video calls of some kind. I've been seriously considering an early morning \"Coffe with Seth\" type stuff to give other early birds like me someone to chit chat with about work stuff, or to just shoot the breeze at a regularly scheduled time.\n\nI've actually found myself really engaged with streamers when I never was before. That can be a lot of fun to find a small streamer and get to interact with whatever they are doing. I enjoy being helpful when I can.\n\nThanks for this post! Although I am not an extrovert, I\u2019m way on the opposite end it is important to be mindful of how we are spending our days now. It\u2019s been a real balance trying to make sure I stay healthy mentally and not fall into becoming a hermit. I have resorted to forming a pod with basically my partner and housemates and that has been super helpful to stay active.\n\nis that 13\" mac comfortable to work for you? I previously tried to work on it on a previous job, but without an external monitor it was horrible, such a small screen to work. Never considered a 16\" instead of this one? Or mobility is your top priority there?\n\nGreat post Ali\n\nThanks for this!! Having a separate place to work and pets really help\n\nYES, I agree with all those great ideas.\n\nMy FAV; Get out of the house! Feeling pent up? For people with yards or front porches, just sit outside for 5 minutes. Get that Vitamin D!\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

In a recent\n\n, we discussed computer science degrees, bootcamps, and self-directed learning. Each has benefits and have brought a lot of people into the world of programming. Each also has challenges. All four of us have had unique paths to programming, so here are our stories.\n\nI was a biology major in college and then quickly realized that I was terrible at it. So, I switched to actuarial science where I took an intro to computer science course and totally fell in love with binary, hexadecimal, and octal systems. The rest is really history. I studied computer science and my first language was Java. I was a little bit of a late bloomer but I thoroughly enjoy it.\n\nI got started when I was 11 years old. I wanted to build my own community on Neopets. If you\u2019re not familiar with what Neopets is, it\u2019s this Web site where you can have your own virtual pet and you can feed it and play games. You can have your own communities and all kinds of stuff.\n\nI really wanted to build my own community and customize it. But you need to know how to code to do that. So, I asked my dad for an HTML book and my first book was HTML goodies. I thought it was awesome and a lot of fun.\n\nFast forward to high school, and I took AP Computer Science. My first language in high school was Java, and I was so bad at it that I needed a tutor just to pass the class. I was like \"I\u2019m never going to do this ever.\" But, you know, obviously, 17 years later and I\u2019m very clearly still coding, so something eventually clicked but it wasn\u2019t Java.\n\nI was an admin assistant really aimlessly going through my job; I was miserable. My dad suggested coding to me and was like \"worst case scenario if you hate it you could try something else.\"\n\nSo, he bought me an \u201dIntroduction to Drupal\u201d book and \u2013 quite frankly, I do not recommend starting out as Drupal when you\u2019re learning to code but that\u2019s how I did. I just continue learning, continue working in the mornings before work. Then I got my first Drupal job.\n\nA few years into that I started learning about accessibility. Then a year or so after that I started learning about React and VueJS and I\u2019m now a React developer and the rest is kind of history.\n\nI learned to code when I was a sophomore in college. I had no idea what coding even was, but I had an extra course block available. I decided to sign up for it because people kept telling me, \u201dIt\u2019s a good thing to learn and it\u2019ll help you no matter what.\u201d\n\nI honestly thought that I was going to be learning how to format Word documents or something like that - I had no idea what code was. But, I was instead writing Python. It was super fun: we were building games. I just thought it was magical how you could put stuff together and have a program come out of it.\n\nI completely reconfigured my schedule and was like I\u2019m going to double major in computer science, this is my future. So, I started my second class which was in C++ and it was a super intense \"Data Structures and Algorithms\" class, which was also a weed out class. I was pulling all-nighters and working so hard in that class just to understand it. I did come out of it with a good grade. I thought \"if I have to work this hard for it, it means that I\u2019m not good enough at it. This is really just not for me.\"\n\nThen when I was a Junior in college I had an internship doing mostly Excel data analysis type work, and I figured out that I could automate a lot of my own job using the Python skills that I had. So, from there, I got a software engineering internship and transitioned to working full time in code.\n\nYou can listen to the\n\nwhere we discussed our thoughts on bootcamps, computer science degrees, and self-directed learning as well as advice for everyone in the midst of their journies.\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nI love origin stories!\n\nI think the major takeaway is that it doesn't matter how you get started - just get started, and keep going.  Each of your backgrounds is so different; it's a testament to the fact that there is no one 'right' way to get started.  Just find something you like doing - and keep doing that.\n\nThanks for sharing!\n\nI love hearing \"where did you fell in love with computers\" stories \ud83e\udd29\n\nKeep rocking!\n\nLoved Lindsey\u2019s story, my first job was as a Drupal developer! I feel your pain. Love this.\n\nStrong women \ud83d\udcaa\n\ndoes it have a caption? I knew it's excessive asking...\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

{"url": "https://dev.to/ladybug/thoughts-on-being-a-digital-nomad-55i6", "origin": "https://dev.to/aspittel", "title": "Thoughts on Being a Digital Nomad - DEV Community", "content": "Posted on\n\n\u2022 Originally published at\n\nAlmost two years ago, I donated almost everything I owned and left DC. I was at a job that wasn't the right fit for me, and I didn't know my future. I decided that rather than signing a new lease, I'd instead mostly live at tech conferences for the summer and crash at my parents' in between, and then start living out of AirBnBs in the Fall. I ended up retiring from the digital nomad lifestyle in order to work in an office gain (which started 3 days before the COVID shutdown \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f). That being said, I think this is a pretty unique experience, but more people may be able to do the same as remote work becomes more popular and (hopefully) the pandemic starts to subside. So, I wanted to write down my thoughts and advice on the experience.\n\nI personally chose to live out of AirBnBs. The longer you book a place, the more discount you get normally. So, I'd book a place for a month at a time. The cost for AirBnB pluses ended up being less than my DC rent most months. The van life idea is so appealing to me, but the mechanical knowledge needed and the potential lack of internet intimidates me. I also personally stayed in the United States because of my dog, I didn't want to quarantine her which you need to do with most international countries.\n\nI travelled from city to city in my car, which was super nice. I was able to visit a bunch of sites nearby cities instead of just staying downtown, which I may have had to without a car.\n\nI chose cities by expense, activities available, and their proximity to National Parks. My biggest bucket list item is to visit all of the National Parks, so this very much helped in that goal. I loved being able to experience different areas, taste test different restaurants, and to never get bored of my surroundings. I also was using it as a way to vet cities before settling down -- I didn't know where I wanted to move longterm, so this was a way of trying out different cities.\n\nTaxes can get\n\ncomplicated if you're moving around a bunch, especially if you move internationally or are self-employed (or just have side gigs like me). I hired an accountant who specializes in digital nomads, and it's such a weight off my chest.\n\nis his site in case you're interested.\n\nThere were two really difficult attributes of travel for me: the first was loneliness, the second was the lack of a routine. It's pretty tough to get to know people when you aren't staying in a city for long. Something I would probably prioritize if I did this again would be to go to cities with a big tech scene so I could go to meetups and potentially speak at them. I was also single at the time, so doing this with a partner or a family would probably help in that regard. As far as having a routine, I was changing where I lived every month. So it's difficult to get too settled. Part of that was nice, I would go on hikes every morning with my dog in Asheville and would go to a neighborhood coffee shop in Nashville. But, I definitely missed having a set workday schedule.\n\nOverall, it's an experience I really enjoyed and would highly recommend if your work and life situations allow it. I would probably go back to being a digital nomad once the country re-opens and my partner was able to work remote. If you're interested in moving internationally,\n\nthis Ladybug episode. Please\n\nany questions to me, I'd love to help out!\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nThis is exactly what I would like to do but kinda afraid to take the plunge. I too had a plan to visit different cities and just go to tech conferences and meetups but I\u2019m unsure if I should without a car and use public transport or not. Also I am a freelancer so it\u2019s feast or famine when it comes to money.\n\nCosmic timing Ali ! I\u2019m about to do this my self.. I\u2019ve been at a job that allows me to do this for about a year now , and my lease is up in July , so as soon as it is , I want to sell all my stuff and do it while I\u2019m still single and not having kids\n\nThank you so much for the heads up , in regards to loneliness and lack of routing - being a creature of habit I think I too would seriously miss this aspect Of everyday existence the most  ...\n\nPerHaps if I stayed longer than a month , like at least 3 at a time , it would enough to feel settled in .\n\nAnd to combat loneliness - I am pretty violently extroverted and usually end up making friends wherever I go .. just difficult when they don\u2019t speak English .\n\nAwesome! Yeah, hopefully by then things will be more open and you can go to events. I think that will be really helpful :)\n\nReally cool to share this experience! I would love to do something similar in Europe but am always a bit scared about the lack of routine and how hard would it be to meet people and build relationships in short term.\n\nThis post inspired me though! Thank you\n\nWhat if you are planning this in the country where you live right now.?\n\nI would be less scared if I plan it \"smaller\".\n\nAnd probably you already will get some good experience and confidence to do it in the whole Europe.\n\nThat is also a valid idea :) I am living in Austria currently, so small country if compared to where I come from, but still there are other cities where would be cool to live for a while!\n\nNeat! Thanks for sharing, especially the accountant bit!\n\nWe plan to launch in 2023. I joined a community called\n\nlast year, and I'll be keeping my membership up until the big day because there is just so much to learn! There are people in this community that do it with AirBnB like you. One of the other benefits is the private small groups in the community, such as the one for IT Professionals.\n\nStarlink will be in full swing by then, so hopefully we'll be more connected than ever so that we can be more disconnected than ever. Wrap your mind around that!\n\nOne of the things you said really stood out to me, and that was your comment about DC rent. In Annapolis we are are shelling out $3,700 a month between childcare and rent, and I didn't know how well that would prepare me for places like Norway which famously costs you about $25-35 dollars for fish and chips and a pint. Cool, we do that, too!\n\nIt comes up a lot in the group, because there is someone experiencing the digital nomad life at every level from financially independent to the most frugal families you've ever met. The first question I asked was whether or not I was ridiculous for wanting a 5th wheel for the three of us when there are people cramming 12 into a vintage Airstream, and I found that it's all about what is comfortable for you. It set me at ease. This is going to be our home for a few years while we are roadschooling/unschooling, after all.\n\nOh, and national parks are high on our list, too. \ud83d\ude04 I want to fill out one of the passports.\n\nWow, that sounds awesome!\n\nI consider every now and then to \"travel\" around the UK.\n\nAs I am not working in IT yet, my plan is/was to apply a global company which has stores around the country, so I can transfer myself between stores/businesses.  So, I would spend 2-5 months in each city on my list, keep working so I have income and the same time I explore everything in my free time.\n\nAs I came from another country without partner or family member, I already have experience how to spend my free time without feeling alone or lonely.\n\nThere are some really cool meetups and activity groups around the country which I would love to visit.\n\nWhat a cool goal you had! Staying nearby National Parks! If the possibility to work remotely stays in my company, I'd also consider moving closer to the mountains.\n\nThanks for sharing, Ali! I'm planning to be a digital nomad from next year first locally (in my country) and then internationally for the next few years.\n\nIt sounds exciting. Where would you like to go? Which cities are on your list?\n\nWe are planning to do the same next year, but go around Europe and Asia - I will document our adventures as digital nomads :)\n\nWhat a wonderful way to work, Id welcome the private time and time for me. That sounds like a bucket list item I may need to add.\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

Writing articles; making videos; released my first course early this year :D\n\nI want to be what I am now...\n\n...but perhaps making enough money to survive. :)\n\nTo summarize, I'm a writer, programmer, cook, interviewer, poet, musician, masseur, coach, speaker, and more.

I traded stability for chaos, and I love it, except for the financial part now.\n\nI don't mix with grown up careers well. :)\n\nThat is so freaking cool -- sounds like a dream to be able to combine all of your interests!

I can tell I am going in that direction and I hope I can continue to achieve the good parts of that situation.\n\nAlong these lines, I really appreciated this post:\n\nWe humans must find a certain contentment in whatever situation we find ourselves in, but in terms of situations to position one's self to be in.

Not many Romanians know about it. It\u2019s more of a regional thing. The people who would cook and eat \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie used to be shepherds. It\u2019s also possible that other cultures have a similar dish but I haven\u2019t yet met someone from outside my family that can describe anything similar to \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie.\n\n\u021a\u0103c\u0103lie is rich in calories and fat and it\u2019s best served hot. The caloric value it offers is extremely important for people like shepherds because of the long hours on the cold mountains. The ingredients and method of making \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie are also accessible. All they\u2019d have to do is carry a chunk of pig fat, some bread and an onion, then make a little fire.\n\nFor me \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie used to be a normal thing, whenever we\u2019d have a family BBQ, \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie was the first thing we made. I really enjoyed it as a kid and took years to learn the proper way of cooking it. Anybody can easily cook \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie but it takes multiple attempts to get all the little details right and perfect your method. This will only lead to the best of \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie, so well cooked that angles will weep for a taste of it.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until high school and talking with some friends that I realised I am the only one who knows about \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie.\n\nI cooked some \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie for some friends of mine and some couldn\u2019t even dare taste it. For some it is\n\nextremely heavy (you\u2019ll understand why shortly).\n\nWarning: Vegans and vegetarians will flee when exposed to \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie\n\n(pig fat with rind, Romanians call it\n\n)\n\nFor cooking you\u2019ll also need a stick (size matters, anything between 30-50cm should be good enough). Make sure the stick is strong enough to hold the chunk of pig fat and not too dry (spoiler alert, it all goes above a fire).\n\nWarning: Do not use a metal stick, the pig fat will slide right out after heating up. I recommend a cherry tree branch with a sharpened tip.\n\nTo get things started slightly cut your pig fat on all sides (excluding the skin side). Do not make the cuts too deep, as it could make it fall apart later. We do this to allow for better and more evenly cooking.\n\nNow cut the bread (slices, about 1cm thick, you can do thicker slices if you feel \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie is too heavy for you) and onion (any shape or size you like, I prefer rings). Place the onions slices/rings on the slices of bread and set everything near your grill.\n\nAt this point you should start your fire. Do not let the flame burn out, \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie is cooked using the flame not active charcoal. Take your stick and put the tip of it inside the fire (enough to chahr it, but don\u2019t set it on fire). Stick your chunk of pig fat on the stick.\n\nThis bit might sound easy but it\u2019s quite tricky to get it right. At this point you should have your chunk of slan\u0103 on the stick, your fire is roaring and the bread with onions is nearby.\n\nRepeat this process until each slice is covered in as much fat as you wish (see final product bellow for reference).\n\nTip: You can use some of the dripping fat to keep the fire alive or to extend it to new sections of the BBQ, thus ensuring you equally activate your charcoal.\n\nTip: When dripping fat on the bread, feel free to slowly and gently press the slan\u0103 on the bread.\n\nMaster tip: Sometimes the tip of your stick will set on fire.\n\n, this is the best thing that could happen but be careful. You can now tilt your stick with the tip facing almost completely down. Keep the stick above the bread and watch how the tiny flame will make the pig fat drip.\n\nAfter doing the above\n\na couple of times you will notice the exterior of the pig fat is cooked, at this point set it near your bread and start cutting the outer layer, revealing more raw uncooked pig fat ready for roasting.\n\nThe cooked fat is placed on top of the bread for added unhealthy pure tastiness.\n\nTip: At the point when you start cutting the first layer of cooked slan\u0103, you might want to take a short break and eat a slice, as \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie is best served hot. Reheating it is an option.\n\nNote: After cutting outer layers, make sure to make some more cuts on the surface to allow for more fat dripping and better roasting.\n\nAgain, repeat the above until all pig fat is cooked. Depending on the rind you have, it may be easy to bite trough and crunchy or extremely tough. It is comestible tho and I personally enjoy it.\n\nThis is how the final product should look like:\n\nIf you weren\u2019t disgusted by possibly the most unhealthy edible thing you\u2019ve ever heard, then you should know a couple of things."}

It was a nice sunny day, hopped on the early 7:45 train to Hope,\n\n. Little did I know that was the start of my new hobby and passion, hiking; as I recently went to Peak District again, done\n\nand the\n\ntrails. More on this down bellow.\n\nI tried to cover the most important aspects of my trip, but hiking is all about the moment and the experience. Hard to put into words the beauty of nature.\n\nBy far the best thing about going away from the day to day city craze, was the silence. After the train left the station, all I could hear was \u2026 nothing. Pure silence. It then occurred to me, that I have\n\nsomething, in a very long time. I had forgotten what silence was; the pure tranquility sensation.\n\nOn the first Hike, I did the climb to Ladybower Dam and got to see quite a bit of nature, the rural areas around Hope and saw how friendly outdoorsy people are. Everyone would salute you and people were more than eager to give directions and help you.\n\nAfter the rather easy hike to the dam, I went up to Win hill, where the view was very rewarding, as the climb is on some steep rocks trough a forested area with a stream of water on the side. From the peak you could see all around the valley and could even see the dam. The walk back down was much easier and quicker as it followed a path down and around the hill instead of climbing rocks.\n\nI would say that the first hiking experience wasn\u2019t that eventful, but nonetheless it was a special moment and the start of something beautiful.\n\nThis took place mid October on a cloudy day with some light rain. The hike was considerably longer than the first one (10km), and this time it involved walking across the peaks of Loose Hill. The view was nice, but due to the clouds and fog, visibility was limited.\n\nThe best part of this hike was the end destination, and what would end up becoming my new post-hike\n\n.\n\nA nice cozy place, right next to Edale Station. The staff there are like a big family, they\u2019re friendly and warm. The decor of the restaurant is homy and the food is just what you need after a long hike. On Sunday they have roast (pork or beef) with veggies and Yorkshire pudding. They also sell local ales (which are some of the best and most refreshing beers I\u2019ve had). To get an idea of how good the beer is, I asked if they sell bottles of the stuff (sadly no), so next time I\u2019ll see if I can bring my own bottle \ud83c\udf7a.\n\nThey are welcoming people, \u201cmuddy boots are welcome\u201d and \u201cdogs are welcome\u201d.\n\nLast weekend I spontaneously decided to go hiking again. I simply craved it, weather was good (by UK standards) and train tickets were still cheap. So I did it. Since my last hike I even invested in a hydration pack and some light, foldable, and strong hiking poles (which came in handy!).\n\nThe hike started off with a superb walk above a brook, trees with red, orange and yellow leaves, you get to cross a couple of rustic looking wooden bridges. The brooks valley even gets narrower and the hills on both sides are quite steep, giving an amazing feel when walking between em.\n\nAbout 2km in, the hike transforms into a little bit of a climb. The path becomes one with the brook and you have to carefully navigate your way from rock to rock on the brook. Then the elevation begins to take off, you start climbing up some rocks, with the brook still there. Making this a treacherous climb where one must be very confident in every move. The climb is about 1km with an elevation gain of 500m. For me that\u2019s the steepest path I had to take so far, but the climb is full of breathtaking scenery and as you go higher you get to see more and more of where you came from.\n\nUpon reaching the peak, you realise it\u2019s actually a plateau and you can see the entire valley where you walked. A little further in, most people will proceed to climb to an even higher peak, but not me. My trail map said\n\nand so I did.\n\nWhat was I expecting? From the map, I knew the trail would pass trough the\n\n. I expected a nice area, abundant in vegetation and tall trees, you know\n\n.\n\nWhat did I get?\n\nThe path I followed (at this point alone, as everybody else would go in the opposite direction) was next to a water stream and as such the ground was rather muddy and soft. Then the trail map said\n\nand so I did. After a while I found myself in a rather muddy area, with no visible path and no obvious direction to follow. The sun was still out and I was about 1/3 of the trail in so I pushed forward.\n\nAfter a kilometre of walking trough some rather shitty conditions (mud and weird terrain), fog set in out of a sudden; combined with the lack of a path and the only direction I knew being\n\n, I pushed on like any sane person would do.\n\nNot 5 minutes later I was in the middle of a post-apocalyptic scenario. Fog everywhere, terrain at this point was composed of\n\ncombined with\n\nand\n\n.\n\nThis is when it hit me. I am in a swamp.\n\nThere were many questions going on in my head at the time:\n\nI realised that I might not have the time (sunset was 2-3 hours away) to juggle around the terrain of the swamp, so I took a split second decision and I started going\n\nin the hopes of intersecting with the public footpath sooner rather than later.\n\nAfter adventuring trough the swamp like a mad man, trying to reach some solid ground. Getting mud all over my boots and pants, finding a rather suspicious metal box under some rocks and getting bad looks from frogs, I eventually got out of the fog, away from the mud and reached the Pennine footpath where I slowly walked my way back to Edale.\n\nIt was definitely an experience that I will not forget. And honestly I would do it again, this time going trough the entire swamp and maybe even see\n\n.\n\nI didn\u2019t cover the entire trip, there were other sights to see, like Jacob\u2019s ladder and the High Peak area.\n\nMore hiking stories to come (with full HD videos of the entire trip)."}

I hacked into their computer and captured the USB traffic on it. Could you help me steal the secret?\n\nFlag format: flag{0-9a-z_} (Convert uppercase to lowercase)\n\nAttachments:\n\nFor this challenge, we are given a pcapng that contains USB protocol packets.\n\nMost of the packets are input packets labeled as\n\nby wireshark. There are, however, a few exceptions:\n\nThis packet and the one below it caught my attention because they are both output packets and contains ascii characters that resemble some sort of programming language.\n\nI copied one of the lines and did a quick google search.\n\nis what I found - a TSPL/TSPL2 Programming Language manual. Just like how 3d printers are controlled using G-code, it seems like that printers also have their own programming language.\n\nHere are the commands within the two packets:\n\nThe second packet seems to be the one that actually draws out the flag using two different commands:\n\nand\n\n. Now, I just have to implement the two commands in python and get the flag.\n\nHere is the code for that:\n\nIn the end, we get an image with the flag:\n\nflag:\n\nwho likes singing, dancing, rapping and shell-coding?\n\nThe directories on the server looks something like this:\n\nnc 139.180.215.222 20002\n\nnc 106.52.252.82 20002\n\nAttachments:\n\nAfter a quick analysis of the binary given, we see that the binary reads in 7 bytes of data, zero out most of the registers, and executes the data as shellcode.\n\n7-byte is not a lot. The\n\ninstruction itself takes up 2 bytes. Due to this size limitation, I decided to go with a two-stage approach. First, I will craft a 7-byte payload that will make a read syscall and read in a second stage payload. Second, I will craft a second stage payload that is more than 7 bytes and perform whatever task I want without worrying about any size limitations.\n\nI ran the binary in gdb just to see the state of the registers when our shellcode is being called. This is helpful as it allows us to utilize some of the existing register values:\n\nAs you can see, there\u2019s not a lot to work with, but we do have the address of the current buffer loaded in rdi.\n\nIn order to make the read syscall, we need four things:\n\nWe know that the syscall itself takes up 2 bytes and copying the address of the current buffer from rdi to rsi takes at least 2 bytes. This leaves us 3 bytes to zero out rdi and make rdx a large number:\n\nMy first idea was to move the address of the current buffer to rdx as it is quite a large number; however, it turns out to be too large and would not work.\n\nLooking for inspiration, I came across\n\n. Although it is written for 32 bit instead of 64 bit, it is still quite useful and helped me came up with my final payload:\n\nThis payload only uses 6 bytes of space! It relayed on the fact that\n\nis a single byte instruction, and due to its 32 bit nature, the current address is truncated to only 4 bytes before being loaded into rdx.\n\nNow, we successfully bypassed the size limitation and can run whatever code we want; however, the execve syscall seems to be blocked on the server. Bummer!\n\nBut we can still do an open/read/write to get the flag right? Well, now is a good time to review the challenge description:\n\nThe directories on the server looks something like this:\n\nAs you can see, the flag is hidden in a nested folder, and we need a way to find the path for the flag file.\n\nBasically, we need a way to list the content in a given directory. The first thing that came to me was the\n\ncommand, so I ran a strace on it:\n\nAll that we need is two syscalls:\n\nwhich opens a file descriptor for a given path and\n\nwhich list out the content of a directory.\n\nWith the help of the shellcraft module in pwntools, I quickly created a payload that can read out the content of a given directory:\n\nAnother minor inconvenience is the fact that the\n\nsyscall returns a linux_dirent struct for each file which needs to be parsed. Lucky, we can do that on the client side with python instead of parsing it with assembly:\n\nNow, with the ability to list all files in a given directory, we just need a program to recursively go through all the folders and find the flag file.\n\nBecause the server always timeouts before the flag file can be found, I also added the functionality to preserve progress so that I can get the path using multiple sessions.\n\nHere is the final code:\n\nWith this code, I found the flag file located at\n\n.\n\nNow with a simple payload, we can read out the flag:\n\nflag:"}

I got a letter which asked to be present at the customs office in 3 days.\n\nI went to the customs office. Had a talk with a super helpful lady, who helped me get my shipment. She then asked me to open the package, did an inspection of what was shipped. Finally, she told me the import duty  which I had to pay for the shipment. In less than 15 minutes I was out of the office and my job was done.\n\nOne month ago someone again shipped me a piece of gadget. This time it was sent to Kathmandu, Nepal. FedEx told me that my shipment was at the airport customs and I had to get hold of an agent at the customs to get my shipment. They delivered me the documents which I could use to extract the shipment.\n\nAll good and fine. I talked to an agent and handed him my documents, which were to be used to extract the shipment from the customs. I hoped it to be a quick and painless process. Unfortunately, the introduction of an agent to the process keeps us in the dark; Now, I have no idea what\u2019s going on in customs land.\n\nEach of my discussion with the customs agent was basically that the shipment couldn\u2019t be extracted and they\u2019ll try again tomorrow. After ~20 days I pushed the agent a little and tried to get more details. According to them, someone had shipped gold via FedEx which is why customs were not letting any FedEx document be extracted.\n\nI went to the customs office, and It was chaotic. It took me hours to find the right person to talk to. Basically, just to hear the same gold story again.\n\nIn the mean time, I mentioned this to FedEx as well, the only support they could give me was \u201cI\u2019ll talk to my superior and see how we can help you here\u201d\n\nFast forward today, I still don\u2019t have my shipment. Nepal Government still doesn\u2019t have the customs duty they deserve. Lose-Lose situation. Unless, my shipment has been hijacked and a customs official has gifted it to his son. Then, someone does win here. Believe me, I have heard stories of that happening.\n\nThis process is seriously messed up and is the story of pretty much every government office in Nepal. The processes in offices are so chaotic, super ad-hoc and enough touch points to exploit a person. Which is also the reason why going to a government office is a dreadful experience every time.\n\nOur systems are messed up, our processes are messed up and the sad part is that there is no one doing anything about it. The only place one can complain or state grievances is to a twitter handle (or bot) of HelloSarkar. It definitely gives one a feeling of being heard, but nothing happens in the end.\n\nThis one time, all I have is a rant. No solutions, No actions that can be taken to make things better. If there is something that we can do, please enlighten me. I\u2019m all ears.\n\nUpdate : I did get my shipment eventually"}

Contrary to the fact that a lot would suggest to do it at a startup, I wanted to do it at a big company because I have never worked at one and wanted to learn from that experience. It must be magic to manage so many people, so many developers and still spit out the best of the products.\n\nI applied to number of companies but I would like to comment on my experience with facebook, microsoft and mozilla. Facebook was kind of sad because I had an interview where I was asked some basic questions about JavaScript and we talked about how some things were implemented in facebook. Post the interview, they didnt reply for about a month and when I contacted the recruiter, got a reply that I couldn\u2019t be offered a postition. Sad :\u2018(\n\nNext was Microsoft. This one was really surprising because the interviewer asked me some really random question and two puzzles and eventually replied with a negative. Maybe I was supposed to not solve the puzzles.\n\nWhen all this action was happening, I had also applied for an internship at mozilla. This was one that I had some expectations from, mostly because I had been a contributor to mozilla for some time and luckily there was an open internship position for a project that I had already been contributing to. I applied and Kaboom, \u201cwe did not find a fit this time\u201d. This was very disheartening, but I eventually talked to one of the project devs about it and he told that he\u2019d look into it. About a week later, I got an email from a recruiter saying they\u2019d like to interview me for the internship. Yay!\n\nWell, that did sound awesome, I hopped into the opportunity and did some reading, sharpening that blade. I had 3 really interesting interviews and after quite a long wait I got an email which basically said that they\u2019d like to move with another candidate mostly because he had more experience and I still had a year of university to learn from(o_O).\n\nSo, basically after this I was quite sad and felt really bad. I for one thought a lot about this and there were the times when I thought maybe I was not good at all. This brought me to think about some of my open source contributions as well. I used to contribute to open source mostly because I was learning a lot and learned a lot about good code, code review, processes and approach to some serious problems. But, with of all of this it also felt like why was I even contributing to a project where I was not even worth it. Sadly, I do feel that at times, but I like it when I learn.\n\nI know recruiting is a tough work and there are some tough and quick decisions to make because of which a lot of factors come into play like where one comes from, where one is currently located, one\u2019s name and lots of other tiny details. I dont say its intentional but everyone is judgemental when you have to make a decision. That is why I know lots of amazing people back in India and Nepal who have been rejected who I think are among the A grade talent and lots of people would agree to me. Maybe there\u2019s a problem, one that seriously needs to be solved. But yes, this doesn\u2019t change the fact that I may be useless as well (lets hope I\u2019m not).\n\nWell, I have been conspirating on some secret schemes with a bunch of amazing people and I must say, I am enjoying it. Regarding contributing to mozilla, I would be (as a developer)inactive for a while, for sure, maybe a lot more. But I am still the guy who contributes to the open web and loves to see the web crossing it boundaries."}

It was a great hike with a nice weather accompanied with some beautiful landscapes. Perfect recipe for a good hike.\n\nLike every other hikes, this one also helped me think deeply and contemplate about a number of things. Among them, most of my energy was spent on thinking about the hike itself.\n\nMost of it was directed towards how can we use Hike for Nepal to create some positive impact, possibly in the hiking location, during the hike. How can we bring some positive change, slowly and steadily.\n\nOne of the things that I noticed, the hike was full of well educated Nepalese who were decently well off (approximately 1 out of 5 had a DSLR, everyone had a pretty good camera phone). This was a great group of people, possibly a specific group that could do a lot for the community. Another topic that bugged me considerably during the hike was all the plastic packaging that was littered over the place. It was sad, how ignorant we have been towards our environment. From Wai-Wai packets to empty bottles everywhere. The first thing that we could definitely do to fight this is by cleaning the mountains and hills during our hikes. I did my part during the hike and we did something similar in one of our hikes in the Bavarian Alps.\n\nThe question that I would like to ask is, how can we scale this idea of cleaning the mountains during our hike? How do we scale it from one person to the whole group. The biggest benefit of this would be that hikers would learn to clean the mountains and take back their own garbage with them. Thus, ensuring the mountains to be clean, the nature to be serene and experiences to be breathtaking.\n\nFinally, I would like to remind one of the rules from the Golden Rules for Living\n\nIf you open it, close it.\nIf you turn it on, turn it off.\nIf you unlock it, lock it up.\nIf you break it, admit it.\nIf you can\u2019t fix it, call in someone who can.\nIf you borrow it, return it.\nIf you value it, take care of it.\n\nIf you move it, put it back.\nIf it belongs to someone else and you want to use it, get permission.\nIf you don\u2019t know how to operate it, leave it alone.\nIf it\u2019s none of your business, don\u2019t ask questions.\nIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it.\nIf it will brighten someone\u2019s day, say it.\nIf it will tarnish someone\u2019s reputation, keep it to yourself.\n\u2014 Found somewhere in the vast vast internet, Source unknown"}
{"url": "https://avinash.com.np/2015/11/22/on-forgiveness/", "origin": "https://avinash.com.np/", "title": "On Forgiveness", "content": "What do you think is the right course of action, bringing justice by punishment or forgiving the wrongdoer? Fighting the fight for ego or forgiving? These are tough discussions to have and there is enough philosophical evidence to justify either side of the argument. I have come to believe that there is no \u201cright-way\u201d or \u201cthe recipe\u201d that one can follow, one must always think about the implications, the stakeholders involved and the bigger picture and take the righteous action. Even though there is no golden rule there are set of doctrines and frameworks one can follow that is considered to be on a higher moral ground.\n\nMost of the times when we are thinking of forgiveness, the alternate course of action is radical, extreme, one that we consider not ourselves. The reason to be in such a state is generally because our pride has been touched, the ego has been hurt and betrayal has been committed.\n\n.. the same dualism underlies the nature and condition of man. Every excess causes a defect; every defect an excess. Every sweet hath its sour; every evil its good. Every faculty which is a receiver of pleasure has an equal penalty put on its abuse. It is to answer for its moderation with its life. For every grain of wit there is a grain of folly\u2026\n\nEmerson has very nicely said that the world is an equation and everything that is done will have a reaction. If that\u2019s the case then does it not make sense to follow the path of peace and let nature do its job. Why should we take part in the wrongdoing? Because we want to satisfy our ego, want our pride back. What guarantee is there that the pride is restored after the action? None. Maybe it is better to live without pride, without happiness. Being neutral in every sense. Every happiness will have its sadness.\n\nNo man had ever a point of pride that was not injurious to him.\n\nSimilar was the situation of Yudhishthir in Mahabharat when he was persuaded by his wife and brothers to go to war and fight against Duryodhan. This was during their time in exile. His response was that its harder to give forgiveness, it takes more energy to forgive.\n\nForgiveness is the strength of the virtuous. To fight is easy, but to forgive is difficult. To be patient is not to be weak; to seek peace is always the wiser course.\n\nThe epic has it that they went to war, the great battle of kurukshetra took place and after numerous tricks and deceits of Krishna (the charioteer and God) they win the war, they get their kingdom back. At this point of time Yudhishthir doesn\u2019t have pride in winning the war, is not content to have his kingdom back. On the contrary, he is sad, in remorse, in pain, thinking about all the deaths of his teacher, his brothers, his men.\n\nTo get a piece of the earth we totally abandoned men who were equal to the earth, men whom we should never have killed. And now we live with our kinsmen dead and our wealth exhausted\u2026 like dogs we greedily went after a piece of meat! Now our piece of meat is gone, and so are those who would have eaten it. The heroes are dead. The evil is done. Our kindgom has been laid waste. Having killed them, our rage is gone. Now this grief holds me in check!\nExcerpts from Mahabharat -\n\n(The difficulty of being Good)\n\nOne might argue if the path of forgiveness is always the higher moral ground, wouldn\u2019t the world be unfair. What would have happened to slavery in America? what would happen to Indians under the British Raaj ? What would have happened to Jews during WWII ? These are all valid questions and it does seem like forgiveness has a conflict with Justice in a larger sense.\n\nOne way to look at it is by weighing the deeds. Some deeds have so much evil, there is so much bad into it that it is beyond forgiveness or the psychological burden of forgiveness is too high to be granted. This does mean that its not our strength at display but our weakness at display in this case. In Mahabharat, Yudhishthir before going to war, justifies it as his duty and an act he must do even though he doesn\u2019t like it. Maybe the idea is to look at the bigger good and act accordingly. These are nevertheless really tough decisions to make and maybe your duty is what can justify the course of action. Maybe that is how Jack Dorsey would also justify\n\n.\n\nThese are very tough topics to think about and to come to a worthy conclusion. All I can say and suggest is to think of the possibilities, weight all the options, see the impact and then eventually\n\n. One fun learning I\u2019ve had is that, it is much easier to write on this topic than to have a contextual discussion."}

Nothing has changed in the once peaceful country. That peaceful country where people are fighting; They are divided, divided by caste, divided by religion, divided by color, divided by reason, divided without any reason. Fight all day long, fight for your ego, fight for the fake pride and then in the end of the day take pride in being the most peaceful country in the world, take pride in being the most peaceful people, take pride in coming from the land of Buddha. Great, at least we are the quintessential hypocrites.\n\nIt\u2019s sad to see the leaders fighting like children. Oh come on, we had fairer fights when we were kids. It\u2019s funny to see the parties organize a meeting with the other parties, and follow it with their own personal meetings; its clear they have no philosophy, no pride, no compassion, all they want is to maximize their profits. This child play has been the norm in one way; it has pulled everyone centuries behind. Centuries behind in thinking, in science, in contribution to society.\n\nThe smart world is working on nurturing the future generation. We? we have already lost them, we have failed them. Those kids should be studying in school, challenging their teachers, learning from their mentors, painting, drawing and solving that random equation. But, NO! They are everywhere but not where they should be. They are sitting in home playing, they are working in that brick factory where they legally shouldn\u2019t be, and they are lying on that corner of the street burning grass. But then, how could they go to school? The teachers are not motivated to teach the students; In most cases, they are there because that is the last job they could find, one that pays the least and our society has accepted it that way. Why? Simply because they are not a part of the vicious romantic consumerism cycle. If only they could produce something that could be exchanged with money. All they are doing is building the future, adding some fine touches to it, how can that be important? No gains at all!\n\nThe situation is saddening, and its getting worse day by day. Every day a political party is angry, the schools are closed! a wife and a husband have a fight, the schools are closed. I am sure this situation frustrates many more and I am aware that there are wiser beings that are working on fixing this, trying to be a part of the solution. Not rant like me by making a fuss of the problem. I think there is only one right way to solve this problem and its not a quick one, its one that takes its time but does the job. We have to change our culture, our society, our views. Education has to be taken seriously. We have to build better schools, develop infrastructure. Not schools that are money making machines, but schools that are shaping better humans and better futures. Invest the money a school generates into the teachers, into other schools. Build standards, standards that schools have to be built up to. The government has to play an active role in this, the political parties have to play an active role in this, we the citizens have a bigger role to play in this. Government schools have to rise, rise to standards that set benchmarks. The system has to invest into the future, the future that will build the system in return."}

This was a two day event completely focused on developing web applications which would also work on Firefox OS.\n\n###Day 1\nThe first day of the event was aimed at giving the audience an idea of mozilla, the mozilla community and Firefox OS, ofcourse. Vineel started by talking about mozilla and the community, Sayak continued by introducing the idea of Firefox OS and why it was required, Soumya then took on the stage and discussed some technical details about the platform and eventually Robin, Sayak, Biraj and me gave some demos on firefox OS application and the process of writing a basic \u201chello world\u201d application. The talks went pretty well but one thing that struck me was the audience. This was a very different audience, compared to other events because they were paying attention, asking questions, interacting and were actually making sense. Believe me, this rarely happens in an engineering college in India :D.\n\n###Day 2\nThe second day was roughly divided into two parts, the hackaton and the presentations. The hackathon went pretty well and most of the attendees got a taste of, how easy it was to make an application for firefox OS using open web technologies. It was amazing to see about 30 applications being presented at the end of the day. I guess, we can say it was a win!\n\nThat was all about the event. I would like to thank the FORMAT Team, especially Avik, Gaurab and Subhashish for the warm reception and managing the event in such a professional manner. Last but not the least, I got to learn a lot from Biraj, Vineel, Soumya, Robin and Sayak."}

It\u2019s 9:15am and Ravi dai, our MC for the day kicks off the show. Each talk was interesting and gave enough to the audience.

Finally, the venue opens up, we fill our bottles, get an initial briefing about the hike, get into our Sajha bus and off we go.\n\nWe reach Lakhuri Bhanjyang and Kailash from artudio gives an amazing introduction to art. He explains how you can do art with anything and it likes in the eyes of the maker. We then divide into groups based on our tshirt color -\n\n. The whole hike we used materials from nature to build small art pieces. It was the best exercise to get to know other people from our groups.\n\nThe main motive of the hike was for the attendees, speakers and organizers to mingle more and get to network at a more deeper level. I think that\u2019s what exactly happened as I got to talk to so many people and know what they were doing, get an understanding of their point of view and have deeper conversations about tech, life, community and nature.\n\nApart from the main conference and hike, some of the speakers and attendees took the opportunity to do other activities. Some of the highlights are:\n\nThere will definitely be a next wwktm. In what capacity, design, format? That is a thought for another blog post.\n\nUntil then,\n\nBe nice to everyone :D"}

In some cases I have also added the reasoning or the idea that is being sent across by the text or just notest that made sense to accompany them. I am still reading the whole essay and will at one point write my thoughts and views on it (maybe).\n\nThe essay mostly talks about why its important to know thyself; why knowing yourself and accepting your thoughts might be tough. The following part of the text talks about the times when one was not courageous enough to speak their heart or do what they heeded to do, and later realized that someone else said/did it and got all the glory (though some parts of the text also deals with why getting the glory, or working to get the glory is not important at all)\n\nA man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within, more than the lustre of the firmament of bards and sages. Yet he dismisses without notice his thought, because it is his. In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts: they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.\n\n.. Else, to-morrow a stranger will say with masterly good sense precisely what we have thought and felt all the time, and we shall be forced to take with shame our own opinion from another.\n\nThis part of the essay deals with one having to do something that they don\u2019t like, but are doing it just because it made sense at one point of time and they don\u2019t want to contradict themselves. It somehow goes into the lines of\n\nwhere one has the mental stress or discomfort because of contradictory beliefs in their mind and are motivated to reduce this dissonance (Based on the definition from wikipedia)\n\nThe other terror that scares us from self-trust is our consistency; a reverence for our past act or word, because the eyes of others have no other data for computing our orbit than our past acts, and we are loath to disappoint them.\n\nBut why should you keep your head over your shoulder? Why drag about this corpse of your memory, lest you contradict somewhat you have stated in this or that public place? Suppose you should contradict yourself; what then? It seems to be a rule of wisdom never to rely on your memory alone, scarcely even in acts of pure memory, but to bring the past for judgment into the thousand-eyed present, and live ever in a new day. In your metaphysics you have denied personality to the Deity: yet when the devout motions of the soul come, yield to them heart and life, though they should clothe God with shape and color. Leave your theory, as Joseph his coat in the hand of the harlot, and flee.\n\nWith consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words, and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said to-day. \u2014 \u2018Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood.\u2019 \u2014 Is it so bad, then, to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh.\n\nThe following paragraph tries to talk about the moment, and how one should live in the present and not sulk in the past or worry about the future. It is somehow way more philosophical compared to the rest of the text till this part. Similar ideas have been mentioned in Buddhist texts that talk about mindfulness and being available for the moment rathar than being in a different point of time.\n\nMan is timid and apologetic; he is no longer upright; he dares not say \u2018I think,\u2019 \u2018I am,\u2019 but quotes some saint or sage. He is ashamed before the blade of grass or the blowing rose. These roses under my window make no reference to former roses or to better ones; they are for what they are; they exist with God to-day. There is no time to them. There is simply the rose; it is perfect in every moment of its existence. Before a leaf-bud has burst, its whole life acts; in the full-blown flower there is no more; in the leafless root there is no less. Its nature is satisfied, and it satisfies nature, in all moments alike. But man postpones or remembers; he does not live in the present, but with reverted eye laments the past, or, heedless of the riches that surround him, stands on tiptoe to foresee the future. He cannot be happy and strong until he too lives with nature in the present, above time.\n\nOn failure, and pressures from the society and believing in yourself.\n\nIf our young men miscarry in their first enterprises, they lose all heart. If the young merchant fails, men say he is ruined. If the finest genius studies at one of our colleges, and is not installed in an office within one year afterwards in the cities or suburbs of Boston or New York, it seems to his friends and to himself that he is right in being disheartened, and in complaining the rest of his life. A sturdy lad from New Hampshire or Vermont, who in turn tries all the professions, who teams it, farms it, peddles, keeps a school, preaches, edits a newspaper, goes to Congress, buys a township, and so forth, in successive years, and always, like a cat, falls on his feet, is worth a hundred of these city dolls. He walks abreast with his days, and feels no shame in not \u2018studying a profession,\u2019 for he does not postpone his life, but lives already. He has not one chance, but a hundred chances. Let a Stoic open the resources of man, and tell men they are not leaning willows, but can and must detach themselves; that with the exercise of self-trust, new powers shall appear; that a man is the word made flesh, born to shed healing to the nations, that he should be ashamed of our compassion, and that the moment he acts from himself, tossing the laws, the books, idolatries, and customs out of the window, we pity him no more, but thank and revere him, and that teacher shall restore the life of man to splendor, and make his name dear to all history.\n\nTo the end of the essay, the author talks about the\n\n. To begin with, I had a totally different view on travelling, like the \u201chow it changes you\u201d and \u201cyou discover yourself\u201d view that the world has, but since the last\n\n\u2044\n\nmonths, I have come to realise that travelling is just a concept that has come from romantic consumerism. Author\n\nbriefly talks about it in his book\n\nas well. Nevertheless, this is a different view on the same thing and was quite interesting to read, since it is dated from the 19th century.\n\nTravelling is a fool\u2019s paradise. Our first journeys discover to us the indifference of places. At home I dream that at Naples, at Rome, I can be intoxicated with beauty, and lose my sadness. I pack my trunk, embrace my friends, embark on the sea, and at last wake up in Naples, and there beside me is the stern fact, the sad self, unrelenting, identical, that I fled from. I seek the Vatican, and the palaces. I affect to be intoxicated with sights and suggestions, but I am not intoxicated. My giant goes with me wherever I go.\n\nTo wrap things up,\nA quote from the book Khushi by Vijay Kumar (\u0916\u0941\u0938\u0940 - \u0935\u093f\u091c\u092f \u0915\u0941\u092e\u093e\u0930 ) is very apt to this topic:\n\n\u0905\u093e\u092b\u0942\u0932\u093e\u0908 \u0905\u093e\u092b\u0948\u0901 \u092a\u0930\u093f\u092d\u093e\u0937\u093f\u0924 \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0928\u0901 \u092d\u0928\u0947 \u0905\u0930\u0941\u0932\u0947 \u092e\u0932\u093e\u0908 \u0924\u093f\u0928\u0915\u0948 \u0938\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0926\u0905\u0928\u0941\u0938\u093e\u0930 \u092a\u0930\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0930 \u092c\u0928\u093e\u090f\u0930 \u0916\u093e\u0928\u0947\u091b\u0928\u094d \u0964\n\u2013 \u0932\u094b\u0930\u094d\u0921\u0947\n> If I don\u2019t define myself others will make a dish of me based on their taste and eat.\n\nPS: still reading and will be adding stuff"}

The only way we can make a difference is by being aware of our choices. I find it funny that we have to pay a premium for \u201cfair-trade\u201d and are very comfortable with the default. Shouldn\u2019t it be the other way round, that all products are \u201cfair-trade\u201d by default and the products that have had unfair procedures would be labeled as \u201cunfair-trade\u201d. I guess, that would be a good behavioral hack.\n\nThese are just some of my thoughts about consumerism. I like the idea of the\n\n, pushing us to be better humans, to be a better part of the society, be more aware of the world and our impact to it and taking a step by being the change we want to see. Remember,\n\n\u201cIt is easier to fight for one\u2019s principles than to live up to them.\u201d\n\nSo, live up to your principles. Make sure you have some, if not, I think ^^ (up there) is a good starting point :) ."}

It all started back in mid-2013 when my twitter stream and facebook newsfeed was filled with status-es like \u201cIt\u2019s official, you\u2019re invited! Yay!\u201d and there in my mailbox was an unread email with the same subject. Yes, It was official and I was invited too :D. It was an invitation to attend the Mozilla Summit 2013 to be hosted simulatneously in 3 cities (Brussels, Toronto and Santa-Clara) and with the mission for (almost) all mozillians to come together, get inspired, talk and shape the future of the open web.\n\nFast forward to October 2013, after a flight from Munich via Amsterdam, I was standing in front of the Brussles airport, there were the amazing summit volunteers waiting to greet mozillians and make sure we reach the right hotel. I checked into the hotel, went to the square to grab dinner/snacks and the awesome goodie bag. Next stop was the Delirium Cafe (also known for having the guiness world record for the most variety of beer in 2004) where i met a lot of awesome mozillians.\n\nOver the next couple(+1) of days i attended sessions related to privacy on the web (where we discussed about ghostery and collusion- now knows as Lightbeam), using the developer tools to debug other XUL based applications (especially thunderbird), Mozilla Reps program, MDN, OpenBadges, having a million mozillians. One thing that i liked about each session is that it was a two way session and it included more discussions and less of one way communication.\n\nOther than the sessions, I think the world fair and the innovation fair were the two awesome places to be in the summit as it gave one an opportunity to see how spread we are as mozillians and how awesome we are too.\n\nWell, you attended an event - AWESOME, but what you take away from the event decides how successful it was and how it would help you in the coming days. Here\u2019s what i got to takeaway.\n - Getting to know some of the faces behing the IRC nicks, turns out i couldnt\u2019 meet all the faces\n - Meeting the mozillians from Europe. I would like to give a special shout out to Axel Grude (the awesome AMO guru), Raivis (The Latvian mozillian, localizer, webdev, awesome!), Rimas (localizer, techie from Lithuania) and Sjmur (Mozilla ireland community manager).\n - A week after the summit and i had already helped Axel test(and find a bug too) one of his\n\nand made it to his contributor list.\n - Last but not the least, leaving with the motivation to do more and the feeling that your work is making a difference.\n\nAnother mail, another set of flights and here I am in London, Running to the Mozilla office directly from the airport to attend a reps meeting session regarding the Mozilla Festival. Oh, did i say that this was the biggest MozFest till date. This was quite a different event from other Mozilla events, because of the new set of audience and the new set of motivation. The Mozilla Festival is all about building and hacking, as they say (F*ck it, Ship it).\n\nThe first day of the event officially started with the science fair at the evening, leaving us (as facilitators) a whole day to get an idea of the flow of the event and our role in it. Me and Prashish were part a of the scrum led by Kat and Laura, where we had a wall full of problems and an army of awesome-scurm-leads (More on the scrum later). Then we had the hack-your-tshirt session where we hacked our tshirts with spray paint and sketch-pens. The event had a mega version of it with paints and what not (more on that later). Then, kicked off the real deal of the day, the Science festival. There were some awesome projects, experiments and products being displayed but i would like to give a special mention to goolabs (for their awesome work with 3d on the web), Erase all kittens(for how awesome+weird+different their approach to teaching and gaming is) and the tactile web demo from the Mozilla Japan team (believe me they were awesome)\n\nThe Day 2 kicked off with the keynotes and then moving to the track they belonged to. I first went to the #teachTheWeb track, as we were part of that track. There was a beautiful wall of\n\nwaiting to be in the making and be made eventually :D . Then i went to the openbadges section to hack on some custom badges and badges of the future. While browsing other badges i was way inspired by the\n\n. Then came the most important and happening event of the day, the Maker-Party. I am so glad that i didnt miss it, because the aurora and the spirit at the maker party was amazing (more than that). People working on stop-motion-videos, children learning to code, people making games using scratch, making (the so sweet)kumi dolls, and a lot more (there were so many things happening that i might have forgot some). That was most of the first day which ended with some awesome conversations with Henrik, Jan, Prashishh, Michael and Leo over the course of Japanese food.\n\nThe third day was mostly similar with attending more awesome sessions, meeting more awesome people, painting some more t-shirts :P and learning more intriguing ways to teach and engage people.\n\nI think the biggest takeaway from this event was how important learning is and how big a role the teacher/teaching method plays in the process. I personally learned a variety of different ways people were using to teach webmaking and moreover dozens of ways people were using the web to make things. Again, a big shout out to all the Mozilla Reps (you all are awesome), It was a great pleasure meeting each one of you.\n\nWell, I wanted to especially thank the Mozilla Nepal community (especially Avash for taking the lead initially), and the people behind the first Mozilla South Asian Meetup, where i got to meet all the community leaders (especially Deb, who is my mentor too) who eventually guided me and helped me to contribute."}

My method of reading the book has been rather unmethodical. Every couple of days/weeks when I feel like it, I pick up the book and continue reading where i last left off. Sometimes when I come across a strong thought (which happens more often than not in this book), I keep that thought in my mind and try to put it into action over time.\n\nThe following excerpt from the book has had a huge impact on me. I think about it very often and it reminds me of other quotes and sayings that I keep close to myself (and have collected mentally over the years)\n\nLiving life as an artist is a practice.\nYou are either engaging in the practice or you\u2019re not.\n\nIt makes no sense to say you\u2019re not good at it\nIt\u2019s like saying, \u201cI\u2019m not good at beting a monk.\u201d\nYou are either living as a monk or you\u2019re not.\n\nWe tend to think of the artist\u2019s work as the output.\n\nThe real work of the artist is a way of being in the world.\n\nThere is another quote from the Psychologist Alfred Adler that I heard back in 2015 and It has impacted the way I act on this very much. The quote goes as follows\n\n\u201cIt is easier to fight for ones principles than to live up to them.\u201d.\n\nSuch a strong statement. We all have principles, and there are principles that we very often are very strict about in \u201cwords\u201d and stricter when we see other people going against it. But, when it comes to us living by those principles, we very easily defy them and create loopholes for our own convenience. The way this has impacted my is as follows \u2013 In most cases before acting and saying things to people, I think if they are pragmatic or rather principle based. If they are principle based, I tend to not speak them as often as I would in past. These are my principles and as long as someone else is not crossing boundaries, I would allow them to live by theirs and I\u2019d \u201ctry\u201d to live by mine. I don\u2019t want to spend my time \u201cfighting\u201d for my principles. Atleast, I am not here to spread it, I think.\n\nThere is one more quote along similar lines as Rick Rubin. It\u2019s from \u201cThe Tibetian book of living and dying\u201d by Sogyal Rinpoche. I unfortunately don\u2019t recall the exact words from the book, and don\u2019t have a copy to get it from. But, the feeling of the words remain with me \u2013\n\nYou cannot meditate for some time and then be not meditating. That is not how meditation works. Meditation is a way of life.\n\nSpeaking for myself, I tend to think a lot about my principles and topics that I am interested in. And based on that, I try to live my life focusing on those topics, learning about them, acting as I belong to learn about those topics and create something with them. Its not important if the creation changes the world. Its not important if the creation is well known in the world. The only thing that is important is that it changes me. And, it changes me for good. I hope."}

Its raining cats and dogs. Actually, It\u2019s been raining non stop for the last 2 nights. The streets are flooded and the very little traffic that is out this stormy morning is being re-routed in multiple places. I am wondering how today will go.\n\n-\nSeveral of the organizing team reach the venue. We are setting up the venue, but there is a cloud of uncertainity. The rain is not something that we had factored in our planning.\n\n-\nI get a message \u201cAvinash, I believe you should consider cancelling today.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a thought that has already cross our minds. There\u2019s news of flood in several locations of Kathmandu. Several landslides have been reported. But we also had a commitment to everyone who registered. Even if just five people showed up, we felt we owed it to them to keep the show running. And that\u2019s exactly what we were going to do.\n\n- The first group of attendees show up. We were not expecting people to show up on time, let alone at all. This was the first motivation we needed for the day.\n\n-  A few more trickled in, and by now we had around 40 people. Not bad, right? Enough for a party. A BarCamp Party.\n\nBy the end of the day we had:\n\nSome fun facts:\n\nAll in all, I am really happy with the event and how it turned out. We (as wwktm) haven\u2019t had organized an event since covid, so getting back on the \u201corganizing\u201d wheel took quite a lot of effort, But in the end, I think we pulled it off.\n\nFor next time, though, if there\u2019s a BarCamp again [1], we\u2019ll definitely plan earlier and budget better. The ticket prices were kept low this time, and unfortunately, we ended up with a few financial losses. But I\u2019d like to think of it as an investment in future events rather than a loss.\n\n[1] Let me know what you thought about the event. Your feedback helps us improve and motivates us to keep going.\n\nUntil then,\n\nBe nice to everyone :D"}

It fills me with pride looking at how far we have come, and how colorful and eventful (ba-dum-tiss) the community has become. There is an event every week or so, community-leaders are meeting often discussing about maximizing community interaction. The best part of it is that the community also feels that we need to have such events. Now, that\u2019s all Roses, lets talk about the Thorns. I would like to disucss a Thorn in specific.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t even been a week in 2017 and I have had two event invites. YAY! that\u2019s so awesome, right? NO! Why? you may ask. The reason is that I couldn\u2019t attend either of the two events. People were notified a couple of days in advance about the event. I\u2019m really sorry to put this out, even though it should have been obvious, two days prior notice for a meeting/event  is too less of a time. Inviting the community atleast one week in advance should be part of the event etiquette recipe. We are failing at this. It is a collective failure and we should try to fix this.\n\nSo, what can we do about this? I have a proposition especially for dev/tech events.\n\nIf there is a better way of doing this, I am all ears, lets talk in the slack channel."}
{"url": "https://chsmc.org/2023/03/weblogs-as-a-form/", "origin": "https://chasem.co/thoughts/", "title": "How blogs shaped the web | Chase McCoy", "content": "I have a lot of nostalgia for the era of blogging that I grew up with during the first decade or so of the 2000s.\n\nOf course there was a ton of great content about technology and internet culture, but more importantly to me it was a time of great commentary and experimentation on the form of blogging and publishing.\n\nAs social media and smartphones were weaving their ways into our lives, there was a group of bloggers constructing their own worlds. Before Twitter apps and podcast clients became the UI playgrounds of most designers, it was personal sites and weblogs that were pioneering the medium.\n\nLooking back, this is probably where my meta-fascination with the web came from. For me the most interesting part has always been the part analyzing and discussing itself.\n\nRobin Sloan puts it well (as he is wont to do):\n\nBack in the 2000s, a lot of blogs were about blogs, about blogging. If that sounds exhaustingly meta, well, yes\u200a\u2014\u200abut it was also SUPER generative. When the thing can describe itself, when it becomes the natural place to discuss and debate itself, I\u00a0am telling you: some flywheel gets spinning, and powerful things start to\u00a0happen.\n\nDesign, programming, and writing started for me on the web. I can recall the progression from a plain text editor to the Tumblr theme editor to learning self-hosted WordPress.\n\nAll of that was driven by the desire to tinker and experiment with the web\u2019s form. How many ways could you design a simple weblog? What different formats were possible that no one had imagined before?\n\nEarlier this week I listened to\n\nand was delighted to hear them discuss this very topic. Jason is one of the original innovators of the blog form, and I\u2019ve been following his blog, kottke.org, since I was old enough to care about random shit on the internet.\n\n, and Jason has been publishing online for even longer than that. All along the way, he has experimented with the form of content on the web. He\u2019s not alone in that\u2014many bloggers like him have helped to mold the internet into what it is today. The ones that influenced me besides kottke.org are\n\n,\n\n, Jim Coudal and\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n, and more that I\u2019m certainly forgetting.\n\n, and my personal favorite design of the site over the years\n\nJason and John have an interesting conversation during the podcast (starting around 25 minutes in) about how the first few generations of bloggers on the web defined its shape. Moving from print to digital mediums afforded a labyrinth of new avenues to explore.\n\nIt\u2019s always important to remind ourselves that many of the things we take for granted today on the web and in digital design had to be invented by someone.\n\nEarly weblogs did not immediately arrive at the conclusion of chronological streams\u2014some broke content up into \u201cissues\u201d, some simply changed the content of their homepages entirely.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until later that the reverse-chronological, paginated-or-endless scrolling list of entries was introduced and eventually became the de-facto presentation of content on the web. That standard lives on today in the design of Twitter, Instagram, etc., and it\u2019s fascinating to see that tradition fading away as more sites embrace algorithmic feeds.\n\nBy the way, I\u2019d be remiss here if I didn\u2019t mention Amy Hoy\u2019s amazing piece\n\n. Comparing the title of her piece with the title of this one, it\u2019s clear that not everyone sees this shift in form as a positive one, but she does a great job in outlining the history and the role that blogs played in shaping the form of the web. Her particular focus on early content management systems like Movable Type is fascinating.\n\nAnother great example that Jason and John discuss on the podcast is the idea of titling blog posts.\n\nThey point out that many early sites didn\u2019t use titles for blog posts, a pattern which resembles the future form of Tweets, Facebook posts, text messages, and more. But the rise of RSS readers, many of which made the assumption that entries have titles and design their UIs around that, forced many bloggers to add titles to their posts to work well in the environment so popular with their readers.\n\nJason mentions that this was one of the driving factor for kottke.org to start adding titles to posts!\n\nThis is an incredible example of the medium shaping the message, where the UI design of RSS readers heavily influenced the form of content being published. When optimizing for the web, those early bloggers and the social networks of today both arrived at the same conclusion\u2014titles are unnecessary and add an undue burden to publishing content.\n\nThis difference is the very reason why sending an email feels heavier than sending a tweet. Bloggers not using titles on their blog posts figured out tweeting long before Twitter did.\n\nWhen referring to the early bloggers at suck.com, Jason said something that I think describes this entire revolution pretty well.\n\n[\u2026]there was in information to be gotten from not only what they linked to, but how they linked to it, which word they decided to make the hyperlink.\n\nIt\u2019s not often that you have an entirely new stylistic primitive added to your writing toolbox. For decades you could bold, italicize, underline, uppercase, footnote, etc. and all of a sudden something entirely new\u2014the hyperlink.\n\nWith linking out to other sites being such a core part of blogging, it\u2019s no surprise that the interaction design of linking was largely discussed and experimented with.\n\ndiscussing all the ways that various blogs of the time handled posts primary geared towards linking to and commenting on other sites.\n\nAnother similar example is URL slugs\u2014the short string of text at the end of a web address identifying a single post. For many of my favorite bloggers, the URL slug is a small but subtle way to convey a message that may\n\nthe same as the message of the post itself. One other stylistic primitive unique to the web.\n\nThe different ways in which bloggers designed their site or linked to words became a part of their unique style, and it gave their each of them an entirely new way to express themselves.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to communicate how grateful I feel for this era of experimentation on the web, and specifically for Jason Kottke\u2019s influence on me as a designer. The past 25 years have been a special time to experience the internet.\n\nThere was a time when I thought my career might be curved towards blogging full-time and running my own version of something like kottke.org. Through exploring that I found my way to what I really loved\u2014design and software. My work continues to benefit from what I learned studying bloggers and publishers online.\n\nWhether you care much about writing or not, I encourage you to have a blog. Write about what interests you, take great care of how you present it to the world, and you might be surprised where it takes you. There are new forms around every corner."}

I\u2019ve returned from holiday travels and am settling back into work for 2025. Here are three, quick, bookish recommendations from links that have crossed my desk recently.\n\nFirst, a newsletter: Katie Clapham\u2019s\n\nis a new favorite of mine.\n\nKatie runs an independent bookshop in Lancashire, and every Friday when she opens the shop she also starts a new draft of the newsletter. Throughout the day she fills it up with commentary on running a bookshop in these modern times, quips from the shoppers, witty observations, a record of books sold and purchased, etc. At the end of the day, she closes the shop and sends the newsletter.\n\nOne of my favorite genres of art is \u201ctotally mundane but fascinating and engaging for reasons that are hard to explain,\u201d and Receipt from the Bookshop fits that bill perfectly.\n\nMore than just being fascinating, though, it\u2019s a good reminder for us all how creativity and fulfillment as a writer\n\ncome from mundanity. There is beauty in the mundane! We can find it if we look hard enough.\n\nWhatever this is: more of it please.\n\nBooks are powerful cultural artifacts, and so much of human history is wound around them. It should be no surprise then that notebooks carry a similar significance.\n\nWell that\u2019s just what Roland Allen\u2019s book,\n\n, is all about. I picked it up recently after seeing it recommended by a few folks in their 2024 reading recaps.\n\nThe cast of historical characters that pop up throughout the book is a lot of fun, and the author does a great job of showing just how critical notebooks were to the development of civilization and culture as we know it today.\n\nAnother truly great example of something unassuming (notebooks) being explored with a contagious enthusiasm. There is, repeatedly, poetry in the mundane.\n\nBy the way, I love reading books which tell history non-linearly through the lens of ultra-niche subtopics. Another great example that comes to mind is\n\nby James Crawford. Books and buildings both make great portals back in time.\n\nFinally, a celebration of the book collectors, dealers, sellers, and conservators who preserve the art of books and bring the most important ones along into the future.\n\nWhile reading The Notebook: A History, I stumbled upon a 2019 documentary that resonated on the same frequency.\n\n, which (from what I can tell) has recently been made\n\n, focuses primarily on rare book dealers in New York City and their bookshops, and it\u2019s a visual feast for book lovers. But more importantly it\u2019s an homage to those still dedicating their lives to preserving the written word and the book as a form.\n\nThere\u2019s a clear and present danger to the world of books that is felt palpably in the documentary, with many sellers and collectors worried about a diminishing market for book collectors. There are also those in the film who see a bright future. It\u2019s nice to hear both takes.\n\nAs for myself, I am a huge fan of collecting physical books, and maintain a\n\nwhich you can browse if you\u2019d like. Whether you collect books or not, I recommend giving The Booksellers a watch."}

In a recent\n\n, we discussed computer science degrees, bootcamps, and self-directed learning. Each has benefits and have brought a lot of people into the world of programming. Each also has challenges. All four of us have had unique paths to programming, so here are our stories.\n\nI was a biology major in college and then quickly realized that I was terrible at it. So, I switched to actuarial science where I took an intro to computer science course and totally fell in love with binary, hexadecimal, and octal systems. The rest is really history. I studied computer science and my first language was Java. I was a little bit of a late bloomer but I thoroughly enjoy it.\n\nI got started when I was 11 years old. I wanted to build my own community on Neopets. If you\u2019re not familiar with what Neopets is, it\u2019s this Web site where you can have your own virtual pet and you can feed it and play games. You can have your own communities and all kinds of stuff.\n\nI really wanted to build my own community and customize it. But you need to know how to code to do that. So, I asked my dad for an HTML book and my first book was HTML goodies. I thought it was awesome and a lot of fun.\n\nFast forward to high school, and I took AP Computer Science. My first language in high school was Java, and I was so bad at it that I needed a tutor just to pass the class. I was like \"I\u2019m never going to do this ever.\" But, you know, obviously, 17 years later and I\u2019m very clearly still coding, so something eventually clicked but it wasn\u2019t Java.\n\nI was an admin assistant really aimlessly going through my job; I was miserable. My dad suggested coding to me and was like \"worst case scenario if you hate it you could try something else.\"\n\nSo, he bought me an \u201dIntroduction to Drupal\u201d book and \u2013 quite frankly, I do not recommend starting out as Drupal when you\u2019re learning to code but that\u2019s how I did. I just continue learning, continue working in the mornings before work. Then I got my first Drupal job.\n\nA few years into that I started learning about accessibility. Then a year or so after that I started learning about React and VueJS and I\u2019m now a React developer and the rest is kind of history.\n\nI learned to code when I was a sophomore in college. I had no idea what coding even was, but I had an extra course block available. I decided to sign up for it because people kept telling me, \u201dIt\u2019s a good thing to learn and it\u2019ll help you no matter what.\u201d\n\nI honestly thought that I was going to be learning how to format Word documents or something like that - I had no idea what code was. But, I was instead writing Python. It was super fun: we were building games. I just thought it was magical how you could put stuff together and have a program come out of it.\n\nI completely reconfigured my schedule and was like I\u2019m going to double major in computer science, this is my future. So, I started my second class which was in C++ and it was a super intense \"Data Structures and Algorithms\" class, which was also a weed out class. I was pulling all-nighters and working so hard in that class just to understand it. I did come out of it with a good grade. I thought \"if I have to work this hard for it, it means that I\u2019m not good enough at it. This is really just not for me.\"\n\nThen when I was a Junior in college I had an internship doing mostly Excel data analysis type work, and I figured out that I could automate a lot of my own job using the Python skills that I had. So, from there, I got a software engineering internship and transitioned to working full time in code.\n\nYou can listen to the\n\nwhere we discussed our thoughts on bootcamps, computer science degrees, and self-directed learning as well as advice for everyone in the midst of their journies.\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nI love origin stories!\n\nI think the major takeaway is that it doesn't matter how you get started - just get started, and keep going.  Each of your backgrounds is so different; it's a testament to the fact that there is no one 'right' way to get started.  Just find something you like doing - and keep doing that.\n\nThanks for sharing!\n\nI love hearing \"where did you fell in love with computers\" stories \ud83e\udd29\n\nKeep rocking!\n\nLoved Lindsey\u2019s story, my first job was as a Drupal developer!

{"url": "https://dev.to/aspittel/working-remote-for-those-who-struggle-with-it-4g35", "origin": "https://dev.to/aspittel", "title": "Working Remote for Those Who Struggle with It - DEV Community", "content": "Posted on\n\n\u2022 Originally published at\n\non\n\nI have been\n\nabout the fact that remote work is very difficult for me. I'm an extrovert, and the social environment at work helps to motivate me and get me through the day. That being said, due to COVID and the evolving nature of tech work, I've been working remote for almost two years. There are a lot of benefits to it, like no commute time, the ability to live wherever, more flexibility, and accessibility. Also, I know it's a huge privilege to be able to work remote during this time, and so few of my non-tech friends have that ability. But, for me, working remote doesn't come naturally. So, I wanted to write down my strategies for making it as enjoyable as possible.\n\nI also want to note before starting that right now many of us are working through the stress of a pandemic, shifting to new modalities at work, struggling with economic instability and unemployment, shifting childcare responsibilities, and dealing with health concerns for ourselves and our families. None of this is normal, make sure to take time for yourself and it's okay to not be okay.\n\nThis may sound super corny, but mentally having some sort of \"commute\" to work in the morning and after work in the evening creates some separation in your day. I have a dog, which makes this even easier -- I walk her at the beginning of the day before work and then take her to the park at the end of the day. I also have time to sneak in a bit of a podcast or an audiobook too.\n\nWhen I started working remote, I lived alone. It made work from home really hard because if I didn't actively make plans, I could go days without talking to another human. Earlier this year, I moved in with my partner. Now, I am guaranteed to talk to someone pretty much every day, and I feel much less isolated.\n\nEven if living with another person isn't a reality, having a pet really helps. Having Blair, my dog, makes me get out of the house, and I still have someone with me all day, even if she isn't human. I get cuddles during my breaks, and I even sometimes get a ball thrown at me!\n\nWhen I started working remote, I lived in an apartment that had essentially been my crash pad before. It was in a perfect location, but wasn't very large and was very old -- it didn't even have a real kitchen! I worked out of a desk in my bedroom. So, I was pretty much in that room for 22+ hours a day. It wasn't great for me mentally to not have a separate workspace, and there wasn't much separation between my work and the rest of my life. I know it isn't realistic for everyone, especially those with families or who live in cities with high rent and low square footage, but having a dedicated workspace that you can close off at the end of the day is\n\nand helps you really separate work and the rest of your life.\n\nEarlier this year when the pandemic hit, I lived in a very old studio apartment in NYC, and while it was in the perfect location, it also had a horrible mouse problem, the temperature was always off, and I was pretty much in the same room 24 hours a day. It was miserable.\n\nMoving out of that environment has made working from home much more bearable. Especially since my company has a work from home budget. Getting a comfortable chair, a monitor setup that works for me, and customizations that fit my personality make my workday so much more enjoyable. It has also become a lot more important for me to live in a nice space, and instead of prioritizing living close to work or right downtown, I'm more concerned with living somewhere that's updated, doesn't have a lot of issues, and has space to move around.\n\nEven though I think it's really helpful to have a dedicated workspace, I also move throughout my apartment throughout the day. I do a few hours of work at my desk, then take calls from the couch or the dining room table if I don't need a monitor. It's nice to change the scenery and have a different chair at some point in the day. It helps me re-focus as the day goes on.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of working in an office is the ability to grab or eat lunch with work friends each day. Something I do at least once a week is schedule a lunchtime video call with a friend, whether they are inside of my company or external. It really breaks up the day, recharges me, and keeps those connections intact.\n\nOne of the really nice parts of working remote is that other than calls, you can normally schedule your day to fit your schedule and how you work best rather than being standardized to a 9-5. I often read the advice to always get ready for work. I instead normally put on makeup and get dressed nicely mid-day when I don't have early meetings. I also sometimes take runs during my lunch break, and I often work a 7-3 or 8-4 day instead of 9-5. Use the flexibility to your advantage and work a schedule that fits your needs.\n\nThis is much less relevant now since there's a pandemic going on, but I think it's so important to still socialize with friends and do things outside of your house. It can be tempting to become a hermit since you have to actively leave your house to do things after work, but you still need social interaction and to experience life outside your living space. I find making plans with friends makes me more accountable and likely to do things. Even now, setting up virtual or park hangouts adds some variety to the day!\n\nThis is, again, more of a post-pandemic recommendation, but before COVID I used to do co-working days with friends who also work remote. I would either have them over, or we would meet at a coffee shop and we would work together on each of our work tasks. It's a great opportunity to catch up and have the opportunity to have someone to chat with throughout the day.\n\nOne of the things I miss most about working in an office is unstructured discussion time with colleagues. Most remote calls have a structure and an agenda, but so much valuable brainstorming comes from free-flowing discussions. On past teams, we've scheduled watercooler time or virtual team happy hours, and it's been great to get to know one another and come up with ideas.\n\nEven though most things are remote now, having a community who understands what you do and who you can learn from is so important. I love so many Discord and Slack groups in addition to public forums like DEV and Twitter. They allow me to stay involved with the larger developer community.\n\nRemote work is an increasing piece of work in tech, and I know that it's a really amazing thing for a lot of people, especially parents and those who are disabled. There are many nice pieces of it, like being able to live wherever, no commute times, and the flexibility. That being said, the decrease in work/life separation and the decrease in social time also makes it difficult. Also, this year we aren't just working remote, we are working during a pandemic -- and many people have additional responsibilities as a result. I hope these tips are helpful!\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nI think it's a very important article! Not everyone will be naturally prone to working remote. One thing I have been thinking about lately is how to foster a remote company culture that is actually fun to work in? Remote video calls are good but there's no substitute for face to face interactions (yet). In the remote community there's been so much focus on co-workers who don't like each other and they are forced into an office, watercooler drama, etc. but what about if the co-workers are kickass and it's a genuine fun experience to interact.\n\nalso I was wondering: how to make remote video lunches not turn into some kind of weird live ASMR session ? \ud83e\udd23\n\nYeah I guess everything has pros and cons. Personally I like remote work, even before everyone was forced to. So I already made sure my work space is very nice.\n\nI think it's important to be disciplined and be good at planning if you work from home, otherwise there is no routine and boundaries. Also, for parents I think it's extra challenge, especially if they have limited space. But perhaps WFH also allows people to move to suburb or smaller and less expensive city/town, so they can actually afford better living standard.\n\nAnyone have a link to that wallpaper \ud83d\udc40\n\nYes!\n\nThank you!! \ud83d\udc95\n\nExcellent advice. I've done a lot of these same things for most of my career (which has been 95% WFH self-employment).\n\nI will add, I suggest finding a group of friends that can do social time on video calls of some kind. I've been seriously considering an early morning \"Coffe with Seth\" type stuff to give other early birds like me someone to chit chat with about work stuff, or to just shoot the breeze at a regularly scheduled time.\n\nI've actually found myself really engaged with streamers when I never was before. That can be a lot of fun to find a small streamer and get to interact with whatever they are doing. I enjoy being helpful when I can.\n\nThanks for this post! Although I am not an extrovert, I\u2019m way on the opposite end it is important to be mindful of how we are spending our days now. It\u2019s been a real balance trying to make sure I stay healthy mentally and not fall into becoming a hermit. I have resorted to forming a pod with basically my partner and housemates and that has been super helpful to stay active.\n\nis that 13\" mac comfortable to work for you? I previously tried to work on it on a previous job, but without an external monitor it was horrible, such a small screen to work. Never considered a 16\" instead of this one? Or mobility is your top priority there?\n\nGreat post Ali\n\nThanks for this!! Having a separate place to work and pets really help\n\nYES, I agree with all those great ideas.\n\nMy FAV; Get out of the house! Feeling pent up? For people with yards or front porches, just sit outside for 5 minutes. Get that Vitamin D!\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

You will not be fully productive if you don't take breaks, don't get enough sleep, or you don't take care of yourself. I do not work all the time whatsoever. I work a very standard 40 hour work week and then do 10-20 hours of side work per week. I do not do it all, I don't work non-stop, I'm not perfect.\n\nI also have a life that allows me to dedicate a lot to my side-work. I live with just my dog, I don't have children, I've been working remote for the last year and a half, and I've been single for most of my time doing side-work. I also am at a place in my career where putting in a 40 hour workweek most weeks at my day job is sufficient. It's a huge privilege that I'm able to be in the position that I am, and I know that my life will shift a lot in the future.\n\nEarly in my career, I worked a lot more than I do now -- I don't even want to do the math on how much, but it was a lot. I didn't have much balance in my life, and I let my social media-life consume me. I wanted to do it all, which wasn't possible. I ended up getting super burnt out, anxious, and unable to be as productive as I wanted to be. Balance is\n\nimportant. I can't overstate that enough. If you're dealing with burnout,\n\nwas a super helpful read to see how bad burnout can really become and how to be more balanced.\n\nI highly prioritize time with friends and family, runs with my dog, reading non-work related books, and being a total foodie in addition to my day job and the company I run. I am more than my work, and I don't want to lose my other identities.\n\nHere are some things that I've learned that help me be my most productive. This will look different for everybody, but I hope some of this is helpful.\n\nFirst off, take care of yourself. Sleeping the optimal amount for you will make you more alert and focused throughout the day. The same thing is true for drinking enough water. I also try to eat protein, fat, and carb balanced meals frequently throughout the day. I run most days and try to do other strength-based workouts too. Plus, I take a spa night on Sundays where I do face and hair masks and teeth whitening.\n\nDon't take health advice from me -- it's not what I do. Still, I do think prioritizing your health is one of the most important things you can do for your productivity and overall well-being.\n\nAs far as scheduling goes, I live by my Google Calendars. I put everything on there - I'm the person that sends my friends GCal invites for every hangout session. Otherwise, I'll forget. It's as simple as that.\n\nI have three calendars, one for my personal life, one for We Learn Code (my company), and one for my day job. Sometimes, I'll forward events to my personal calendar, so they're all in one place. If I'm super overwhelmed, I'll calendar block everything. So, I will have every minute of my day, even free time scheduled in. I don't do this often now, but it used to be really helpful for me to see my schedule upfront.\n\nNote: this was a week where I was in between jobs and had a lot I wanted to get done. I was also on vacation for the second half of the week.\n\nIn order to prioritize what I am going to work on, I first ask myself if it's something I'm passionate about. If it is, then I think about the time commitment and what I\n\nbe able to do if I decided to take on the new task. So, if I were to pick up a new freelance client, I would have to postpone working on an ebook, for example.\n\nMy greater goals and priorities have shifted over time. I initially wanted to build a bigger audience, and the activities I took on were correlated to that. Now, my financial situation has changed a bit, and I rely on my side-work being a larger portion of my income. In the future, I may prioritize more free time, which will change things again!\n\nTo help me prioritize, I use\n\nto track my time spent on every project I do -- not just paid ones. I'm even timing myself writing this post right now. I do this so that I can see where my time goes, which inefficiencies exist, and the payoff of each activity.\n\nFor example, here's my Toggl report for the week I'm writing this. Each of my projects is color-coded, and different views show my hours worked per day and listings of each activity by time.\n\nI also ask myself, \"What are the three most important things for me to get done?\". For my side work, I have three big to-do items for the week. For my day job, I do three per day. I use a pinned Google Keep sticky to keep track of these things, and I have another sticky with any time-sensitive tasks I need to do that day. Mostly things that won't take long, but need to get done then and there. Having just a few essential things to work on helps me to stay focused. I try to only work on what I've set out to do at the beginning of the week. I'm pretty dedicated to getting these few tasks done and worry a lot less about everything else.\n\nI read the book\n\nrecently. It got pretty repetitive at some points, but it does a great job at explaining how to prioritize and why prioritization matters so much. Just do what's essential, nothing more nothing less.\n\nAlso, I do not do it all myself. If there's something that makes sense for me to have someone else do, I will hire a service to handle those tasks. I do wash and fold for my laundry, I used to hire a cleaning service for my apartment, and a large portion of my diet is take-out. I'm in a privileged position to be able to outsource some of these pieces of my life, but it allows me to do more of the work that fires me up: teaching code.\n\nMotivation is also a challenging piece of doing side work, and I'm so imperfect at always being motivated. I give myself lots of breaks, and I remind myself that this I'm choosing to do. I do have some advice for getting and staying motivated.\n\nFirst, I love having groups of friends that I \"mastermind\" with. We inspire each other with our work, commiserate over the hard parts, and discuss strategies for growth. I love working with other people, and working on projects with other people or at least talking to them about those projects is a huge source of motivation for me.\n\nI also utilize the two-minute rule -- if something takes two minutes or less, I just have to get it done. Having one thing crossed off of my to-do list starts the ball rolling, and I usually get more done.\n\nSometimes, I set a timer and timebox how long I'll spend on something -- \"I don't feel like writing right now, but if I spend five minutes on it, I'll be closer to where I want to be.\" I rarely want to stop at the end of those five minutes, but it's a great trick for getting me started on something.\n\nI also am really motivated by finishing things -- leaving them half-done really bothers me. So I usually break tasks into smaller and smaller sub-tasks and focus on completing sub-tasks. This makes me feel more accomplished and like I'm making progress, so I'll be much less likely to abandon the project.\n\nOne of the most difficult things to handle when my social media following grew was the non-stop messages. From people requesting advice to spam to lovely comments about my work, I was all the sudden getting hundreds of communications a day. I receive, on average, 100 mentions on Twitter a day, 15-20 Twitter direct messages, and 50-70 emails. It's a lot.\n\nAt first, I would respond to everything. With a lot of thought and care -- essentially writing personalized blog posts for anyone who asked me a question. It wasn't scalable. I still feel some guilt, but I don't respond to everything anymore. I have so much content that's open to the public, which scales so much better than offering 1:1 advice. I also mute my own tweets after a little while if they get a lot of attention, and I have filters so I don't get any notifications from social media. I do, however, have Tweetdeck set up to show me all mentions and quote tweets so that I can quickly mass respond to people.\n\nI also have a system for my emails. I have three folders in my inboxes: today, this week, and this month. When an email comes in, I delete it or put it in one of these folders. I respond to\n\nemails every weekday,\n\nemails on Mondays, and\n\nemails at the end of the month. I also add emails that will take some time to my to-do list so that I can allot that time better. I'm also really interested in implementing\n\nemail system down the road. It seems awesome, it just takes some time to get used to.\n\nI take notes on\n\n. I take short-term notes that I won't keep forever in\n\n. Then I can archive stickies when I'm done with them. If they're something I want long term, I take notes in markdown and upload them to GitHub. I take notes during meetings I'm in, on books I read, on courses I take, etc. It's good for learning, and it gives me a synthesized version of the material to come back to.\n\nIf I have an idea for a project or a blog post, I write that thought down, otherwise, I'll forget it. I even have a notebook next to my bed for this reason!\n\nRelated to notes, I also have checklists for everything I do -- for blog posts before I publish, for recording Egghead videos, for my morning and evening routines, etc. Making a checklist makes it so I don't have to think, I can refer to the list. I am not very detail-oriented, so having the steps for something written out is so helpful, so I don't forget anything.\n\nMy morning and evening routines are all written in large text on a\n\non my fridge -- even just brushing my teeth is on there! I have my weekly workout schedule and chores list on there too.\n\nFor large projects, I usually use Trello to stay organized and motivated. I'll have checklists for each sub-task on each card. Breaking an enormous task into smaller ones helps me keep motivated and feel like I'm making progress.\n\nI've heard great things about\n\n, a book all about keeping checklists for everything. I haven't read the full text, but reading a summary of it inspired me to start creating these checklists.\n\nIf I can convince you to do one thing after reading this article, it would be to pick up\n\n. This book changed so much for me. Instead of focusing on goals, I try and focus on building up habits that make me who I want to become.\n\nI use\n\nhabit-tracker to keep track of habits I'm trying to build. Some things I have on there include: reading a chapter of a career-focused book each day, drinking enough water, and cleaning my apartment for at least 5 minutes. There's the immediate reward of having the habit change colors after it's completed, and there's an incentive to keep the habit chain going!\n\nAs far as file management goes, I keep everything on Google Drive. That way, if my laptop dies or something, I'll still have a backup. I also only keep files I'm using frequently on my computer to keep that organized. I have folders for projects and for life stuff! I also try to keep my personal and We Learn Code drives separate. Gotta keep work/side-hustle/life balance!\n\nI also keep my browser bookmarks super organized in folders. I only keep things I need, otherwise, I'll save links elsewhere -- like Pinterest or in my notes about something. Bookmarks are for links I frequently come back to. I also have a\n\nfolder filled with articles that I want to read. I try to allocate some time to get through these from time to time too!\n\nI think the term work-life balance is imperfect, but I work to make sure that I'm not working all the time. I'm someone who very much has a tendency to work a huge number of hours and to abandon other aspects of my life and health to do more work. This isn't good, and I actively work to not do this, especially since I have been much more prone to burnout recently.\n\nFirst of all, I don't have work email or Slack on my phone. I only have them on my work computer, which I don't touch outside of work hours.\n\nI also try to make my bedroom a technology-free zone. I will say this is\n\neasier when I'm not working from home -- quarantine has made this pretty much impossible. But, I find I sleep so much better if I put my phone and my computer in my living room before I sleep. I also think having dedicated workspaces when you do work from home is so helpful, and it's something I wish that I could more fully implement in my own life (darn city rent prices!).\n\nI am someone who works best without interruption and with long blocks of time. I don't do well with random 15-minute slots to work, rather I'd prefer to have one long afternoon to work. I used to do all of my blogging from the same restaurant in DC, Busboys and Poets. I'd go there every Sunday afternoon and crank out a post. Having that routine and that long block of time was perfect for me.\n\nI also work best in the afternoon as compared to mornings or nights, though in college, late nights were my everything. I usually do side work immediately after my normal workday ends and on weekend afternoons. Everyone is going to be so different with this -- experiment and find times that work best for you!\n\nI know that the\n\ntechnique works really well for some people, but I work best in long focused blocks. I tend to follow the\n\ninstead. I take breaks when I need to or when I finish a task, but frequent breaks aren't helpful for me, nor do I need them.\n\nSometimes, I have a tendency to get distracted. Especially by social media and the internet more generally. During times like that, I'll use the\n\napp to avoid distracting sites. Sometimes I'll even shut off the internet in my apartment if I really want to get some writing done.\n\nOne additional productivity system I find super helpful is batching. Batching is when you do a bunch of similar activities at once. So, for example, when I did Instagram I would write all my captions for the month at one time, and I'd pre-create graphics and find images. Or when I'm filming videos, I'll do multiple at once. When you're in one headspace it can be optimal to keep doing similar tasks instead of changing your focus to something else.\n\nhas some excellent content on why batching is so great.\n\nMy productivity system is just that --\n\nsystem. Don't feel like you need to adopt all of this or follow any of it. I just hope it's helpful to have a peek into my life and the things that help me. Remember -- balance is\n\nimportant and looks different for everyone. I'm so far from perfect, and I think it can seem like I do so much more than I actually do on social media. I am also in a place in my life where I can spend time on side-work, and I love doing it.

I recently started using it and loved it!\n\nsomeone with my style of productivity! Techniques like Pomodoro never made sense to me; I tend to zone into an activity for hours at a time before needing a break. I've been in a quarantine-induced rut lately, so something like Toggl and the \"Flowtime\" technique should definitely help with visualizing my todos day-to-day.\n\nA lot of gems in here. Bookmarking in case I need motivation in the future \ud83d\ude01\n\nVery cool your publication. I really liked Google Keep, it will help me a lot in the division between my school studies and computer technician studies and with my remote repository on GitHub, because sometimes I get very excited, I start coding at 8 am and I stop just for lunch, so I start again and so on until 4 in the morning. I completely forget that I need to study for the entrance exam to enter a university.\n\nI like your thoughts about concentration, reminds me of\n\nprinciples you can find in Cal Newport\u2019s book. I\u2019m just\n\nabout improving as a developer, and I put a big focus on productivity, with one chapter dedicated to deep work :)\n\nGreat article! It seems that you have been working on yourself for a long time and also observing and analyzing all the records and documents too. Just a guess though! I loved many short, sweet, straight but very effective sentences like whatever you have said in the very first paragraph and in the conclusion. Thanks for sharing what has worked for you! Kudos to your efforts... Have a productive day ahead... Keep shining, Keep inspiring \ud83d\ude03\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf8a\n\nHey guys, I have been working on my very first APIs project and in that project I'm making a \"QUIZ APP\", where from an API. I have been taking 10 question and giving them multiple choices and at end they will be getting scored. I'm using NODE.JS, EXPRESS, REQUEST, EJS for the app.\n\nThe problem comes here when i get a string from API. I change it to an object using JSON.parse() and sending it to EJS files and then displayed. but when their are symbols in question like \", ' , and more they are displayed as &139; , \" like that.\n\nAlways interesting to read others' routines. I've recently added kaizen to my workflow, meaning that I look for a small step to improve a process every day. It had the most impact on my personal life so far. For example, yesterday I improved the way I prepare avocado for eating (there's a better way to deal with kernels than what I had been doing). I got the ideas from\n\n.\n\nAnother tool that I use in a similar way to the flowtime technique is RescueTime checking the report from time to time to see in which categories I was working on and how the time was spent.\n\nI have tried Pomodoro technique and I am on the same page as you that I don't need breaks too often. Will try to understand what is Flowtime, thanks for sharing this \ud83d\udc4d\n\nnote taking and scheduling has always seemed as a work itself...\n\ni guess it takes practice to implement it as a daily habit :)\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

I have no concerns over present air quality.\n\nLol, good one. Congrats by the way!\n\nHey Jason,\n\ncongrats!\n\nHow did you learn writing?\n\nI've been coming up with stories my whole life, growing up in literary circles, as my mother is an author and editor. So, as you can imagine, I read a\n\nof books, both with my mother and on my own. (I read through the complete unabridged Wizard of Oz series by myself in one summer when I was six.)\n\nI joined my first professional critique group when I was eight; I was told I'd be welcome to join, but they'd expect me to accept the same unvarnished feedback that any grown-up member would get, and to read their work and provide the same sort of honest feedback. So, I did.\n\nWhen writing professionally, you really learn that nothing you write is sacred. Even the sentence you think is the\n\nbrilliant, or the quote you think must surely be worthy of Bartlett's Quotations, might actually need to get cut from the book. Most people are okay coming up with words; the art of writing is largely in\n\nof words.\n\nFrom there, I just kept writing, participating in critique groups and countless writing workshops, and honing my craft.\n\nCongrats!!\n\nI am proud of creating JSitor, which is an alternative of JSFiddle, JSBin and CodePen.\n\nI won't say that JSitor will be the best tool but definitely it is worth to explore.

I've had scoliosis and kyphosis, and I was a year or two away from needing surgery to fix it.\n\nMy girlfriend motivated me to get a personal trainer specialized in posture, and after 7 months of regular exercises and progress tracking, I'm almost finished in fixing my posture. Exercises were simple and very effective and I didn't need to buy anything to perform them. And I also could do them at home. Each month I would get a new set of exercises targeting different areas of the body that were needed to correct the posture.\n\nSo I also want to encourage anyone else that has issues with posture to seek help and try to fix it before it gets worse. Posture exercises are great and you'll feel much better after a month or two of regular exercises.\n\nI started my\n\n24 days ago and wrote on 23 days, with only one failed day and no safety-net.\n\nI've done a blogging challenge as well!

I was at a job that wasn't the right fit for me, and I didn't know my future. I decided that rather than signing a new lease, I'd instead mostly live at tech conferences for the summer and crash at my parents' in between, and then start living out of AirBnBs in the Fall. I ended up retiring from the digital nomad lifestyle in order to work in an office gain (which started 3 days before the COVID shutdown \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f). That being said, I think this is a pretty unique experience, but more people may be able to do the same as remote work becomes more popular and (hopefully) the pandemic starts to subside. So, I wanted to write down my thoughts and advice on the experience.\n\nI personally chose to live out of AirBnBs. The longer you book a place, the more discount you get normally. So, I'd book a place for a month at a time. The cost for AirBnB pluses ended up being less than my DC rent most months. The van life idea is so appealing to me, but the mechanical knowledge needed and the potential lack of internet intimidates me. I also personally stayed in the United States because of my dog, I didn't want to quarantine her which you need to do with most international countries.\n\nI travelled from city to city in my car, which was super nice. I was able to visit a bunch of sites nearby cities instead of just staying downtown, which I may have had to without a car.\n\nI chose cities by expense, activities available, and their proximity to National Parks. My biggest bucket list item is to visit all of the National Parks, so this very much helped in that goal. I loved being able to experience different areas, taste test different restaurants, and to never get bored of my surroundings. I also was using it as a way to vet cities before settling down -- I didn't know where I wanted to move longterm, so this was a way of trying out different cities.\n\nTaxes can get\n\ncomplicated if you're moving around a bunch, especially if you move internationally or are self-employed (or just have side gigs like me). I hired an accountant who specializes in digital nomads, and it's such a weight off my chest.\n\nis his site in case you're interested.\n\nThere were two really difficult attributes of travel for me: the first was loneliness, the second was the lack of a routine. It's pretty tough to get to know people when you aren't staying in a city for long. Something I would probably prioritize if I did this again would be to go to cities with a big tech scene so I could go to meetups and potentially speak at them. I was also single at the time, so doing this with a partner or a family would probably help in that regard. As far as having a routine, I was changing where I lived every month. So it's difficult to get too settled. Part of that was nice, I would go on hikes every morning with my dog in Asheville and would go to a neighborhood coffee shop in Nashville. But, I definitely missed having a set workday schedule.\n\nOverall, it's an experience I really enjoyed and would highly recommend if your work and life situations allow it. I would probably go back to being a digital nomad once the country re-opens and my partner was able to work remote. If you're interested in moving internationally,\n\nthis Ladybug episode. Please\n\nany questions to me, I'd love to help out!\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nThis is exactly what I would like to do but kinda afraid to take the plunge. I too had a plan to visit different cities and just go to tech conferences and meetups but I\u2019m unsure if I should without a car and use public transport or not. Also I am a freelancer so it\u2019s feast or famine when it comes to money.\n\nCosmic timing Ali ! I\u2019m about to do this my self.. I\u2019ve been at a job that allows me to do this for about a year now , and my lease is up in July , so as soon as it is , I want to sell all my stuff and do it while I\u2019m still single and not having kids\n\nThank you so much for the heads up , in regards to loneliness and lack of routing - being a creature of habit I think I too would seriously miss this aspect Of everyday existence the most  ...\n\nPerHaps if I stayed longer than a month , like at least 3 at a time , it would enough to feel settled in .\n\nAnd to combat loneliness - I am pretty violently extroverted and usually end up making friends wherever I go .. just difficult when they don\u2019t speak English .\n\nAwesome! Yeah, hopefully by then things will be more open and you can go to events. I think that will be really helpful :)\n\nReally cool to share this experience! I would love to do something similar in Europe but am always a bit scared about the lack of routine and how hard would it be to meet people and build relationships in short term.\n\nThis post inspired me though! Thank you\n\nWhat if you are planning this in the country where you live right now.?\n\nI would be less scared if I plan it \"smaller\".\n\nAnd probably you already will get some good experience and confidence to do it in the whole Europe.\n\nThat is also a valid idea :) I am living in Austria currently, so small country if compared to where I come from, but still there are other cities where would be cool to live for a while!\n\nNeat! Thanks for sharing, especially the accountant bit!\n\nWe plan to launch in 2023. I joined a community called\n\nlast year, and I'll be keeping my membership up until the big day because there is just so much to learn! There are people in this community that do it with AirBnB like you. One of the other benefits is the private small groups in the community, such as the one for IT Professionals.\n\nStarlink will be in full swing by then, so hopefully we'll be more connected than ever so that we can be more disconnected than ever. Wrap your mind around that!\n\nOne of the things you said really stood out to me, and that was your comment about DC rent. In Annapolis we are are shelling out $3,700 a month between childcare and rent, and I didn't know how well that would prepare me for places like Norway which famously costs you about $25-35 dollars for fish and chips and a pint. Cool, we do that, too!\n\nIt comes up a lot in the group, because there is someone experiencing the digital nomad life at every level from financially independent to the most frugal families you've ever met. The first question I asked was whether or not I was ridiculous for wanting a 5th wheel for the three of us when there are people cramming 12 into a vintage Airstream, and I found that it's all about what is comfortable for you. It set me at ease. This is going to be our home for a few years while we are roadschooling/unschooling, after all.\n\nOh, and national parks are high on our list, too. \ud83d\ude04 I want to fill out one of the passports.\n\nWow, that sounds awesome!\n\nI consider every now and then to \"travel\" around the UK.\n\nAs I am not working in IT yet, my plan is/was to apply a global company which has stores around the country, so I can transfer myself between stores/businesses.  So, I would spend 2-5 months in each city on my list, keep working so I have income and the same time I explore everything in my free time.\n\nAs I came from another country without partner or family member, I already have experience how to spend my free time without feeling alone or lonely.\n\nThere are some really cool meetups and activity groups around the country which I would love to visit.\n\nWhat a cool goal you had! Staying nearby National Parks! If the possibility to work remotely stays in my company, I'd also consider moving closer to the mountains.\n\nThanks for sharing, Ali! I'm planning to be a digital nomad from next year first locally (in my country) and then internationally for the next few years.\n\nIt sounds exciting. Where would you like to go? Which cities are on your list?\n\nWe are planning to do the same next year, but go around Europe and Asia - I will document our adventures as digital nomads :)\n\nWhat a wonderful way to work, Id welcome the private time and time for me. That sounds like a bucket list item I may need to add.\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

I hacked into their computer and captured the USB traffic on it. Could you help me steal the secret?\n\nFlag format: flag{0-9a-z_} (Convert uppercase to lowercase)\n\nAttachments:\n\nFor this challenge, we are given a pcapng that contains USB protocol packets.\n\nMost of the packets are input packets labeled as\n\nby wireshark. There are, however, a few exceptions:\n\nThis packet and the one below it caught my attention because they are both output packets and contains ascii characters that resemble some sort of programming language.\n\nI copied one of the lines and did a quick google search.\n\nis what I found - a TSPL/TSPL2 Programming Language manual. Just like how 3d printers are controlled using G-code, it seems like that printers also have their own programming language.\n\nHere are the commands within the two packets:\n\nThe second packet seems to be the one that actually draws out the flag using two different commands:\n\nand\n\n. Now, I just have to implement the two commands in python and get the flag.\n\nHere is the code for that:\n\nIn the end, we get an image with the flag:\n\nflag:\n\nwho likes singing, dancing, rapping and shell-coding?\n\nThe directories on the server looks something like this:\n\nnc 139.180.215.222 20002\n\nnc 106.52.252.82 20002\n\nAttachments:\n\nAfter a quick analysis of the binary given, we see that the binary reads in 7 bytes of data, zero out most of the registers, and executes the data as shellcode.\n\n7-byte is not a lot. The\n\ninstruction itself takes up 2 bytes. Due to this size limitation, I decided to go with a two-stage approach. First, I will craft a 7-byte payload that will make a read syscall and read in a second stage payload. Second, I will craft a second stage payload that is more than 7 bytes and perform whatever task I want without worrying about any size limitations.\n\nI ran the binary in gdb just to see the state of the registers when our shellcode is being called. This is helpful as it allows us to utilize some of the existing register values:\n\nAs you can see, there\u2019s not a lot to work with, but we do have the address of the current buffer loaded in rdi.\n\nIn order to make the read syscall, we need four things:\n\nWe know that the syscall itself takes up 2 bytes and copying the address of the current buffer from rdi to rsi takes at least 2 bytes. This leaves us 3 bytes to zero out rdi and make rdx a large number:\n\nMy first idea was to move the address of the current buffer to rdx as it is quite a large number; however, it turns out to be too large and would not work.\n\nLooking for inspiration, I came across\n\n. Although it is written for 32 bit instead of 64 bit, it is still quite useful and helped me came up with my final payload:\n\nThis payload only uses 6 bytes of space! It relayed on the fact that\n\nis a single byte instruction, and due to its 32 bit nature, the current address is truncated to only 4 bytes before being loaded into rdx.\n\nNow, we successfully bypassed the size limitation and can run whatever code we want; however, the execve syscall seems to be blocked on the server. Bummer!\n\nBut we can still do an open/read/write to get the flag right? Well, now is a good time to review the challenge description:\n\nThe directories on the server looks something like this:\n\nAs you can see, the flag is hidden in a nested folder, and we need a way to find the path for the flag file.\n\nBasically, we need a way to list the content in a given directory. The first thing that came to me was the\n\ncommand, so I ran a strace on it:\n\nAll that we need is two syscalls:\n\nwhich opens a file descriptor for a given path and\n\nwhich list out the content of a directory.\n\nWith the help of the shellcraft module in pwntools, I quickly created a payload that can read out the content of a given directory:\n\nAnother minor inconvenience is the fact that the\n\nsyscall returns a linux_dirent struct for each file which needs to be parsed. Lucky, we can do that on the client side with python instead of parsing it with assembly:\n\nNow, with the ability to list all files in a given directory, we just need a program to recursively go through all the folders and find the flag file.\n\nBecause the server always timeouts before the flag file can be found, I also added the functionality to preserve progress so that I can get the path using multiple sessions.\n\nHere is the final code:\n\nWith this code, I found the flag file located at\n\n.\n\nNow with a simple payload, we can read out the flag:\n\nflag:"}

Hmm let\u2019s see. What happens when you open a blank page to write? Does anxiety kicks in?

Not many Romanians know about it. It\u2019s more of a regional thing. The people who would cook and eat \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie used to be shepherds. It\u2019s also possible that other cultures have a similar dish but I haven\u2019t yet met someone from outside my family that can describe anything similar to \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie.\n\n\u021a\u0103c\u0103lie is rich in calories and fat and it\u2019s best served hot. The caloric value it offers is extremely important for people like shepherds because of the long hours on the cold mountains. The ingredients and method of making \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie are also accessible. All they\u2019d have to do is carry a chunk of pig fat, some bread and an onion, then make a little fire.\n\nFor me \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie used to be a normal thing, whenever we\u2019d have a family BBQ, \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie was the first thing we made. I really enjoyed it as a kid and took years to learn the proper way of cooking it. Anybody can easily cook \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie but it takes multiple attempts to get all the little details right and perfect your method. This will only lead to the best of \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie, so well cooked that angles will weep for a taste of it.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until high school and talking with some friends that I realised I am the only one who knows about \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie.\n\nI cooked some \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie for some friends of mine and some couldn\u2019t even dare taste it. For some it is\n\nextremely heavy (you\u2019ll understand why shortly).\n\nWarning: Vegans and vegetarians will flee when exposed to \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie\n\n(pig fat with rind, Romanians call it\n\n)\n\nFor cooking you\u2019ll also need a stick (size matters, anything between 30-50cm should be good enough). Make sure the stick is strong enough to hold the chunk of pig fat and not too dry (spoiler alert, it all goes above a fire).\n\nWarning: Do not use a metal stick, the pig fat will slide right out after heating up. I recommend a cherry tree branch with a sharpened tip.\n\nTo get things started slightly cut your pig fat on all sides (excluding the skin side). Do not make the cuts too deep, as it could make it fall apart later. We do this to allow for better and more evenly cooking.\n\nNow cut the bread (slices, about 1cm thick, you can do thicker slices if you feel \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie is too heavy for you) and onion (any shape or size you like, I prefer rings). Place the onions slices/rings on the slices of bread and set everything near your grill.\n\nAt this point you should start your fire. Do not let the flame burn out, \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie is cooked using the flame not active charcoal. Take your stick and put the tip of it inside the fire (enough to chahr it, but don\u2019t set it on fire). Stick your chunk of pig fat on the stick.\n\nThis bit might sound easy but it\u2019s quite tricky to get it right. At this point you should have your chunk of slan\u0103 on the stick, your fire is roaring and the bread with onions is nearby.\n\nRepeat this process until each slice is covered in as much fat as you wish (see final product bellow for reference).\n\nTip: You can use some of the dripping fat to keep the fire alive or to extend it to new sections of the BBQ, thus ensuring you equally activate your charcoal.\n\nTip: When dripping fat on the bread, feel free to slowly and gently press the slan\u0103 on the bread.\n\nMaster tip: Sometimes the tip of your stick will set on fire.\n\n, this is the best thing that could happen but be careful. You can now tilt your stick with the tip facing almost completely down. Keep the stick above the bread and watch how the tiny flame will make the pig fat drip.\n\nAfter doing the above\n\na couple of times you will notice the exterior of the pig fat is cooked, at this point set it near your bread and start cutting the outer layer, revealing more raw uncooked pig fat ready for roasting.\n\nThe cooked fat is placed on top of the bread for added unhealthy pure tastiness.\n\nTip: At the point when you start cutting the first layer of cooked slan\u0103, you might want to take a short break and eat a slice, as \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie is best served hot. Reheating it is an option.\n\nNote: After cutting outer layers, make sure to make some more cuts on the surface to allow for more fat dripping and better roasting.\n\nAgain, repeat the above until all pig fat is cooked. Depending on the rind you have, it may be easy to bite trough and crunchy or extremely tough. It is comestible tho and I personally enjoy it.\n\nThis is how the final product should look like:\n\nIf you weren\u2019t disgusted by possibly the most unhealthy edible thing you\u2019ve ever heard, then you should know a couple of things."}

It was a nice sunny day, hopped on the early 7:45 train to Hope,\n\n. Little did I know that was the start of my new hobby and passion, hiking; as I recently went to Peak District again, done\n\nand the\n\ntrails. More on this down bellow.\n\nI tried to cover the most important aspects of my trip, but hiking is all about the moment and the experience. Hard to put into words the beauty of nature.\n\nBy far the best thing about going away from the day to day city craze, was the silence. After the train left the station, all I could hear was \u2026 nothing. Pure silence. It then occurred to me, that I have\n\nsomething, in a very long time. I had forgotten what silence was; the pure tranquility sensation.\n\nOn the first Hike, I did the climb to Ladybower Dam and got to see quite a bit of nature, the rural areas around Hope and saw how friendly outdoorsy people are. Everyone would salute you and people were more than eager to give directions and help you.\n\nAfter the rather easy hike to the dam, I went up to Win hill, where the view was very rewarding, as the climb is on some steep rocks trough a forested area with a stream of water on the side. From the peak you could see all around the valley and could even see the dam. The walk back down was much easier and quicker as it followed a path down and around the hill instead of climbing rocks.\n\nI would say that the first hiking experience wasn\u2019t that eventful, but nonetheless it was a special moment and the start of something beautiful.\n\nThis took place mid October on a cloudy day with some light rain. The hike was considerably longer than the first one (10km), and this time it involved walking across the peaks of Loose Hill. The view was nice, but due to the clouds and fog, visibility was limited.\n\nThe best part of this hike was the end destination, and what would end up becoming my new post-hike\n\n.\n\nA nice cozy place, right next to Edale Station. The staff there are like a big family, they\u2019re friendly and warm. The decor of the restaurant is homy and the food is just what you need after a long hike. On Sunday they have roast (pork or beef) with veggies and Yorkshire pudding. They also sell local ales (which are some of the best and most refreshing beers I\u2019ve had). To get an idea of how good the beer is, I asked if they sell bottles of the stuff (sadly no), so next time I\u2019ll see if I can bring my own bottle \ud83c\udf7a.\n\nThey are welcoming people, \u201cmuddy boots are welcome\u201d and \u201cdogs are welcome\u201d.\n\nLast weekend I spontaneously decided to go hiking again. I simply craved it, weather was good (by UK standards) and train tickets were still cheap. So I did it. Since my last hike I even invested in a hydration pack and some light, foldable, and strong hiking poles (which came in handy!).\n\nThe hike started off with a superb walk above a brook, trees with red, orange and yellow leaves, you get to cross a couple of rustic looking wooden bridges. The brooks valley even gets narrower and the hills on both sides are quite steep, giving an amazing feel when walking between em.\n\nAbout 2km in, the hike transforms into a little bit of a climb. The path becomes one with the brook and you have to carefully navigate your way from rock to rock on the brook. Then the elevation begins to take off, you start climbing up some rocks, with the brook still there. Making this a treacherous climb where one must be very confident in every move. The climb is about 1km with an elevation gain of 500m. For me that\u2019s the steepest path I had to take so far, but the climb is full of breathtaking scenery and as you go higher you get to see more and more of where you came from.\n\nUpon reaching the peak, you realise it\u2019s actually a plateau and you can see the entire valley where you walked. A little further in, most people will proceed to climb to an even higher peak, but not me. My trail map said\n\nand so I did.\n\nWhat was I expecting? From the map, I knew the trail would pass trough the\n\n. I expected a nice area, abundant in vegetation and tall trees, you know\n\n.\n\nWhat did I get?\n\nThe path I followed (at this point alone, as everybody else would go in the opposite direction) was next to a water stream and as such the ground was rather muddy and soft. Then the trail map said\n\nand so I did. After a while I found myself in a rather muddy area, with no visible path and no obvious direction to follow. The sun was still out and I was about 1/3 of the trail in so I pushed forward.\n\nAfter a kilometre of walking trough some rather shitty conditions (mud and weird terrain), fog set in out of a sudden; combined with the lack of a path and the only direction I knew being\n\n, I pushed on like any sane person would do.\n\nNot 5 minutes later I was in the middle of a post-apocalyptic scenario. Fog everywhere, terrain at this point was composed of\n\ncombined with\n\nand\n\n.\n\nThis is when it hit me. I am in a swamp.\n\nThere were many questions going on in my head at the time:\n\nI realised that I might not have the time (sunset was 2-3 hours away) to juggle around the terrain of the swamp, so I took a split second decision and I started going\n\nin the hopes of intersecting with the public footpath sooner rather than later.\n\nAfter adventuring trough the swamp like a mad man, trying to reach some solid ground. Getting mud all over my boots and pants, finding a rather suspicious metal box under some rocks and getting bad looks from frogs, I eventually got out of the fog, away from the mud and reached the Pennine footpath where I slowly walked my way back to Edale.\n\nIt was definitely an experience that I will not forget. And honestly I would do it again, this time going trough the entire swamp and maybe even see\n\n.\n\nI didn\u2019t cover the entire trip, there were other sights to see, like Jacob\u2019s ladder and the High Peak area.\n\nMore hiking stories to come (with full HD videos of the entire trip)."}

My method of reading the book has been rather unmethodical. Every couple of days/weeks when I feel like it, I pick up the book and continue reading where i last left off. Sometimes when I come across a strong thought (which happens more often than not in this book), I keep that thought in my mind and try to put it into action over time.\n\nThe following excerpt from the book has had a huge impact on me. I think about it very often and it reminds me of other quotes and sayings that I keep close to myself (and have collected mentally over the years)\n\nLiving life as an artist is a practice.\nYou are either engaging in the practice or you\u2019re not.\n\nIt makes no sense to say you\u2019re not good at it\nIt\u2019s like saying, \u201cI\u2019m not good at beting a monk.\u201d\nYou are either living as a monk or you\u2019re not.\n\nWe tend to think of the artist\u2019s work as the output.\n\nThe real work of the artist is a way of being in the world.\n\nThere is another quote from the Psychologist Alfred Adler that I heard back in 2015 and It has impacted the way I act on this very much. The quote goes as follows\n\n\u201cIt is easier to fight for ones principles than to live up to them.\u201d.\n\nSuch a strong statement. We all have principles, and there are principles that we very often are very strict about in \u201cwords\u201d and stricter when we see other people going against it. But, when it comes to us living by those principles, we very easily defy them and create loopholes for our own convenience. The way this has impacted my is as follows \u2013 In most cases before acting and saying things to people, I think if they are pragmatic or rather principle based. If they are principle based, I tend to not speak them as often as I would in past. These are my principles and as long as someone else is not crossing boundaries, I would allow them to live by theirs and I\u2019d \u201ctry\u201d to live by mine. I don\u2019t want to spend my time \u201cfighting\u201d for my principles. Atleast, I am not here to spread it, I think.\n\nThere is one more quote along similar lines as Rick Rubin. It\u2019s from \u201cThe Tibetian book of living and dying\u201d by Sogyal Rinpoche. I unfortunately don\u2019t recall the exact words from the book, and don\u2019t have a copy to get it from. But, the feeling of the words remain with me \u2013\n\nYou cannot meditate for some time and then be not meditating. That is not how meditation works. Meditation is a way of life.\n\nSpeaking for myself, I tend to think a lot about my principles and topics that I am interested in. And based on that, I try to live my life focusing on those topics, learning about them, acting as I belong to learn about those topics and create something with them. Its not important if the creation changes the world. Its not important if the creation is well known in the world. The only thing that is important is that it changes me. And, it changes me for good. I hope."}

Its raining cats and dogs. Actually, It\u2019s been raining non stop for the last 2 nights. The streets are flooded and the very little traffic that is out this stormy morning is being re-routed in multiple places. I am wondering how today will go.\n\n-\nSeveral of the organizing team reach the venue. We are setting up the venue, but there is a cloud of uncertainity. The rain is not something that we had factored in our planning.\n\n-\nI get a message \u201cAvinash, I believe you should consider cancelling today.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a thought that has already cross our minds. There\u2019s news of flood in several locations of Kathmandu. Several landslides have been reported. But we also had a commitment to everyone who registered. Even if just five people showed up, we felt we owed it to them to keep the show running. And that\u2019s exactly what we were going to do.\n\n- The first group of attendees show up. We were not expecting people to show up on time, let alone at all. This was the first motivation we needed for the day.\n\n-  A few more trickled in, and by now we had around 40 people. Not bad, right? Enough for a party. A BarCamp Party.\n\nBy the end of the day we had:\n\nSome fun facts:\n\nAll in all, I am really happy with the event and how it turned out. We (as wwktm) haven\u2019t had organized an event since covid, so getting back on the \u201corganizing\u201d wheel took quite a lot of effort, But in the end, I think we pulled it off.\n\nFor next time, though, if there\u2019s a BarCamp again [1], we\u2019ll definitely plan earlier and budget better. The ticket prices were kept low this time, and unfortunately, we ended up with a few financial losses. But I\u2019d like to think of it as an investment in future events rather than a loss.\n\n[1] Let me know what you thought about the event. Your feedback helps us improve and motivates us to keep going.\n\nUntil then,\n\nBe nice to everyone :D"}

This was a two day event completely focused on developing web applications which would also work on Firefox OS.\n\n###Day 1\nThe first day of the event was aimed at giving the audience an idea of mozilla, the mozilla community and Firefox OS, ofcourse. Vineel started by talking about mozilla and the community, Sayak continued by introducing the idea of Firefox OS and why it was required, Soumya then took on the stage and discussed some technical details about the platform and eventually Robin, Sayak, Biraj and me gave some demos on firefox OS application and the process of writing a basic \u201chello world\u201d application. The talks went pretty well but one thing that struck me was the audience. This was a very different audience, compared to other events because they were paying attention, asking questions, interacting and were actually making sense. Believe me, this rarely happens in an engineering college in India :D.\n\n###Day 2\nThe second day was roughly divided into two parts, the hackaton and the presentations. The hackathon went pretty well and most of the attendees got a taste of, how easy it was to make an application for firefox OS using open web technologies. It was amazing to see about 30 applications being presented at the end of the day. I guess, we can say it was a win!\n\nThat was all about the event. I would like to thank the FORMAT Team, especially Avik, Gaurab and Subhashish for the warm reception and managing the event in such a professional manner. Last but not the least, I got to learn a lot from Biraj, Vineel, Soumya, Robin and Sayak."}

I left in between the event as it didn\u2019t rise up to my expectations. I always thought that BarCamps are an open event with an open platform for people to learn and share their thoughts and hacks, atleast that\u2019s the impression one gets when they read about other BarCamps or its wiki. Since I didn\u2019t attend the whole event and didn\u2019t have the chance to give any feedback to the organizers or the team, I would take this as an opportunity.\n\nFirst of all, I felt very unhappy that the event was called a \u2018BarCamp\u2019 but didn\u2019t follow any of the unconventional conventions of a \u2018BarCamp\u2019. It would\u2019ve been better to name it different (to suit and cater to the proper audience) or to have made it a BarCamp style\u2019d event.\n\nSecond, Its okay to have some predefined speakers IMO to keep the show going, but there should be parallel tracks where people can propose talks or discussions, thus giving everyone an opportunity to share and learn.\n\nLastly, I have tried to stay constructive so that the organizers get an idea about the audience and how they felt at the end of the day. Hopefully, this would result in more interesting and happening events in the future. I\u2019m glad that at-least one of the 8 rules of BarCamp have been followed today (2nd Rule: You do blog about BarCamp.)\n\nPS. this BarCamp was unconventional because conventionally they are supposed to be unconventional, and this one, on the contrary was quite conventional."}

It was a great hike with a nice weather accompanied with some beautiful landscapes. Perfect recipe for a good hike.\n\nLike every other hikes, this one also helped me think deeply and contemplate about a number of things. Among them, most of my energy was spent on thinking about the hike itself.\n\nMost of it was directed towards how can we use Hike for Nepal to create some positive impact, possibly in the hiking location, during the hike. How can we bring some positive change, slowly and steadily.\n\nOne of the things that I noticed, the hike was full of well educated Nepalese who were decently well off (approximately 1 out of 5 had a DSLR, everyone had a pretty good camera phone). This was a great group of people, possibly a specific group that could do a lot for the community. Another topic that bugged me considerably during the hike was all the plastic packaging that was littered over the place. It was sad, how ignorant we have been towards our environment. From Wai-Wai packets to empty bottles everywhere. The first thing that we could definitely do to fight this is by cleaning the mountains and hills during our hikes. I did my part during the hike and we did something similar in one of our hikes in the Bavarian Alps.\n\nThe question that I would like to ask is, how can we scale this idea of cleaning the mountains during our hike? How do we scale it from one person to the whole group. The biggest benefit of this would be that hikers would learn to clean the mountains and take back their own garbage with them. Thus, ensuring the mountains to be clean, the nature to be serene and experiences to be breathtaking.\n\nFinally, I would like to remind one of the rules from the Golden Rules for Living\n\nIf you open it, close it.\nIf you turn it on, turn it off.\nIf you unlock it, lock it up.\nIf you break it, admit it.\nIf you can\u2019t fix it, call in someone who can.\nIf you borrow it, return it.\nIf you value it, take care of it.\n\nIf you move it, put it back.\nIf it belongs to someone else and you want to use it, get permission.\nIf you don\u2019t know how to operate it, leave it alone.\nIf it\u2019s none of your business, don\u2019t ask questions.\nIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it.\nIf it will brighten someone\u2019s day, say it.\nIf it will tarnish someone\u2019s reputation, keep it to yourself.\n\u2014 Found somewhere in the vast vast internet, Source unknown"}

In some cases I have also added the reasoning or the idea that is being sent across by the text or just notest that made sense to accompany them. I am still reading the whole essay and will at one point write my thoughts and views on it (maybe).\n\nThe essay mostly talks about why its important to know thyself; why knowing yourself and accepting your thoughts might be tough. The following part of the text talks about the times when one was not courageous enough to speak their heart or do what they heeded to do, and later realized that someone else said/did it and got all the glory (though some parts of the text also deals with why getting the glory, or working to get the glory is not important at all)\n\nA man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within, more than the lustre of the firmament of bards and sages. Yet he dismisses without notice his thought, because it is his. In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts: they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.\n\n.. Else, to-morrow a stranger will say with masterly good sense precisely what we have thought and felt all the time, and we shall be forced to take with shame our own opinion from another.\n\nThis part of the essay deals with one having to do something that they don\u2019t like, but are doing it just because it made sense at one point of time and they don\u2019t want to contradict themselves. It somehow goes into the lines of\n\nwhere one has the mental stress or discomfort because of contradictory beliefs in their mind and are motivated to reduce this dissonance (Based on the definition from wikipedia)\n\nThe other terror that scares us from self-trust is our consistency; a reverence for our past act or word, because the eyes of others have no other data for computing our orbit than our past acts, and we are loath to disappoint them.\n\nBut why should you keep your head over your shoulder? Why drag about this corpse of your memory, lest you contradict somewhat you have stated in this or that public place? Suppose you should contradict yourself; what then? It seems to be a rule of wisdom never to rely on your memory alone, scarcely even in acts of pure memory, but to bring the past for judgment into the thousand-eyed present, and live ever in a new day. In your metaphysics you have denied personality to the Deity: yet when the devout motions of the soul come, yield to them heart and life, though they should clothe God with shape and color. Leave your theory, as Joseph his coat in the hand of the harlot, and flee.\n\nWith consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words, and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said to-day. \u2014 \u2018Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood.\u2019 \u2014 Is it so bad, then, to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh.\n\nThe following paragraph tries to talk about the moment, and how one should live in the present and not sulk in the past or worry about the future. It is somehow way more philosophical compared to the rest of the text till this part. Similar ideas have been mentioned in Buddhist texts that talk about mindfulness and being available for the moment rathar than being in a different point of time.\n\nMan is timid and apologetic; he is no longer upright; he dares not say \u2018I think,\u2019 \u2018I am,\u2019 but quotes some saint or sage. He is ashamed before the blade of grass or the blowing rose. These roses under my window make no reference to former roses or to better ones; they are for what they are; they exist with God to-day. There is no time to them. There is simply the rose; it is perfect in every moment of its existence. Before a leaf-bud has burst, its whole life acts; in the full-blown flower there is no more; in the leafless root there is no less. Its nature is satisfied, and it satisfies nature, in all moments alike. But man postpones or remembers; he does not live in the present, but with reverted eye laments the past, or, heedless of the riches that surround him, stands on tiptoe to foresee the future. He cannot be happy and strong until he too lives with nature in the present, above time.\n\nOn failure, and pressures from the society and believing in yourself.\n\nIf our young men miscarry in their first enterprises, they lose all heart. If the young merchant fails, men say he is ruined. If the finest genius studies at one of our colleges, and is not installed in an office within one year afterwards in the cities or suburbs of Boston or New York, it seems to his friends and to himself that he is right in being disheartened, and in complaining the rest of his life. A sturdy lad from New Hampshire or Vermont, who in turn tries all the professions, who teams it, farms it, peddles, keeps a school, preaches, edits a newspaper, goes to Congress, buys a township, and so forth, in successive years, and always, like a cat, falls on his feet, is worth a hundred of these city dolls. He walks abreast with his days, and feels no shame in not \u2018studying a profession,\u2019 for he does not postpone his life, but lives already. He has not one chance, but a hundred chances. Let a Stoic open the resources of man, and tell men they are not leaning willows, but can and must detach themselves; that with the exercise of self-trust, new powers shall appear; that a man is the word made flesh, born to shed healing to the nations, that he should be ashamed of our compassion, and that the moment he acts from himself, tossing the laws, the books, idolatries, and customs out of the window, we pity him no more, but thank and revere him, and that teacher shall restore the life of man to splendor, and make his name dear to all history.\n\nTo the end of the essay, the author talks about the\n\n. To begin with, I had a totally different view on travelling, like the \u201chow it changes you\u201d and \u201cyou discover yourself\u201d view that the world has, but since the last\n\n\u2044\n\nmonths, I have come to realise that travelling is just a concept that has come from romantic consumerism. Author\n\nbriefly talks about it in his book\n\nas well. Nevertheless, this is a different view on the same thing and was quite interesting to read, since it is dated from the 19th century.\n\nTravelling is a fool\u2019s paradise. Our first journeys discover to us the indifference of places. At home I dream that at Naples, at Rome, I can be intoxicated with beauty, and lose my sadness. I pack my trunk, embrace my friends, embark on the sea, and at last wake up in Naples, and there beside me is the stern fact, the sad self, unrelenting, identical, that I fled from. I seek the Vatican, and the palaces. I affect to be intoxicated with sights and suggestions, but I am not intoxicated. My giant goes with me wherever I go.\n\nTo wrap things up,\nA quote from the book Khushi by Vijay Kumar (\u0916\u0941\u0938\u0940 - \u0935\u093f\u091c\u092f \u0915\u0941\u092e\u093e\u0930 ) is very apt to this topic:\n\n\u0905\u093e\u092b\u0942\u0932\u093e\u0908 \u0905\u093e\u092b\u0948\u0901 \u092a\u0930\u093f\u092d\u093e\u0937\u093f\u0924 \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0928\u0901 \u092d\u0928\u0947 \u0905\u0930\u0941\u0932\u0947 \u092e\u0932\u093e\u0908 \u0924\u093f\u0928\u0915\u0948 \u0938\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0926\u0905\u0928\u0941\u0938\u093e\u0930 \u092a\u0930\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0930 \u092c\u0928\u093e\u090f\u0930 \u0916\u093e\u0928\u0947\u091b\u0928\u094d \u0964\n\u2013 \u0932\u094b\u0930\u094d\u0921\u0947\n> If I don\u2019t define myself others will make a dish of me based on their taste and eat.\n\nPS: still reading and will be adding stuff"}

Nothing has changed in the once peaceful country. That peaceful country where people are fighting; They are divided, divided by caste, divided by religion, divided by color, divided by reason, divided without any reason. Fight all day long, fight for your ego, fight for the fake pride and then in the end of the day take pride in being the most peaceful country in the world, take pride in being the most peaceful people, take pride in coming from the land of Buddha. Great, at least we are the quintessential hypocrites.\n\nIt\u2019s sad to see the leaders fighting like children. Oh come on, we had fairer fights when we were kids. It\u2019s funny to see the parties organize a meeting with the other parties, and follow it with their own personal meetings; its clear they have no philosophy, no pride, no compassion, all they want is to maximize their profits. This child play has been the norm in one way; it has pulled everyone centuries behind. Centuries behind in thinking, in science, in contribution to society.\n\nThe smart world is working on nurturing the future generation. We? we have already lost them, we have failed them. Those kids should be studying in school, challenging their teachers, learning from their mentors, painting, drawing and solving that random equation. But, NO! They are everywhere but not where they should be. They are sitting in home playing, they are working in that brick factory where they legally shouldn\u2019t be, and they are lying on that corner of the street burning grass. But then, how could they go to school? The teachers are not motivated to teach the students; In most cases, they are there because that is the last job they could find, one that pays the least and our society has accepted it that way. Why? Simply because they are not a part of the vicious romantic consumerism cycle. If only they could produce something that could be exchanged with money. All they are doing is building the future, adding some fine touches to it, how can that be important? No gains at all!\n\nThe situation is saddening, and its getting worse day by day. Every day a political party is angry, the schools are closed! a wife and a husband have a fight, the schools are closed. I am sure this situation frustrates many more and I am aware that there are wiser beings that are working on fixing this, trying to be a part of the solution. Not rant like me by making a fuss of the problem. I think there is only one right way to solve this problem and its not a quick one, its one that takes its time but does the job. We have to change our culture, our society, our views. Education has to be taken seriously. We have to build better schools, develop infrastructure. Not schools that are money making machines, but schools that are shaping better humans and better futures. Invest the money a school generates into the teachers, into other schools. Build standards, standards that schools have to be built up to. The government has to play an active role in this, the political parties have to play an active role in this, we the citizens have a bigger role to play in this. Government schools have to rise, rise to standards that set benchmarks. The system has to invest into the future, the future that will build the system in return."}

It\u2019s 9:15am and Ravi dai, our MC for the day kicks off the show. Each talk was interesting and gave enough to the audience. Enough to implement, research and learn once they were back from the event.\nThere were number of fun moments while the speakers were on stage. Some of my most memorable ones are\n\nEven though the internet was patchy, it was exciting to see the attendees posting a lot of fun stories and pictures on social media. The day was intense, full of insightful talks and many nice memories to go back and sleep on.\n\nHike more. Worry Less. - anonymous\n\nIt\u2019s 6:00am, the designated time to leave for the hike and guess what, our venue is not open yet !! Damn, Guard Dai !!! Finally, the venue opens up, we fill our bottles, get an initial briefing about the hike, get into our Sajha bus and off we go.\n\nWe reach Lakhuri Bhanjyang and Kailash from artudio gives an amazing introduction to art. He explains how you can do art with anything and it likes in the eyes of the maker. We then divide into groups based on our tshirt color -\n\n. The whole hike we used materials from nature to build small art pieces. It was the best exercise to get to know other people from our groups.\n\nThe main motive of the hike was for the attendees, speakers and organizers to mingle more and get to network at a more deeper level. I think that\u2019s what exactly happened as I got to talk to so many people and know what they were doing, get an understanding of their point of view and have deeper conversations about tech, life, community and nature.\n\nApart from the main conference and hike, some of the speakers and attendees took the opportunity to do other activities. Some of the highlights are:\n\nThere will definitely be a next wwktm. In what capacity, design, format? That is a thought for another blog post.\n\nUntil then,\n\nBe nice to everyone :D"}
{"url": "https://avinash.com.np/2014/02/23/what-i-initially-planned-to-do-this-summer/", "origin": "https://avinash.com.np/", "title": "What I initially planned to do this summer", "content": "TL;DR : This is mostly going to be a post about how things have fucked up recently and how my plans of doing an internship this summer went into the dump and some extensions and pre-post thought process to that.\n\nMy ideal summer would be an internship at one of the best tech companies working and learning with/from the most talented people of the industry. Contrary to the fact that a lot would suggest to do it at a startup, I wanted to do it at a big company because I have never worked at one and wanted to learn from that experience. It must be magic to manage so many people, so many developers and still spit out the best of the products.\n\nI applied to number of companies but I would like to comment on my experience with facebook, microsoft and mozilla. Facebook was kind of sad because I had an interview where I was asked some basic questions about JavaScript and we talked about how some things were implemented in facebook. Post the interview, they didnt reply for about a month and when I contacted the recruiter, got a reply that I couldn\u2019t be offered a postition. Sad :\u2018(\n\nNext was Microsoft. This one was really surprising because the interviewer asked me some really random question and two puzzles and eventually replied with a negative. Maybe I was supposed to not solve the puzzles.\n\nWhen all this action was happening, I had also applied for an internship at mozilla. This was one that I had some expectations from, mostly because I had been a contributor to mozilla for some time and luckily there was an open internship position for a project that I had already been contributing to. I applied and Kaboom, \u201cwe did not find a fit this time\u201d. This was very disheartening, but I eventually talked to one of the project devs about it and he told that he\u2019d look into it. About a week later, I got an email from a recruiter saying they\u2019d like to interview me for the internship. Yay!\n\nWell, that did sound awesome, I hopped into the opportunity and did some reading, sharpening that blade. I had 3 really interesting interviews and after quite a long wait I got an email which basically said that they\u2019d like to move with another candidate mostly because he had more experience and I still had a year of university to learn from(o_O).\n\nSo, basically after this I was quite sad and felt really bad. I for one thought a lot about this and there were the times when I thought maybe I was not good at all. This brought me to think about some of my open source contributions as well. I used to contribute to open source mostly because I was learning a lot and learned a lot about good code, code review, processes and approach to some serious problems. But, with of all of this it also felt like why was I even contributing to a project where I was not even worth it. Sadly, I do feel that at times, but I like it when I learn.\n\nI know recruiting is a tough work and there are some tough and quick decisions to make because of which a lot of factors come into play like where one comes from, where one is currently located, one\u2019s name and lots of other tiny details. I dont say its intentional but everyone is judgemental when you have to make a decision. That is why I know lots of amazing people back in India and Nepal who have been rejected who I think are among the A grade talent and lots of people would agree to me. Maybe there\u2019s a problem, one that seriously needs to be solved. But yes, this doesn\u2019t change the fact that I may be useless as well (lets hope I\u2019m not).\n\nWell, I have been conspirating on some secret schemes with a bunch of amazing people and I must say, I am enjoying it. Regarding contributing to mozilla, I would be (as a developer)inactive for a while, for sure, maybe a lot more. But I am still the guy who contributes to the open web and loves to see the web crossing it boundaries."}

Where is Fun? It is so relative I have learned, it depends on how your mind is wired and where your heart it. For some, partying all night long and having an insane night might be the fun that quenches the thirst. But, for some, maybe being able to stick to the timeline might just be the fun that is added to life. Being able to sleep on time and wake up a fresh man every other day is just what you find fun in. Maybe when you are partying In a club, that moment you have of being bored might be just when you feel sad that your weeks schedule is wasted . And that\u2019s where you know where you really find fun in.\n\nJust think about it though, main stream media had just brainwashed everyone to think that there is only one type of fun and that one type of fun is what\u2019s cool. Who are they to define what is cool? Who are they to rule on what our heart thinks of our mind ?\n\nWell, that fairly brings me to the main point. Do what you like, hear that silent vibration in that random corner of your heart. Do what you think is right, but think for once, is it really right ? Or are you being selfish ? Or are you just not being empathetic. Rely on that one self that you know, that you must believe in, that one self you are."}

It fills me with pride looking at how far we have come, and how colorful and eventful (ba-dum-tiss) the community has become. There is an event every week or so, community-leaders are meeting often discussing about maximizing community interaction. The best part of it is that the community also feels that we need to have such events. Now, that\u2019s all Roses, lets talk about the Thorns. I would like to disucss a Thorn in specific.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t even been a week in 2017 and I have had two event invites. YAY! that\u2019s so awesome, right? NO! Why? you may ask. The reason is that I couldn\u2019t attend either of the two events. People were notified a couple of days in advance about the event. I\u2019m really sorry to put this out, even though it should have been obvious, two days prior notice for a meeting/event  is too less of a time. Inviting the community atleast one week in advance should be part of the event etiquette recipe. We are failing at this. It is a collective failure and we should try to fix this.\n\nSo, what can we do about this? I have a proposition especially for dev/tech events.\n\nIf there is a better way of doing this, I am all ears, lets talk in the slack channel."}
{"url": "https://avinash.com.np/2017/07/15/corrupt-or-unorganized/", "origin": "https://avinash.com.np/", "title": "Corrupt or Unorganized", "content": "Chaos is a Ladder \u2014 Little Finger, GoT\n\nThis is to compare and contrast two worlds, two stories that seem the same but totally different experiences.\n\nI don\u2019t remember the exact date, but, in 2014 someone shipped me a piece of gadget to Germany. I got a letter which asked to be present at the customs office in 3 days.\n\nI went to the customs office. Had a talk with a super helpful lady, who helped me get my shipment. She then asked me to open the package, did an inspection of what was shipped. Finally, she told me the import duty  which I had to pay for the shipment. In less than 15 minutes I was out of the office and my job was done.\n\nOne month ago someone again shipped me a piece of gadget. This time it was sent to Kathmandu, Nepal. FedEx told me that my shipment was at the airport customs and I had to get hold of an agent at the customs to get my shipment. They delivered me the documents which I could use to extract the shipment.\n\nAll good and fine. I talked to an agent and handed him my documents, which were to be used to extract the shipment from the customs. I hoped it to be a quick and painless process. Unfortunately, the introduction of an agent to the process keeps us in the dark; Now, I have no idea what\u2019s going on in customs land.\n\nEach of my discussion with the customs agent was basically that the shipment couldn\u2019t be extracted and they\u2019ll try again tomorrow. After ~20 days I pushed the agent a little and tried to get more details. According to them, someone had shipped gold via FedEx which is why customs were not letting any FedEx document be extracted.\n\nI went to the customs office, and It was chaotic. It took me hours to find the right person to talk to. Basically, just to hear the same gold story again.\n\nIn the mean time, I mentioned this to FedEx as well, the only support they could give me was \u201cI\u2019ll talk to my superior and see how we can help you here\u201d\n\nFast forward today, I still don\u2019t have my shipment. Nepal Government still doesn\u2019t have the customs duty they deserve. Lose-Lose situation. Unless, my shipment has been hijacked and a customs official has gifted it to his son. Then, someone does win here. Believe me, I have heard stories of that happening.\n\nThis process is seriously messed up and is the story of pretty much every government office in Nepal. The processes in offices are so chaotic, super ad-hoc and enough touch points to exploit a person. Which is also the reason why going to a government office is a dreadful experience every time.\n\nOur systems are messed up, our processes are messed up and the sad part is that there is no one doing anything about it. The only place one can complain or state grievances is to a twitter handle (or bot) of HelloSarkar. It definitely gives one a feeling of being heard, but nothing happens in the end.\n\nThis one time, all I have is a rant. No solutions, No actions that can be taken to make things better.

{"url": "https://avinash.com.np/2013/11/01/the-month-of-mozilla--learning-teaching-and-experiencing-the-openweb/", "origin": "https://avinash.com.np/", "title": "The Month of Mozilla : Learning, Teaching and Experiencing the OpenWeb", "content": "To make things less confusing, lets start from the beginning. It all started back in mid-2013 when my twitter stream and facebook newsfeed was filled with status-es like \u201cIt\u2019s official, you\u2019re invited! Yay!\u201d and there in my mailbox was an unread email with the same subject. Yes, It was official and I was invited too :D. It was an invitation to attend the Mozilla Summit 2013 to be hosted simulatneously in 3 cities (Brussels, Toronto and Santa-Clara) and with the mission for (almost) all mozillians to come together, get inspired, talk and shape the future of the open web.\n\nFast forward to October 2013, after a flight from Munich via Amsterdam, I was standing in front of the Brussles airport, there were the amazing summit volunteers waiting to greet mozillians and make sure we reach the right hotel. I checked into the hotel, went to the square to grab dinner/snacks and the awesome goodie bag. Next stop was the Delirium Cafe (also known for having the guiness world record for the most variety of beer in 2004) where i met a lot of awesome mozillians.\n\nOver the next couple(+1) of days i attended sessions related to privacy on the web (where we discussed about ghostery and collusion- now knows as Lightbeam), using the developer tools to debug other XUL based applications (especially thunderbird), Mozilla Reps program, MDN, OpenBadges, having a million mozillians. One thing that i liked about each session is that it was a two way session and it included more discussions and less of one way communication.\n\nOther than the sessions, I think the world fair and the innovation fair were the two awesome places to be in the summit as it gave one an opportunity to see how spread we are as mozillians and how awesome we are too.\n\nWell, you attended an event - AWESOME, but what you take away from the event decides how successful it was and how it would help you in the coming days. Here\u2019s what i got to takeaway.\n - Getting to know some of the faces behing the IRC nicks, turns out i couldnt\u2019 meet all the faces\n - Meeting the mozillians from Europe. I would like to give a special shout out to Axel Grude (the awesome AMO guru), Raivis (The Latvian mozillian, localizer, webdev, awesome!), Rimas (localizer, techie from Lithuania) and Sjmur (Mozilla ireland community manager).\n - A week after the summit and i had already helped Axel test(and find a bug too) one of his\n\nand made it to his contributor list.\n - Last but not the least, leaving with the motivation to do more and the feeling that your work is making a difference.\n\nAnother mail, another set of flights and here I am in London, Running to the Mozilla office directly from the airport to attend a reps meeting session regarding the Mozilla Festival. Oh, did i say that this was the biggest MozFest till date. This was quite a different event from other Mozilla events, because of the new set of audience and the new set of motivation. The Mozilla Festival is all about building and hacking, as they say (F*ck it, Ship it).\n\nThe first day of the event officially started with the science fair at the evening, leaving us (as facilitators) a whole day to get an idea of the flow of the event and our role in it. Me and Prashish were part a of the scrum led by Kat and Laura, where we had a wall full of problems and an army of awesome-scurm-leads (More on the scrum later). Then we had the hack-your-tshirt session where we hacked our tshirts with spray paint and sketch-pens. The event had a mega version of it with paints and what not (more on that later). Then, kicked off the real deal of the day, the Science festival. There were some awesome projects, experiments and products being displayed but i would like to give a special mention to goolabs (for their awesome work with 3d on the web), Erase all kittens(for how awesome+weird+different their approach to teaching and gaming is) and the tactile web demo from the Mozilla Japan team (believe me they were awesome)\n\nThe Day 2 kicked off with the keynotes and then moving to the track they belonged to. I first went to the #teachTheWeb track, as we were part of that track. There was a beautiful wall of\n\nwaiting to be in the making and be made eventually :D . Then i went to the openbadges section to hack on some custom badges and badges of the future. While browsing other badges i was way inspired by the\n\n. Then came the most important and happening event of the day, the Maker-Party. I am so glad that i didnt miss it, because the aurora and the spirit at the maker party was amazing (more than that). People working on stop-motion-videos, children learning to code, people making games using scratch, making (the so sweet)kumi dolls, and a lot more (there were so many things happening that i might have forgot some). That was most of the first day which ended with some awesome conversations with Henrik, Jan, Prashishh, Michael and Leo over the course of Japanese food.\n\nThe third day was mostly similar with attending more awesome sessions, meeting more awesome people, painting some more t-shirts :P and learning more intriguing ways to teach and engage people.\n\nI think the biggest takeaway from this event was how important learning is and how big a role the teacher/teaching method plays in the process. I personally learned a variety of different ways people were using to teach webmaking and moreover dozens of ways people were using the web to make things. Again, a big shout out to all the Mozilla Reps (you all are awesome), It was a great pleasure meeting each one of you.\n\nWell, I wanted to especially thank the Mozilla Nepal community (especially Avash for taking the lead initially), and the people behind the first Mozilla South Asian Meetup, where i got to meet all the community leaders (especially Deb, who is my mentor too) who eventually guided me and helped me to contribute."}

If we all had to grow our own food, we wouldn\u2019t waste a third of if (as we do now in the UK). If we had to make our own tables and chairs, we wouldn\u2019t throw them out the moment we changed the interior d\u00e9cor. If we could see the look on the face of the child who, under the eyes of an armed soldier, cuts the cloth for the garment we contemplate buying on the high street, we\u2019d probably give it a miss. If we could see the conditions in which a pig is slaughtered, it would put most of us off our bacon butty. If we had to clean our own drinking water, we sure as hell wouldn\u2019t shit in it.\u201d\n\nToday, Friday the\n\nis considered to be the biggest shopping festival of the year, also (in) famously termed as Black Friday. People go out on a limb and buy more stuff than they need, even more stuff than they can consume and even more stuff than they can ever make sense of. Why? Because its cheap and because the rest of the world is also doing it.\n\nToday, Friday the\n\nhas also been very smartly chosen (like every year) as the\n\n. The idea of it is not to stop people from buying on this chosen date, but it is to start understanding about one\u2019s consuming behavior and\n\n. People should start connecting with the things they consume, connecting with the people who make them and try to understand the implications of what they buy and what kind of processes they are giving their money to.\n\nThe Motto is simple \u201c Buy what you need, not what you want. \u201c. Our choices has led us to industrialization, which brought a lot of nice goodies and with all the nice came the bad as well. The world got divided, the poor countries make and the rich countries consume. There is an incentive to have cheap labor in the world. The only way we can make a difference is by being aware of our choices. I find it funny that we have to pay a premium for \u201cfair-trade\u201d and are very comfortable with the default. Shouldn\u2019t it be the other way round, that all products are \u201cfair-trade\u201d by default and the products that have had unfair procedures would be labeled as \u201cunfair-trade\u201d. I guess, that would be a good behavioral hack.\n\nThese are just some of my thoughts about consumerism. I like the idea of the\n\n, pushing us to be better humans, to be a better part of the society, be more aware of the world and our impact to it and taking a step by being the change we want to see. Remember,\n\n\u201cIt is easier to fight for one\u2019s principles than to live up to them.\u201d\n\nSo, live up to your principles. Make sure you have some, if not, I think ^^ (up there) is a good starting point :) ."}
{"url": "https://avinash.com.np/2015/11/22/on-forgiveness/", "origin": "https://avinash.com.np/", "title": "On Forgiveness", "content": "What do you think is the right course of action, bringing justice by punishment or forgiving the wrongdoer? Fighting the fight for ego or forgiving? These are tough discussions to have and there is enough philosophical evidence to justify either side of the argument. I have come to believe that there is no \u201cright-way\u201d or \u201cthe recipe\u201d that one can follow, one must always think about the implications, the stakeholders involved and the bigger picture and take the righteous action. Even though there is no golden rule there are set of doctrines and frameworks one can follow that is considered to be on a higher moral ground.\n\nMost of the times when we are thinking of forgiveness, the alternate course of action is radical, extreme, one that we consider not ourselves. The reason to be in such a state is generally because our pride has been touched, the ego has been hurt and betrayal has been committed.\n\n.. the same dualism underlies the nature and condition of man. Every excess causes a defect; every defect an excess. Every sweet hath its sour; every evil its good. Every faculty which is a receiver of pleasure has an equal penalty put on its abuse. It is to answer for its moderation with its life. For every grain of wit there is a grain of folly\u2026\n\nEmerson has very nicely said that the world is an equation and everything that is done will have a reaction. If that\u2019s the case then does it not make sense to follow the path of peace and let nature do its job. Why should we take part in the wrongdoing? Because we want to satisfy our ego, want our pride back. What guarantee is there that the pride is restored after the action? None. Maybe it is better to live without pride, without happiness. Being neutral in every sense. Every happiness will have its sadness.\n\nNo man had ever a point of pride that was not injurious to him.\n\nSimilar was the situation of Yudhishthir in Mahabharat when he was persuaded by his wife and brothers to go to war and fight against Duryodhan. This was during their time in exile. His response was that its harder to give forgiveness, it takes more energy to forgive.\n\nForgiveness is the strength of the virtuous. To fight is easy, but to forgive is difficult. To be patient is not to be weak; to seek peace is always the wiser course.\n\nThe epic has it that they went to war, the great battle of kurukshetra took place and after numerous tricks and deceits of Krishna (the charioteer and God) they win the war, they get their kingdom back. At this point of time Yudhishthir doesn\u2019t have pride in winning the war, is not content to have his kingdom back. On the contrary, he is sad, in remorse, in pain, thinking about all the deaths of his teacher, his brothers, his men.\n\nTo get a piece of the earth we totally abandoned men who were equal to the earth, men whom we should never have killed. And now we live with our kinsmen dead and our wealth exhausted\u2026 like dogs we greedily went after a piece of meat! Now our piece of meat is gone, and so are those who would have eaten it. The heroes are dead. The evil is done. Our kindgom has been laid waste. Having killed them, our rage is gone. Now this grief holds me in check!\nExcerpts from Mahabharat -\n\n(The difficulty of being Good)\n\nOne might argue if the path of forgiveness is always the higher moral ground, wouldn\u2019t the world be unfair. What would have happened to slavery in America? what would happen to Indians under the British Raaj ? What would have happened to Jews during WWII ? These are all valid questions and it does seem like forgiveness has a conflict with Justice in a larger sense.\n\nOne way to look at it is by weighing the deeds. Some deeds have so much evil, there is so much bad into it that it is beyond forgiveness or the psychological burden of forgiveness is too high to be granted. This does mean that its not our strength at display but our weakness at display in this case. In Mahabharat, Yudhishthir before going to war, justifies it as his duty and an act he must do even though he doesn\u2019t like it. Maybe the idea is to look at the bigger good and act accordingly. These are nevertheless really tough decisions to make and maybe your duty is what can justify the course of action. Maybe that is how Jack Dorsey would also justify\n\n.\n\nThese are very tough topics to think about and to come to a worthy conclusion. All I can say and suggest is to think of the possibilities, weight all the options, see the impact and then eventually\n\n. One fun learning I\u2019ve had is that, it is much easier to write on this topic than to have a contextual discussion."}

When I was\n                            18, I dropped out of university to support a friend accused of terrorism, because I believe\n                            it\u2019s most important to support people when others don\u2019t.

I\u2019ve spent the last decade working on that\n                            because I think it could be one of the keys to making AI safe.\n\nServing others and working on important problems is a privilege, but it isn't the only thing\n                            I want in life.\n                            More than almost anything, I want to have a family: to have a partner and children to share\n                            life with.\n                            I\u2019ve been lucky to date several wonderful women, but it\u2019s always turned out we weren\u2019t quite\n                            looking for the same things.

Dreams and ideas which spark my excited\n                            enthusiasm. Facts about the world which trigger an earnest drive to help. These topics feel\n                            close to who I am, woven into my soul. When I\u2019m around others who share similar feelings,\n                            part of me opens up. I am more myself, and can form deeper connections.\n\nA formative experience for me has been moral loneliness. As a young child, I was upset about\n                            how animals are treated but didn\u2019t know anyone with similar beliefs. As a teenager, I\n                            struggled with the Bible and became an atheist. But becoming an atheist left me alone in\n                            caring intensely about global poverty (this is something I still admire about the church I\n                            grew up in). As an adult, I\u2019m lucky to have found friends and community with similar values\n                            but\u2026 I\u2019d really love to find moral connection in a relationship.\n\nWhat do I mean by \u201cmoral connection\u201d? I don\u2019t mean believing all the same things: the last\n                            thing I\u2019d want would be for either of us to feel constrained in our independent moral\n                            judgment! But I think it would be lovely to have enough shared fundamental values to not\n                            feel alone, and to really see and value in each other our efforts to be good people. (I\n                            suspect an important part of balancing moral independence and connection is\n\n.)\n\nWhat are my values? I try \u2013 although I obviously don't always live up to this \u2013 to be\n                            genuinely truth-seeking, care about the welfare of all humans and animals, and be willing to\n                            act to improve them. I viscerally care about animal welfare and global poverty. I work on AI\n                            safety because I think there's a serious risk of it being unsafe. (Many values I hold are\n                            associated with Effective Altruism. However, there are also some things I'd disagree with\n                            the EA mainstream on, and I generally value moral independence.)\n\nI\u2019m not sure how exactly to articulate this, but I feel like the default trajectory of my\n                            life is to optimize it for efficiency and impact. Those are meaningful things to me \u2013\n                            especially as they relate to helping the world \u2013 but I don\u2019t want that to be the entirety of\n                            my life. I also don\u2019t want to get pulled into consumerism, or hedonism, or lots of other\n                            lifestyle attractors around me. Instead, I\u2019m \u2013 confusedly, graspingly, stumbling \u2013 trying to\n                            find something related to family, and connection, and reflection, and integrity.\n                            Wholesomeness.\n\nSomehow this idea of seeking \u201cwholesomeness\u201d feels very intertwined with relationships. I\n                            guess because \u201cfamily\u201d feels like a central part of it? Or because many of these things feel\n                            most meaningful when you\u2019re sharing them with someone?\n\nI\u2019m not really sure what it would look like for us to try and find wholesomeness in this\n                            sense. It\u2019s something we\u2019d need to find out together! Maybe we should live in a village with\n                            friends. Maybe we should build a home and live in the woods. Maybe we should drink tea every\n                            morning together as the sun rises. Maybe it\u2019s smaller subtle things. But if the vague thing\n                            I\u2019m gesturing at resonates with you, I\u2019d at least be an enthusiastic partner as we stumble\n                            towards it together.\n\nAside: I really like\n\nas one\n                            possible vision of \u201cwholesomeness\u201d, in particular threads that just have pictures of his\n                            family and their home.\n\nI find math deeply beautiful, and I get a lot of meaning out of it. This is true of science\n                            broadly as well, although to a somewhat lesser extent. I get a lot of joy out of learning\n                            and exploring and being curious and discovering. I\u2019d love to share that with you. I\u2019d love\n                            to work through a textbook we both find interesting, or research some topic, or do a small\n                            project. I\u2019d love to whiteboard, and share what we\u2019re thinking about, and be curious about\n                            the world together.\n\n(It\u2019s worth saying that this isn\u2019t necessarily an easy thing to do. I think a lot of people\n                            who are very intellectual can feel intellectually insecure talking to their partner. What if\n                            they say something \u201cdumb\u201d and their partner rejects them intellectually? But I think if we\n                            want to, we can work together to have an environment that\u2019s safe and allows us to explore\n                            ideas together.)\n\n... I also just find it really attractive when someone is genuinely fascinated by math or\n                            science. I'm usually slow to develop crushes, but a striking exception was an occasion when\n                            someone at a party rambled to me about cool biology papers they'd read recently for half an\n                            hour. Instant crush.\n\nMore than almost anything, I\u2019m excited to have a family with a partner someday. I\u2019m excited\n                            to do it with a particular set of motivations: to have a family, not just because it\u2019s a\n                            thing people do by default, but because it\u2019s an adventure we\u2019re both deeply excited for and\n                            invested in. To be trying to learn, together, how to make it beautiful and meaningful and\n                            alive, even when there are tricky moments. (To be clear: I fully expect having children to\n                            have lots of unpleasant and exhausting parts!)\n\nI\u2019m excited to have children, but I\u2019m even more excited to have children with someone. When I\n                            imagine it, a big part of what I\u2019m looking forward to is sharing it as a powerful, deep\n                            connection to my partner. Just the thought that there\u2019s a small possibility that a\n                            relationship might someday lead to having children with someone gives me an almost\n                            intoxicating sense of connection.\n\nI love going on walks after it rains. These photos were all taken at a\n                                park near my house. I\u2019d love to show you if we end up dating!\n\nIt\u2019s often unclear why relationships don\u2019t work out, but here are a few things I think were\n                            factors, in case they can help us avoid similar incompatibilities:\n\nDating profiles can be highly polished pictures of someone. I\u2019ve tried very hard to be\n                            earnest, but even so it\u2019s a very limited view. Thankfully, I have years of a pretty\n                            extensive online presence that might offer a more holistic picture. One starting point might\n                            be the\n\nand\n\n, or this\n\n.

And only in Japan. It centers on a young boy, Boku, spending a month of his summer vacation with his aunt, uncle, and their family in the countryside of Japan in August of 1975.\n\nPlayers can explore the countryside as Boku, collect bugs, fish, fly kites, and other low-stakes activities you might expect from a child on summer break.\n\nSlowly, you learn about the people around you and their stories.\n\nSounds simple, but watch Tim\u2019s review and you\u2019ll see that the game is a subtle masterclass in storytelling, menu design, cinematography, typography, skeuomorphism, Japanese culture, sound design, memory, and even mortality.\n\nI became determined to experience the game myself, which is easier said than done given that it was never released outside of Japan. I managed to find\n\n, translated by a fan, for the game\u2019s sequel Boku no Natsuyasumi 2: Umi no Bouken-hen (My Summer Vacation 2: Sea Adventure Chapter). The sequel, released two years after the original, also follows a boy named Boku vacationing in the countryside in August of 1975.\n\nArmed with the patch file, I needed 3 more items to complete my quest: a PS2 emulator, a PS2 BIOS (the software pre-installed on the console\u2019s chipset), and a copy of Boku no Natsuyasumi 2.\n\nLuckily, the emulator is easy to come by. I downloaded\n\n, which is an open source PS2 emulator that works quite well on my MacBook Air.\n\nUnfortunately, for Legal Reasons\u2122 I cannot provide a link to the PS2 BIOS or the the game itself, but a cursory Google search should turn up the files you need without too much trouble.\n\nWith these 4 talismans in hand I was able to perform the necessary ritual of resurrection: apply the English patch to the game, boot up the PS2 emulator, load the game.\n\nAfter a few clicks\u2026 paydirt.\n\nAn experienced gamer might find this process mundane, but to me it feels like the internet equivalent of breaking open an ancient, hidden tomb. At this point I could only imagine what treasures may lie within.\n\nWhat I discovered is undoubtedly a work of art, made clear by my time playing this iteration and from Tim\u2019s review of the original. The games also happen to be an example of the billions of bytes of lost media that are just waiting to be rediscovered by someone who will appreciate them.\n\nHere is a game, published 22 years ago, that has managed to evoke feelings of nostalgia and wistfulness in me today, in 2024. This must be the closest thing to time travel I\u2019ll ever experience.\n\nI knew lots about the game before playing due to Tim\u2019s review (which, again, is a 6 hour masterpiece), but there are two aspects I couldn\u2019t fully appreciate until playing: the game\u2019s backgrounds and soundscapes.\n\nFirst, the backgrounds. Bokunatsu makes use of a fixed perspective, where the camera only changes angles when the character moves to another scene. Each area that the user can move through is set upon a\n\nhand-painted background. If you\u2019ve ever seen a Miyazaki film you have a sense for the feelings that these backdrops create. A 3D modeled scene would never have evoked such a strong sense of place, time, and character, and the creative decision to use hand drawn backgrounds makes all the difference.\n\nThere\u2019s a narrative purpose to the backgrounds as well, signaling the time of day as they change throughout between different paintings for day, afternoon, and night.\n\nThe backgrounds were done by artists at an animation studio called Kusanagi.\n\n, but I heartily encourage you to browse through all of the art on their site.\n\nKazuo Oga is a famous background painter and the person responsible for many of the backgrounds in your favorite Miyazaki films.\n\n:\n\nThat\u2019s really the heart of it. Oga notices things \u2014 little things. He gets a feel for them. When he sits down to work, he brings with him all the unimportant details that matter the most. Then, with his paint, he creates an artwork that centers those details, elevates them. It\u2019s more a way of seeing and feeling than it is a technique.\n\nAll the unimportant details that matter the most\u2014paying attention to these details are precisely what make Bokunatsu, from its backgrounds to the narrative itself, so plainly striking.\n\nThe backgrounds are complimented by the soundscapes. These are, in my opinion, the best part of the game.\n\nOf all the characteristics of summer, it may be the sounds which I most associate with the season. I grew up in the rural south, and Bokunatsu manages to capture the droning sounds of summer in a way I\u2019ve never experienced before in media.\n\nAt times, I\u2019ve let the game run in the background just to listen to the soundscapes.\n\n, Sony sent a team into the mountains to capture sounds for the game.\n\nDear reader, I\u2019m here to tell you that the effort paid off.\n\nThe game\u2019s environment is alive with the sounds of insects chirping, the wind blowing through a nearby chime, the trickling of a nearby stream. As Boku explores the countryside time advances and, like the background art, the sounds change to evoke the feeling of morning, afternoon, and night.\n\nAnimal Crossing, which debuted the year after the original Boku no Natsuyasumi game, is held up as the shining example of cozy, relaxing video games. I am a true fan of the Animal Crossing franchise, but with its gameplay literally focused on grinding in order to pay your landlord they stand in stark comparison to a game like Bokunatsu. Animal Crossing rewards completionism, and in doing so makes the game about grinding instead of actually relaxing.\n\nIn comparison, the only thing you\u2019ll get for collecting all of the bugs or catching all of the fish in Boku is a diary entry written by the boy at night before bed. And, like in real life, maybe that\u2019s enough?\n\nDiscovering and playing Bokunatsu (and watching Tim\u2019s 6 hour magnum opus of a review) has given me a deep appreciation for the timelessness of art and media.\n\nA game from 24 years ago, deeply steeped in a culture that isn\u2019t my own, has managed to create in me a sense of warm nostalgia. Its soundscapes remind me of home, but also make me long for a place I\u2019ve never been.\n\nIt\u2019s\u00a0also worth appreciating the meta aspect of the journey I went on to discover and experience this game, all because of a link in a newsletter. This is why the web is so special, and it\u2019s what an AI will never do: unearth a lost gem.\n\nWhen writing in his diary at the end of each in-game day, Boku reflects on \u201cthe most wonderful day in which nothing happened.\u201d Let this be a reminder that there is magic waiting to be found in the mundane."}

So, as you can imagine, I read a\n\nof books, both with my mother and on my own. (I read through the complete unabridged Wizard of Oz series by myself in one summer when I was six.)\n\nI joined my first professional critique group when I was eight; I was told I'd be welcome to join, but they'd expect me to accept the same unvarnished feedback that any grown-up member would get, and to read their work and provide the same sort of honest feedback.

{"url": "https://dev.to/aspittel/what-productivity-looks-like-to-me-5dk5", "origin": "https://dev.to/aspittel", "title": "What Productivity Looks Like to Me - DEV Community", "content": "Posted on\n\n\u2022 Edited on\n\nFirst off, productivity is all about balance. You will not be fully productive if you don't take breaks, don't get enough sleep, or you don't take care of yourself. I do not work all the time whatsoever. I work a very standard 40 hour work week and then do 10-20 hours of side work per week. I do not do it all, I don't work non-stop, I'm not perfect.\n\nI also have a life that allows me to dedicate a lot to my side-work. I live with just my dog, I don't have children, I've been working remote for the last year and a half, and I've been single for most of my time doing side-work. I also am at a place in my career where putting in a 40 hour workweek most weeks at my day job is sufficient. It's a huge privilege that I'm able to be in the position that I am, and I know that my life will shift a lot in the future.\n\nEarly in my career, I worked a lot more than I do now -- I don't even want to do the math on how much, but it was a lot. I didn't have much balance in my life, and I let my social media-life consume me. I wanted to do it all, which wasn't possible. I ended up getting super burnt out, anxious, and unable to be as productive as I wanted to be. Balance is\n\nimportant. I can't overstate that enough. If you're dealing with burnout,\n\nwas a super helpful read to see how bad burnout can really become and how to be more balanced.\n\nI highly prioritize time with friends and family, runs with my dog, reading non-work related books, and being a total foodie in addition to my day job and the company I run. I am more than my work, and I don't want to lose my other identities.\n\nHere are some things that I've learned that help me be my most productive. This will look different for everybody, but I hope some of this is helpful.\n\nFirst off, take care of yourself. Sleeping the optimal amount for you will make you more alert and focused throughout the day. The same thing is true for drinking enough water. I also try to eat protein, fat, and carb balanced meals frequently throughout the day. I run most days and try to do other strength-based workouts too. Plus, I take a spa night on Sundays where I do face and hair masks and teeth whitening.\n\nDon't take health advice from me -- it's not what I do. Still, I do think prioritizing your health is one of the most important things you can do for your productivity and overall well-being.\n\nAs far as scheduling goes, I live by my Google Calendars. I put everything on there - I'm the person that sends my friends GCal invites for every hangout session. Otherwise, I'll forget. It's as simple as that.\n\nI have three calendars, one for my personal life, one for We Learn Code (my company), and one for my day job. Sometimes, I'll forward events to my personal calendar, so they're all in one place. If I'm super overwhelmed, I'll calendar block everything. So, I will have every minute of my day, even free time scheduled in. I don't do this often now, but it used to be really helpful for me to see my schedule upfront.\n\nNote: this was a week where I was in between jobs and had a lot I wanted to get done. I was also on vacation for the second half of the week.\n\nIn order to prioritize what I am going to work on, I first ask myself if it's something I'm passionate about. If it is, then I think about the time commitment and what I\n\nbe able to do if I decided to take on the new task. So, if I were to pick up a new freelance client, I would have to postpone working on an ebook, for example.\n\nMy greater goals and priorities have shifted over time. I initially wanted to build a bigger audience, and the activities I took on were correlated to that. Now, my financial situation has changed a bit, and I rely on my side-work being a larger portion of my income. In the future, I may prioritize more free time, which will change things again!\n\nTo help me prioritize, I use\n\nto track my time spent on every project I do -- not just paid ones. I'm even timing myself writing this post right now. I do this so that I can see where my time goes, which inefficiencies exist, and the payoff of each activity.\n\nFor example, here's my Toggl report for the week I'm writing this. Each of my projects is color-coded, and different views show my hours worked per day and listings of each activity by time.\n\nI also ask myself, \"What are the three most important things for me to get done?\". For my side work, I have three big to-do items for the week. For my day job, I do three per day. I use a pinned Google Keep sticky to keep track of these things, and I have another sticky with any time-sensitive tasks I need to do that day. Mostly things that won't take long, but need to get done then and there. Having just a few essential things to work on helps me to stay focused. I try to only work on what I've set out to do at the beginning of the week. I'm pretty dedicated to getting these few tasks done and worry a lot less about everything else.\n\nI read the book\n\nrecently. It got pretty repetitive at some points, but it does a great job at explaining how to prioritize and why prioritization matters so much. Just do what's essential, nothing more nothing less.\n\nAlso, I do not do it all myself. If there's something that makes sense for me to have someone else do, I will hire a service to handle those tasks. I do wash and fold for my laundry, I used to hire a cleaning service for my apartment, and a large portion of my diet is take-out. I'm in a privileged position to be able to outsource some of these pieces of my life, but it allows me to do more of the work that fires me up: teaching code.\n\nMotivation is also a challenging piece of doing side work, and I'm so imperfect at always being motivated. I give myself lots of breaks, and I remind myself that this I'm choosing to do. I do have some advice for getting and staying motivated.\n\nFirst, I love having groups of friends that I \"mastermind\" with. We inspire each other with our work, commiserate over the hard parts, and discuss strategies for growth. I love working with other people, and working on projects with other people or at least talking to them about those projects is a huge source of motivation for me.\n\nI also utilize the two-minute rule -- if something takes two minutes or less, I just have to get it done. Having one thing crossed off of my to-do list starts the ball rolling, and I usually get more done.\n\nSometimes, I set a timer and timebox how long I'll spend on something -- \"I don't feel like writing right now, but if I spend five minutes on it, I'll be closer to where I want to be.\" I rarely want to stop at the end of those five minutes, but it's a great trick for getting me started on something.\n\nI also am really motivated by finishing things -- leaving them half-done really bothers me. So I usually break tasks into smaller and smaller sub-tasks and focus on completing sub-tasks. This makes me feel more accomplished and like I'm making progress, so I'll be much less likely to abandon the project.\n\nOne of the most difficult things to handle when my social media following grew was the non-stop messages. From people requesting advice to spam to lovely comments about my work, I was all the sudden getting hundreds of communications a day. I receive, on average, 100 mentions on Twitter a day, 15-20 Twitter direct messages, and 50-70 emails. It's a lot.\n\nAt first, I would respond to everything. With a lot of thought and care -- essentially writing personalized blog posts for anyone who asked me a question. It wasn't scalable. I still feel some guilt, but I don't respond to everything anymore. I have so much content that's open to the public, which scales so much better than offering 1:1 advice. I also mute my own tweets after a little while if they get a lot of attention, and I have filters so I don't get any notifications from social media. I do, however, have Tweetdeck set up to show me all mentions and quote tweets so that I can quickly mass respond to people.\n\nI also have a system for my emails. I have three folders in my inboxes: today, this week, and this month. When an email comes in, I delete it or put it in one of these folders. I respond to\n\nemails every weekday,\n\nemails on Mondays, and\n\nemails at the end of the month. I also add emails that will take some time to my to-do list so that I can allot that time better. I'm also really interested in implementing\n\nemail system down the road. It seems awesome, it just takes some time to get used to.\n\nI take notes on\n\n. I take short-term notes that I won't keep forever in\n\n. Then I can archive stickies when I'm done with them. If they're something I want long term, I take notes in markdown and upload them to GitHub. I take notes during meetings I'm in, on books I read, on courses I take, etc. It's good for learning, and it gives me a synthesized version of the material to come back to.\n\nIf I have an idea for a project or a blog post, I write that thought down, otherwise, I'll forget it. I even have a notebook next to my bed for this reason!\n\nRelated to notes, I also have checklists for everything I do -- for blog posts before I publish, for recording Egghead videos, for my morning and evening routines, etc. Making a checklist makes it so I don't have to think, I can refer to the list. I am not very detail-oriented, so having the steps for something written out is so helpful, so I don't forget anything.\n\nMy morning and evening routines are all written in large text on a\n\non my fridge -- even just brushing my teeth is on there! I have my weekly workout schedule and chores list on there too.\n\nFor large projects, I usually use Trello to stay organized and motivated. I'll have checklists for each sub-task on each card. Breaking an enormous task into smaller ones helps me keep motivated and feel like I'm making progress.\n\nI've heard great things about\n\n, a book all about keeping checklists for everything. I haven't read the full text, but reading a summary of it inspired me to start creating these checklists.\n\nIf I can convince you to do one thing after reading this article, it would be to pick up\n\n. This book changed so much for me. Instead of focusing on goals, I try and focus on building up habits that make me who I want to become.\n\nI use\n\nhabit-tracker to keep track of habits I'm trying to build. Some things I have on there include: reading a chapter of a career-focused book each day, drinking enough water, and cleaning my apartment for at least 5 minutes. There's the immediate reward of having the habit change colors after it's completed, and there's an incentive to keep the habit chain going!\n\nAs far as file management goes, I keep everything on Google Drive. That way, if my laptop dies or something, I'll still have a backup. I also only keep files I'm using frequently on my computer to keep that organized. I have folders for projects and for life stuff! I also try to keep my personal and We Learn Code drives separate. Gotta keep work/side-hustle/life balance!\n\nI also keep my browser bookmarks super organized in folders. I only keep things I need, otherwise, I'll save links elsewhere -- like Pinterest or in my notes about something. Bookmarks are for links I frequently come back to. I also have a\n\nfolder filled with articles that I want to read. I try to allocate some time to get through these from time to time too!\n\nI think the term work-life balance is imperfect, but I work to make sure that I'm not working all the time. I'm someone who very much has a tendency to work a huge number of hours and to abandon other aspects of my life and health to do more work. This isn't good, and I actively work to not do this, especially since I have been much more prone to burnout recently.\n\nFirst of all, I don't have work email or Slack on my phone. I only have them on my work computer, which I don't touch outside of work hours.\n\nI also try to make my bedroom a technology-free zone. I will say this is\n\neasier when I'm not working from home -- quarantine has made this pretty much impossible. But, I find I sleep so much better if I put my phone and my computer in my living room before I sleep. I also think having dedicated workspaces when you do work from home is so helpful, and it's something I wish that I could more fully implement in my own life (darn city rent prices!).\n\nI am someone who works best without interruption and with long blocks of time. I don't do well with random 15-minute slots to work, rather I'd prefer to have one long afternoon to work. I used to do all of my blogging from the same restaurant in DC, Busboys and Poets. I'd go there every Sunday afternoon and crank out a post. Having that routine and that long block of time was perfect for me.\n\nI also work best in the afternoon as compared to mornings or nights, though in college, late nights were my everything. I usually do side work immediately after my normal workday ends and on weekend afternoons. Everyone is going to be so different with this -- experiment and find times that work best for you!\n\nI know that the\n\ntechnique works really well for some people, but I work best in long focused blocks. I tend to follow the\n\ninstead. I take breaks when I need to or when I finish a task, but frequent breaks aren't helpful for me, nor do I need them.\n\nSometimes, I have a tendency to get distracted. Especially by social media and the internet more generally. During times like that, I'll use the\n\napp to avoid distracting sites. Sometimes I'll even shut off the internet in my apartment if I really want to get some writing done.\n\nOne additional productivity system I find super helpful is batching. Batching is when you do a bunch of similar activities at once. So, for example, when I did Instagram I would write all my captions for the month at one time, and I'd pre-create graphics and find images. Or when I'm filming videos, I'll do multiple at once. When you're in one headspace it can be optimal to keep doing similar tasks instead of changing your focus to something else.\n\nhas some excellent content on why batching is so great.\n\nMy productivity system is just that --\n\nsystem. Don't feel like you need to adopt all of this or follow any of it. I just hope it's helpful to have a peek into my life and the things that help me. Remember -- balance is\n\nimportant and looks different for everyone. I'm so far from perfect, and I think it can seem like I do so much more than I actually do on social media. I am also in a place in my life where I can spend time on side-work, and I love doing it. Please let me know if you have any questions, or I can answer any questions on\n\n!\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nI'm going to give Toggl a try!\n\nThanks for the article <3\n\nDefinitely use Toggle! I recently started using it and loved it!\n\nsomeone with my style of productivity! Techniques like Pomodoro never made sense to me; I tend to zone into an activity for hours at a time before needing a break. I've been in a quarantine-induced rut lately, so something like Toggl and the \"Flowtime\" technique should definitely help with visualizing my todos day-to-day.\n\nA lot of gems in here. Bookmarking in case I need motivation in the future \ud83d\ude01\n\nVery cool your publication. I really liked Google Keep, it will help me a lot in the division between my school studies and computer technician studies and with my remote repository on GitHub, because sometimes I get very excited, I start coding at 8 am and I stop just for lunch, so I start again and so on until 4 in the morning. I completely forget that I need to study for the entrance exam to enter a university.\n\nI like your thoughts about concentration, reminds me of\n\nprinciples you can find in Cal Newport\u2019s book. I\u2019m just\n\nabout improving as a developer, and I put a big focus on productivity, with one chapter dedicated to deep work :)\n\nGreat article! It seems that you have been working on yourself for a long time and also observing and analyzing all the records and documents too. Just a guess though! I loved many short, sweet, straight but very effective sentences like whatever you have said in the very first paragraph and in the conclusion. Thanks for sharing what has worked for you! Kudos to your efforts... Have a productive day ahead... Keep shining, Keep inspiring \ud83d\ude03\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf8a\n\nHey guys, I have been working on my very first APIs project and in that project I'm making a \"QUIZ APP\", where from an API. I have been taking 10 question and giving them multiple choices and at end they will be getting scored. I'm using NODE.JS, EXPRESS, REQUEST, EJS for the app.\n\nThe problem comes here when i get a string from API. I change it to an object using JSON.parse() and sending it to EJS files and then displayed. but when their are symbols in question like \", ' , and more they are displayed as &139; , \" like that.\n\nAlways interesting to read others' routines. I've recently added kaizen to my workflow, meaning that I look for a small step to improve a process every day. It had the most impact on my personal life so far. For example, yesterday I improved the way I prepare avocado for eating (there's a better way to deal with kernels than what I had been doing). I got the ideas from\n\n.\n\nAnother tool that I use in a similar way to the flowtime technique is RescueTime checking the report from time to time to see in which categories I was working on and how the time was spent.\n\nI have tried Pomodoro technique and I am on the same page as you that I don't need breaks too often. Will try to understand what is Flowtime, thanks for sharing this \ud83d\udc4d\n\nnote taking and scheduling has always seemed as a work itself...\n\ni guess it takes practice to implement it as a daily habit :)\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

I'm an extrovert, and the social environment at work helps to motivate me and get me through the day. That being said, due to COVID and the evolving nature of tech work, I've been working remote for almost two years. There are a lot of benefits to it, like no commute time, the ability to live wherever, more flexibility, and accessibility. Also, I know it's a huge privilege to be able to work remote during this time, and so few of my non-tech friends have that ability. But, for me, working remote doesn't come naturally. So, I wanted to write down my strategies for making it as enjoyable as possible.\n\nI also want to note before starting that right now many of us are working through the stress of a pandemic, shifting to new modalities at work, struggling with economic instability and unemployment, shifting childcare responsibilities, and dealing with health concerns for ourselves and our families. None of this is normal, make sure to take time for yourself and it's okay to not be okay.\n\nThis may sound super corny, but mentally having some sort of \"commute\" to work in the morning and after work in the evening creates some separation in your day. I have a dog, which makes this even easier -- I walk her at the beginning of the day before work and then take her to the park at the end of the day. I also have time to sneak in a bit of a podcast or an audiobook too.\n\nWhen I started working remote, I lived alone. It made work from home really hard because if I didn't actively make plans, I could go days without talking to another human. Earlier this year, I moved in with my partner. Now, I am guaranteed to talk to someone pretty much every day, and I feel much less isolated.\n\nEven if living with another person isn't a reality, having a pet really helps. Having Blair, my dog, makes me get out of the house, and I still have someone with me all day, even if she isn't human. I get cuddles during my breaks, and I even sometimes get a ball thrown at me!\n\nWhen I started working remote, I lived in an apartment that had essentially been my crash pad before. It was in a perfect location, but wasn't very large and was very old -- it didn't even have a real kitchen! I worked out of a desk in my bedroom. So, I was pretty much in that room for 22+ hours a day. It wasn't great for me mentally to not have a separate workspace, and there wasn't much separation between my work and the rest of my life. I know it isn't realistic for everyone, especially those with families or who live in cities with high rent and low square footage, but having a dedicated workspace that you can close off at the end of the day is\n\nand helps you really separate work and the rest of your life.\n\nEarlier this year when the pandemic hit, I lived in a very old studio apartment in NYC, and while it was in the perfect location, it also had a horrible mouse problem, the temperature was always off, and I was pretty much in the same room 24 hours a day. It was miserable.\n\nMoving out of that environment has made working from home much more bearable. Especially since my company has a work from home budget. Getting a comfortable chair, a monitor setup that works for me, and customizations that fit my personality make my workday so much more enjoyable. It has also become a lot more important for me to live in a nice space, and instead of prioritizing living close to work or right downtown, I'm more concerned with living somewhere that's updated, doesn't have a lot of issues, and has space to move around.\n\nEven though I think it's really helpful to have a dedicated workspace, I also move throughout my apartment throughout the day. I do a few hours of work at my desk, then take calls from the couch or the dining room table if I don't need a monitor. It's nice to change the scenery and have a different chair at some point in the day. It helps me re-focus as the day goes on.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of working in an office is the ability to grab or eat lunch with work friends each day. Something I do at least once a week is schedule a lunchtime video call with a friend, whether they are inside of my company or external. It really breaks up the day, recharges me, and keeps those connections intact.\n\nOne of the really nice parts of working remote is that other than calls, you can normally schedule your day to fit your schedule and how you work best rather than being standardized to a 9-5. I often read the advice to always get ready for work. I instead normally put on makeup and get dressed nicely mid-day when I don't have early meetings. I also sometimes take runs during my lunch break, and I often work a 7-3 or 8-4 day instead of 9-5. Use the flexibility to your advantage and work a schedule that fits your needs.\n\nThis is much less relevant now since there's a pandemic going on, but I think it's so important to still socialize with friends and do things outside of your house. It can be tempting to become a hermit since you have to actively leave your house to do things after work, but you still need social interaction and to experience life outside your living space. I find making plans with friends makes me more accountable and likely to do things. Even now, setting up virtual or park hangouts adds some variety to the day!\n\nThis is, again, more of a post-pandemic recommendation, but before COVID I used to do co-working days with friends who also work remote. I would either have them over, or we would meet at a coffee shop and we would work together on each of our work tasks. It's a great opportunity to catch up and have the opportunity to have someone to chat with throughout the day.\n\nOne of the things I miss most about working in an office is unstructured discussion time with colleagues. Most remote calls have a structure and an agenda, but so much valuable brainstorming comes from free-flowing discussions. On past teams, we've scheduled watercooler time or virtual team happy hours, and it's been great to get to know one another and come up with ideas.\n\nEven though most things are remote now, having a community who understands what you do and who you can learn from is so important. I love so many Discord and Slack groups in addition to public forums like DEV and Twitter. They allow me to stay involved with the larger developer community.\n\nRemote work is an increasing piece of work in tech, and I know that it's a really amazing thing for a lot of people, especially parents and those who are disabled. There are many nice pieces of it, like being able to live wherever, no commute times, and the flexibility. That being said, the decrease in work/life separation and the decrease in social time also makes it difficult. Also, this year we aren't just working remote, we are working during a pandemic -- and many people have additional responsibilities as a result. I hope these tips are helpful!\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nI think it's a very important article! Not everyone will be naturally prone to working remote. One thing I have been thinking about lately is how to foster a remote company culture that is actually fun to work in? Remote video calls are good but there's no substitute for face to face interactions (yet). In the remote community there's been so much focus on co-workers who don't like each other and they are forced into an office, watercooler drama, etc. but what about if the co-workers are kickass and it's a genuine fun experience to interact.\n\nalso I was wondering: how to make remote video lunches not turn into some kind of weird live ASMR session ? \ud83e\udd23\n\nYeah I guess everything has pros and cons. Personally I like remote work, even before everyone was forced to. So I already made sure my work space is very nice.\n\nI think it's important to be disciplined and be good at planning if you work from home, otherwise there is no routine and boundaries. Also, for parents I think it's extra challenge, especially if they have limited space. But perhaps WFH also allows people to move to suburb or smaller and less expensive city/town, so they can actually afford better living standard.\n\nAnyone have a link to that wallpaper \ud83d\udc40\n\nYes!\n\nThank you!! \ud83d\udc95\n\nExcellent advice. I've done a lot of these same things for most of my career (which has been 95% WFH self-employment).\n\nI will add, I suggest finding a group of friends that can do social time on video calls of some kind. I've been seriously considering an early morning \"Coffe with Seth\" type stuff to give other early birds like me someone to chit chat with about work stuff, or to just shoot the breeze at a regularly scheduled time.\n\nI've actually found myself really engaged with streamers when I never was before. That can be a lot of fun to find a small streamer and get to interact with whatever they are doing. I enjoy being helpful when I can.\n\nThanks for this post! Although I am not an extrovert, I\u2019m way on the opposite end it is important to be mindful of how we are spending our days now. It\u2019s been a real balance trying to make sure I stay healthy mentally and not fall into becoming a hermit. I have resorted to forming a pod with basically my partner and housemates and that has been super helpful to stay active.\n\nis that 13\" mac comfortable to work for you? I previously tried to work on it on a previous job, but without an external monitor it was horrible, such a small screen to work. Never considered a 16\" instead of this one? Or mobility is your top priority there?\n\nGreat post Ali\n\nThanks for this!! Having a separate place to work and pets really help\n\nYES, I agree with all those great ideas.\n\nMy FAV; Get out of the house! Feeling pent up? For people with yards or front porches, just sit outside for 5 minutes. Get that Vitamin D!\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

In a recent\n\n, we discussed computer science degrees, bootcamps, and self-directed learning. Each has benefits and have brought a lot of people into the world of programming. Each also has challenges. All four of us have had unique paths to programming, so here are our stories.\n\nI was a biology major in college and then quickly realized that I was terrible at it. So, I switched to actuarial science where I took an intro to computer science course and totally fell in love with binary, hexadecimal, and octal systems. The rest is really history. I studied computer science and my first language was Java. I was a little bit of a late bloomer but I thoroughly enjoy it.\n\nI got started when I was 11 years old. I wanted to build my own community on Neopets. If you\u2019re not familiar with what Neopets is, it\u2019s this Web site where you can have your own virtual pet and you can feed it and play games. You can have your own communities and all kinds of stuff.\n\nI really wanted to build my own community and customize it. But you need to know how to code to do that. So, I asked my dad for an HTML book and my first book was HTML goodies. I thought it was awesome and a lot of fun.\n\nFast forward to high school, and I took AP Computer Science. My first language in high school was Java, and I was so bad at it that I needed a tutor just to pass the class. I was like \"I\u2019m never going to do this ever.\" But, you know, obviously, 17 years later and I\u2019m very clearly still coding, so something eventually clicked but it wasn\u2019t Java.\n\nI was an admin assistant really aimlessly going through my job; I was miserable. My dad suggested coding to me and was like \"worst case scenario if you hate it you could try something else.\"\n\nSo, he bought me an \u201dIntroduction to Drupal\u201d book and \u2013 quite frankly, I do not recommend starting out as Drupal when you\u2019re learning to code but that\u2019s how I did. I just continue learning, continue working in the mornings before work. Then I got my first Drupal job.\n\nA few years into that I started learning about accessibility. Then a year or so after that I started learning about React and VueJS and I\u2019m now a React developer and the rest is kind of history.\n\nI learned to code when I was a sophomore in college. I had no idea what coding even was, but I had an extra course block available. I decided to sign up for it because people kept telling me, \u201dIt\u2019s a good thing to learn and it\u2019ll help you no matter what.\u201d\n\nI honestly thought that I was going to be learning how to format Word documents or something like that - I had no idea what code was. But, I was instead writing Python. It was super fun: we were building games. I just thought it was magical how you could put stuff together and have a program come out of it.\n\nI completely reconfigured my schedule and was like I\u2019m going to double major in computer science, this is my future. So, I started my second class which was in C++ and it was a super intense \"Data Structures and Algorithms\" class, which was also a weed out class. I was pulling all-nighters and working so hard in that class just to understand it. I did come out of it with a good grade. I thought \"if I have to work this hard for it, it means that I\u2019m not good enough at it. This is really just not for me.\"\n\nThen when I was a Junior in college I had an internship doing mostly Excel data analysis type work, and I figured out that I could automate a lot of my own job using the Python skills that I had. So, from there, I got a software engineering internship and transitioned to working full time in code.\n\nYou can listen to the\n\nwhere we discussed our thoughts on bootcamps, computer science degrees, and self-directed learning as well as advice for everyone in the midst of their journies.\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nI love origin stories!\n\nI think the major takeaway is that it doesn't matter how you get started - just get started, and keep going.  Each of your backgrounds is so different; it's a testament to the fact that there is no one 'right' way to get started.  Just find something you like doing - and keep doing that.\n\nThanks for sharing!\n\nI love hearing \"where did you fell in love with computers\" stories \ud83e\udd29\n\nKeep rocking!\n\nLoved Lindsey\u2019s story, my first job was as a Drupal developer! I feel your pain. Love this.\n\nStrong women \ud83d\udcaa\n\ndoes it have a caption? I knew it's excessive asking...\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

{"url": "https://dev.to/ladybug/thoughts-on-being-a-digital-nomad-55i6", "origin": "https://dev.to/aspittel", "title": "Thoughts on Being a Digital Nomad - DEV Community", "content": "Posted on\n\n\u2022 Originally published at\n\nAlmost two years ago, I donated almost everything I owned and left DC. I was at a job that wasn't the right fit for me, and I didn't know my future. I decided that rather than signing a new lease, I'd instead mostly live at tech conferences for the summer and crash at my parents' in between, and then start living out of AirBnBs in the Fall. I ended up retiring from the digital nomad lifestyle in order to work in an office gain (which started 3 days before the COVID shutdown \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f). That being said, I think this is a pretty unique experience, but more people may be able to do the same as remote work becomes more popular and (hopefully) the pandemic starts to subside. So, I wanted to write down my thoughts and advice on the experience.\n\nI personally chose to live out of AirBnBs. The longer you book a place, the more discount you get normally. So, I'd book a place for a month at a time. The cost for AirBnB pluses ended up being less than my DC rent most months. The van life idea is so appealing to me, but the mechanical knowledge needed and the potential lack of internet intimidates me. I also personally stayed in the United States because of my dog, I didn't want to quarantine her which you need to do with most international countries.\n\nI travelled from city to city in my car, which was super nice. I was able to visit a bunch of sites nearby cities instead of just staying downtown, which I may have had to without a car.\n\nI chose cities by expense, activities available, and their proximity to National Parks. My biggest bucket list item is to visit all of the National Parks, so this very much helped in that goal. I loved being able to experience different areas, taste test different restaurants, and to never get bored of my surroundings. I also was using it as a way to vet cities before settling down -- I didn't know where I wanted to move longterm, so this was a way of trying out different cities.\n\nTaxes can get\n\ncomplicated if you're moving around a bunch, especially if you move internationally or are self-employed (or just have side gigs like me). I hired an accountant who specializes in digital nomads, and it's such a weight off my chest.\n\nis his site in case you're interested.\n\nThere were two really difficult attributes of travel for me: the first was loneliness, the second was the lack of a routine. It's pretty tough to get to know people when you aren't staying in a city for long. Something I would probably prioritize if I did this again would be to go to cities with a big tech scene so I could go to meetups and potentially speak at them. I was also single at the time, so doing this with a partner or a family would probably help in that regard. As far as having a routine, I was changing where I lived every month. So it's difficult to get too settled. Part of that was nice, I would go on hikes every morning with my dog in Asheville and would go to a neighborhood coffee shop in Nashville. But, I definitely missed having a set workday schedule.\n\nOverall, it's an experience I really enjoyed and would highly recommend if your work and life situations allow it. I would probably go back to being a digital nomad once the country re-opens and my partner was able to work remote. If you're interested in moving internationally,\n\nthis Ladybug episode. Please\n\nany questions to me, I'd love to help out!\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nThis is exactly what I would like to do but kinda afraid to take the plunge. I too had a plan to visit different cities and just go to tech conferences and meetups but I\u2019m unsure if I should without a car and use public transport or not. Also I am a freelancer so it\u2019s feast or famine when it comes to money.\n\nCosmic timing Ali ! I\u2019m about to do this my self.. I\u2019ve been at a job that allows me to do this for about a year now , and my lease is up in July , so as soon as it is , I want to sell all my stuff and do it while I\u2019m still single and not having kids\n\nThank you so much for the heads up , in regards to loneliness and lack of routing - being a creature of habit I think I too would seriously miss this aspect Of everyday existence the most  ...\n\nPerHaps if I stayed longer than a month , like at least 3 at a time , it would enough to feel settled in .\n\nAnd to combat loneliness - I am pretty violently extroverted and usually end up making friends wherever I go .. just difficult when they don\u2019t speak English .\n\nAwesome! Yeah, hopefully by then things will be more open and you can go to events. I think that will be really helpful :)\n\nReally cool to share this experience! I would love to do something similar in Europe but am always a bit scared about the lack of routine and how hard would it be to meet people and build relationships in short term.\n\nThis post inspired me though! Thank you\n\nWhat if you are planning this in the country where you live right now.?\n\nI would be less scared if I plan it \"smaller\".\n\nAnd probably you already will get some good experience and confidence to do it in the whole Europe.\n\nThat is also a valid idea :) I am living in Austria currently, so small country if compared to where I come from, but still there are other cities where would be cool to live for a while!\n\nNeat! Thanks for sharing, especially the accountant bit!\n\nWe plan to launch in 2023. I joined a community called\n\nlast year, and I'll be keeping my membership up until the big day because there is just so much to learn! There are people in this community that do it with AirBnB like you. One of the other benefits is the private small groups in the community, such as the one for IT Professionals.\n\nStarlink will be in full swing by then, so hopefully we'll be more connected than ever so that we can be more disconnected than ever. Wrap your mind around that!\n\nOne of the things you said really stood out to me, and that was your comment about DC rent. In Annapolis we are are shelling out $3,700 a month between childcare and rent, and I didn't know how well that would prepare me for places like Norway which famously costs you about $25-35 dollars for fish and chips and a pint. Cool, we do that, too!\n\nIt comes up a lot in the group, because there is someone experiencing the digital nomad life at every level from financially independent to the most frugal families you've ever met. The first question I asked was whether or not I was ridiculous for wanting a 5th wheel for the three of us when there are people cramming 12 into a vintage Airstream, and I found that it's all about what is comfortable for you. It set me at ease. This is going to be our home for a few years while we are roadschooling/unschooling, after all.\n\nOh, and national parks are high on our list, too. \ud83d\ude04 I want to fill out one of the passports.\n\nWow, that sounds awesome!\n\nI consider every now and then to \"travel\" around the UK.\n\nAs I am not working in IT yet, my plan is/was to apply a global company which has stores around the country, so I can transfer myself between stores/businesses.  So, I would spend 2-5 months in each city on my list, keep working so I have income and the same time I explore everything in my free time.\n\nAs I came from another country without partner or family member, I already have experience how to spend my free time without feeling alone or lonely.\n\nThere are some really cool meetups and activity groups around the country which I would love to visit.\n\nWhat a cool goal you had! Staying nearby National Parks! If the possibility to work remotely stays in my company, I'd also consider moving closer to the mountains.\n\nThanks for sharing, Ali! I'm planning to be a digital nomad from next year first locally (in my country) and then internationally for the next few years.\n\nIt sounds exciting. Where would you like to go? Which cities are on your list?\n\nWe are planning to do the same next year, but go around Europe and Asia - I will document our adventures as digital nomads :)\n\nWhat a wonderful way to work, Id welcome the private time and time for me. That sounds like a bucket list item I may need to add.\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

Writing articles; making videos; released my first course early this year :D\n\nI want to be what I am now...\n\n...but perhaps making enough money to survive. :)\n\nTo summarize, I'm a writer, programmer, cook, interviewer, poet, musician, masseur, coach, speaker, and more. I've got a million projects on the go at all times. I traded stability for chaos, and I love it, except for the financial part now.\n\nI don't mix with grown up careers well. :)\n\nThat is so freaking cool -- sounds like a dream to be able to combine all of your interests! I'm sure you'll figure out the income part -- you are so talented at so much!\n\nReally\n\nHow can one be all this things\n\nYou try to juggle. Many things will fall and break. But you keep adding more. Eventually some things will stay in the air.\n\nI want to be a person who is present for the ones that I love. I've been thinking about this a lot lately. There are so many elements to that goal: health, financial stability, work-life balance, etc.\n\nI can relate to that very much. And it\u2019s not easy to balance the factors, I feel.\n\nI also want to be who I am suppose to be. Though my description of \"who I suppose to be\" is different from what people expect of me.\n\nI want to be close to my family, friends and who I see important.\n\nTo point to a semi-fictional archetype I would be happy to aspire to:\n\nBrad Pitt's character in The Big Short.\n\nThis is probably odd because it is really a sad story full of sad people and Pitt's character may be the most honestly sad of all (sad in terms of emotions).\n\nHopefully I can accomplish this while staying happy and optimistic, but that character really understood how the world worked, he lived in a beautiful mountainous location and was there for mentees when they needed him (even if he was a bit grumpy along the way).\n\nWhen designing my\n\n, I think about that character. I can tell I am going in that direction and I hope I can continue to achieve the good parts of that situation.\n\nAlong these lines, I really appreciated this post:\n\nWe humans must find a certain contentment in whatever situation we find ourselves in, but in terms of situations to position one's self to be in. This is my line of thinking. \ud83d\ude42\n\nLoved that article, really thoughtful... Thanks Ben!\n\nWould you mind sharing the results of the last six months of your experience after commenting on the article?\n\nWhen I was around 12-13 I always imagined myself at 25 with my own apartment, at the pool with a margarita. I'm 26 and I don't have any of that ; ----;\n\nBut I still want to grow up into that image, but with the added bonus that the pool and apartment are in my personal island. B3\n\nI'm about to turn 28 and am in same position...no house, credit is a dumpster fire (but have a subprime auto loan on a badass sports car!) and I'm watching all my friends get married and settle down with kids and I am nowhere near any of that...I just keep hoping one of my random startup ideas finally pans out and I can sell out and live a more stable life...maybe next year\n\nWhat did I want to be (before the harsh realities of life)?\n\n...A meteorologist. (Damn you university calculus for crushing the dream!)\n\nToday, what do I want to be when I \"grow up\" (aka retire)?\n\nI'd like to buy a mini-excavator and dig holes for pocket money! :)\n\nI want to enjoy a more balanced life and have more saying in what i put my time and energy into. That means, being part of a team that creates and sustains something actually useful and having my free time and enjoying life more.\n\nI love this idea, maybe call it 'caffeine commit'\n\nI just wanna simply sit somewhere watching my family having fun\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

It was a nice sunny day, hopped on the early 7:45 train to Hope,\n\n. Little did I know that was the start of my new hobby and passion, hiking; as I recently went to Peak District again, done\n\nand the\n\ntrails. More on this down bellow.\n\nI tried to cover the most important aspects of my trip, but hiking is all about the moment and the experience. Hard to put into words the beauty of nature.\n\nBy far the best thing about going away from the day to day city craze, was the silence. After the train left the station, all I could hear was \u2026 nothing. Pure silence. It then occurred to me, that I have\n\nsomething, in a very long time. I had forgotten what silence was; the pure tranquility sensation.\n\nOn the first Hike, I did the climb to Ladybower Dam and got to see quite a bit of nature, the rural areas around Hope and saw how friendly outdoorsy people are. Everyone would salute you and people were more than eager to give directions and help you.\n\nAfter the rather easy hike to the dam, I went up to Win hill, where the view was very rewarding, as the climb is on some steep rocks trough a forested area with a stream of water on the side. From the peak you could see all around the valley and could even see the dam. The walk back down was much easier and quicker as it followed a path down and around the hill instead of climbing rocks.\n\nI would say that the first hiking experience wasn\u2019t that eventful, but nonetheless it was a special moment and the start of something beautiful.\n\nThis took place mid October on a cloudy day with some light rain. The hike was considerably longer than the first one (10km), and this time it involved walking across the peaks of Loose Hill. The view was nice, but due to the clouds and fog, visibility was limited.\n\nThe best part of this hike was the end destination, and what would end up becoming my new post-hike\n\n.\n\nA nice cozy place, right next to Edale Station. The staff there are like a big family, they\u2019re friendly and warm. The decor of the restaurant is homy and the food is just what you need after a long hike. On Sunday they have roast (pork or beef) with veggies and Yorkshire pudding. They also sell local ales (which are some of the best and most refreshing beers I\u2019ve had). To get an idea of how good the beer is, I asked if they sell bottles of the stuff (sadly no), so next time I\u2019ll see if I can bring my own bottle \ud83c\udf7a.\n\nThey are welcoming people, \u201cmuddy boots are welcome\u201d and \u201cdogs are welcome\u201d.\n\nLast weekend I spontaneously decided to go hiking again. I simply craved it, weather was good (by UK standards) and train tickets were still cheap. So I did it. Since my last hike I even invested in a hydration pack and some light, foldable, and strong hiking poles (which came in handy!).\n\nThe hike started off with a superb walk above a brook, trees with red, orange and yellow leaves, you get to cross a couple of rustic looking wooden bridges. The brooks valley even gets narrower and the hills on both sides are quite steep, giving an amazing feel when walking between em.\n\nAbout 2km in, the hike transforms into a little bit of a climb. The path becomes one with the brook and you have to carefully navigate your way from rock to rock on the brook. Then the elevation begins to take off, you start climbing up some rocks, with the brook still there. Making this a treacherous climb where one must be very confident in every move. The climb is about 1km with an elevation gain of 500m. For me that\u2019s the steepest path I had to take so far, but the climb is full of breathtaking scenery and as you go higher you get to see more and more of where you came from.\n\nUpon reaching the peak, you realise it\u2019s actually a plateau and you can see the entire valley where you walked. A little further in, most people will proceed to climb to an even higher peak, but not me. My trail map said\n\nand so I did.\n\nWhat was I expecting? From the map, I knew the trail would pass trough the\n\n. I expected a nice area, abundant in vegetation and tall trees, you know\n\n.\n\nWhat did I get?\n\nThe path I followed (at this point alone, as everybody else would go in the opposite direction) was next to a water stream and as such the ground was rather muddy and soft. Then the trail map said\n\nand so I did. After a while I found myself in a rather muddy area, with no visible path and no obvious direction to follow. The sun was still out and I was about 1/3 of the trail in so I pushed forward.\n\nAfter a kilometre of walking trough some rather shitty conditions (mud and weird terrain), fog set in out of a sudden; combined with the lack of a path and the only direction I knew being\n\n, I pushed on like any sane person would do.\n\nNot 5 minutes later I was in the middle of a post-apocalyptic scenario. Fog everywhere, terrain at this point was composed of\n\ncombined with\n\nand\n\n.\n\nThis is when it hit me. I am in a swamp.\n\nThere were many questions going on in my head at the time:\n\nI realised that I might not have the time (sunset was 2-3 hours away) to juggle around the terrain of the swamp, so I took a split second decision and I started going\n\nin the hopes of intersecting with the public footpath sooner rather than later.\n\nAfter adventuring trough the swamp like a mad man, trying to reach some solid ground. Getting mud all over my boots and pants, finding a rather suspicious metal box under some rocks and getting bad looks from frogs, I eventually got out of the fog, away from the mud and reached the Pennine footpath where I slowly walked my way back to Edale.\n\nIt was definitely an experience that I will not forget. And honestly I would do it again, this time going trough the entire swamp and maybe even see\n\n.\n\nI didn\u2019t cover the entire trip, there were other sights to see, like Jacob\u2019s ladder and the High Peak area.\n\nMore hiking stories to come (with full HD videos of the entire trip)."}

I hacked into their computer and captured the USB traffic on it. Could you help me steal the secret?\n\nFlag format: flag{0-9a-z_} (Convert uppercase to lowercase)\n\nAttachments:\n\nFor this challenge, we are given a pcapng that contains USB protocol packets.\n\nMost of the packets are input packets labeled as\n\nby wireshark. There are, however, a few exceptions:\n\nThis packet and the one below it caught my attention because they are both output packets and contains ascii characters that resemble some sort of programming language.\n\nI copied one of the lines and did a quick google search.\n\nis what I found - a TSPL/TSPL2 Programming Language manual. Just like how 3d printers are controlled using G-code, it seems like that printers also have their own programming language.\n\nHere are the commands within the two packets:\n\nThe second packet seems to be the one that actually draws out the flag using two different commands:\n\nand\n\n. Now, I just have to implement the two commands in python and get the flag.\n\nHere is the code for that:\n\nIn the end, we get an image with the flag:\n\nflag:\n\nwho likes singing, dancing, rapping and shell-coding?\n\nThe directories on the server looks something like this:\n\nnc 139.180.215.222 20002\n\nnc 106.52.252.82 20002\n\nAttachments:\n\nAfter a quick analysis of the binary given, we see that the binary reads in 7 bytes of data, zero out most of the registers, and executes the data as shellcode.\n\n7-byte is not a lot. The\n\ninstruction itself takes up 2 bytes. Due to this size limitation, I decided to go with a two-stage approach. First, I will craft a 7-byte payload that will make a read syscall and read in a second stage payload. Second, I will craft a second stage payload that is more than 7 bytes and perform whatever task I want without worrying about any size limitations.\n\nI ran the binary in gdb just to see the state of the registers when our shellcode is being called. This is helpful as it allows us to utilize some of the existing register values:\n\nAs you can see, there\u2019s not a lot to work with, but we do have the address of the current buffer loaded in rdi.\n\nIn order to make the read syscall, we need four things:\n\nWe know that the syscall itself takes up 2 bytes and copying the address of the current buffer from rdi to rsi takes at least 2 bytes. This leaves us 3 bytes to zero out rdi and make rdx a large number:\n\nMy first idea was to move the address of the current buffer to rdx as it is quite a large number; however, it turns out to be too large and would not work.\n\nLooking for inspiration, I came across\n\n. Although it is written for 32 bit instead of 64 bit, it is still quite useful and helped me came up with my final payload:\n\nThis payload only uses 6 bytes of space! It relayed on the fact that\n\nis a single byte instruction, and due to its 32 bit nature, the current address is truncated to only 4 bytes before being loaded into rdx.\n\nNow, we successfully bypassed the size limitation and can run whatever code we want; however, the execve syscall seems to be blocked on the server. Bummer!\n\nBut we can still do an open/read/write to get the flag right? Well, now is a good time to review the challenge description:\n\nThe directories on the server looks something like this:\n\nAs you can see, the flag is hidden in a nested folder, and we need a way to find the path for the flag file.\n\nBasically, we need a way to list the content in a given directory. The first thing that came to me was the\n\ncommand, so I ran a strace on it:\n\nAll that we need is two syscalls:\n\nwhich opens a file descriptor for a given path and\n\nwhich list out the content of a directory.\n\nWith the help of the shellcraft module in pwntools, I quickly created a payload that can read out the content of a given directory:\n\nAnother minor inconvenience is the fact that the\n\nsyscall returns a linux_dirent struct for each file which needs to be parsed. Lucky, we can do that on the client side with python instead of parsing it with assembly:\n\nNow, with the ability to list all files in a given directory, we just need a program to recursively go through all the folders and find the flag file.\n\nBecause the server always timeouts before the flag file can be found, I also added the functionality to preserve progress so that I can get the path using multiple sessions.\n\nHere is the final code:\n\nWith this code, I found the flag file located at\n\n.\n\nNow with a simple payload, we can read out the flag:\n\nflag:"}

Not many Romanians know about it. It\u2019s more of a regional thing. The people who would cook and eat \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie used to be shepherds. It\u2019s also possible that other cultures have a similar dish but I haven\u2019t yet met someone from outside my family that can describe anything similar to \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie.\n\n\u021a\u0103c\u0103lie is rich in calories and fat and it\u2019s best served hot. The caloric value it offers is extremely important for people like shepherds because of the long hours on the cold mountains. The ingredients and method of making \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie are also accessible. All they\u2019d have to do is carry a chunk of pig fat, some bread and an onion, then make a little fire.\n\nFor me \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie used to be a normal thing, whenever we\u2019d have a family BBQ, \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie was the first thing we made. I really enjoyed it as a kid and took years to learn the proper way of cooking it. Anybody can easily cook \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie but it takes multiple attempts to get all the little details right and perfect your method. This will only lead to the best of \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie, so well cooked that angles will weep for a taste of it.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until high school and talking with some friends that I realised I am the only one who knows about \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie.\n\nI cooked some \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie for some friends of mine and some couldn\u2019t even dare taste it. For some it is\n\nextremely heavy (you\u2019ll understand why shortly).\n\nWarning: Vegans and vegetarians will flee when exposed to \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie\n\n(pig fat with rind, Romanians call it\n\n)\n\nFor cooking you\u2019ll also need a stick (size matters, anything between 30-50cm should be good enough). Make sure the stick is strong enough to hold the chunk of pig fat and not too dry (spoiler alert, it all goes above a fire).\n\nWarning: Do not use a metal stick, the pig fat will slide right out after heating up. I recommend a cherry tree branch with a sharpened tip.\n\nTo get things started slightly cut your pig fat on all sides (excluding the skin side). Do not make the cuts too deep, as it could make it fall apart later. We do this to allow for better and more evenly cooking.\n\nNow cut the bread (slices, about 1cm thick, you can do thicker slices if you feel \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie is too heavy for you) and onion (any shape or size you like, I prefer rings). Place the onions slices/rings on the slices of bread and set everything near your grill.\n\nAt this point you should start your fire. Do not let the flame burn out, \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie is cooked using the flame not active charcoal. Take your stick and put the tip of it inside the fire (enough to chahr it, but don\u2019t set it on fire). Stick your chunk of pig fat on the stick.\n\nThis bit might sound easy but it\u2019s quite tricky to get it right. At this point you should have your chunk of slan\u0103 on the stick, your fire is roaring and the bread with onions is nearby.\n\nRepeat this process until each slice is covered in as much fat as you wish (see final product bellow for reference).\n\nTip: You can use some of the dripping fat to keep the fire alive or to extend it to new sections of the BBQ, thus ensuring you equally activate your charcoal.\n\nTip: When dripping fat on the bread, feel free to slowly and gently press the slan\u0103 on the bread.\n\nMaster tip: Sometimes the tip of your stick will set on fire.\n\n, this is the best thing that could happen but be careful. You can now tilt your stick with the tip facing almost completely down. Keep the stick above the bread and watch how the tiny flame will make the pig fat drip.\n\nAfter doing the above\n\na couple of times you will notice the exterior of the pig fat is cooked, at this point set it near your bread and start cutting the outer layer, revealing more raw uncooked pig fat ready for roasting.\n\nThe cooked fat is placed on top of the bread for added unhealthy pure tastiness.\n\nTip: At the point when you start cutting the first layer of cooked slan\u0103, you might want to take a short break and eat a slice, as \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie is best served hot. Reheating it is an option.\n\nNote: After cutting outer layers, make sure to make some more cuts on the surface to allow for more fat dripping and better roasting.\n\nAgain, repeat the above until all pig fat is cooked. Depending on the rind you have, it may be easy to bite trough and crunchy or extremely tough. It is comestible tho and I personally enjoy it.\n\nThis is how the final product should look like:\n\nIf you weren\u2019t disgusted by possibly the most unhealthy edible thing you\u2019ve ever heard, then you should know a couple of things."}

But, for some, maybe being able to stick to the timeline might just be the fun that is added to life. Being able to sleep on time and wake up a fresh man every other day is just what you find fun in.

It all started back in mid-2013 when my twitter stream and facebook newsfeed was filled with status-es like \u201cIt\u2019s official, you\u2019re invited! Yay!\u201d and there in my mailbox was an unread email with the same subject. Yes, It was official and I was invited too :D. It was an invitation to attend the Mozilla Summit 2013 to be hosted simulatneously in 3 cities (Brussels, Toronto and Santa-Clara) and with the mission for (almost) all mozillians to come together, get inspired, talk and shape the future of the open web.\n\nFast forward to October 2013, after a flight from Munich via Amsterdam, I was standing in front of the Brussles airport, there were the amazing summit volunteers waiting to greet mozillians and make sure we reach the right hotel. I checked into the hotel, went to the square to grab dinner/snacks and the awesome goodie bag. Next stop was the Delirium Cafe (also known for having the guiness world record for the most variety of beer in 2004) where i met a lot of awesome mozillians.\n\nOver the next couple(+1) of days i attended sessions related to privacy on the web (where we discussed about ghostery and collusion- now knows as Lightbeam), using the developer tools to debug other XUL based applications (especially thunderbird), Mozilla Reps program, MDN, OpenBadges, having a million mozillians. One thing that i liked about each session is that it was a two way session and it included more discussions and less of one way communication.\n\nOther than the sessions, I think the world fair and the innovation fair were the two awesome places to be in the summit as it gave one an opportunity to see how spread we are as mozillians and how awesome we are too.\n\nWell, you attended an event - AWESOME, but what you take away from the event decides how successful it was and how it would help you in the coming days. Here\u2019s what i got to takeaway.\n - Getting to know some of the faces behing the IRC nicks, turns out i couldnt\u2019 meet all the faces\n - Meeting the mozillians from Europe. I would like to give a special shout out to Axel Grude (the awesome AMO guru), Raivis (The Latvian mozillian, localizer, webdev, awesome!), Rimas (localizer, techie from Lithuania) and Sjmur (Mozilla ireland community manager).\n - A week after the summit and i had already helped Axel test(and find a bug too) one of his\n\nand made it to his contributor list.\n - Last but not the least, leaving with the motivation to do more and the feeling that your work is making a difference.\n\nAnother mail, another set of flights and here I am in London, Running to the Mozilla office directly from the airport to attend a reps meeting session regarding the Mozilla Festival. Oh, did i say that this was the biggest MozFest till date. This was quite a different event from other Mozilla events, because of the new set of audience and the new set of motivation. The Mozilla Festival is all about building and hacking, as they say (F*ck it, Ship it).\n\nThe first day of the event officially started with the science fair at the evening, leaving us (as facilitators) a whole day to get an idea of the flow of the event and our role in it. Me and Prashish were part a of the scrum led by Kat and Laura, where we had a wall full of problems and an army of awesome-scurm-leads (More on the scrum later). Then we had the hack-your-tshirt session where we hacked our tshirts with spray paint and sketch-pens. The event had a mega version of it with paints and what not (more on that later). Then, kicked off the real deal of the day, the Science festival. There were some awesome projects, experiments and products being displayed but i would like to give a special mention to goolabs (for their awesome work with 3d on the web), Erase all kittens(for how awesome+weird+different their approach to teaching and gaming is) and the tactile web demo from the Mozilla Japan team (believe me they were awesome)\n\nThe Day 2 kicked off with the keynotes and then moving to the track they belonged to. I first went to the #teachTheWeb track, as we were part of that track. There was a beautiful wall of\n\nwaiting to be in the making and be made eventually :D . Then i went to the openbadges section to hack on some custom badges and badges of the future. While browsing other badges i was way inspired by the\n\n. Then came the most important and happening event of the day, the Maker-Party. I am so glad that i didnt miss it, because the aurora and the spirit at the maker party was amazing (more than that). People working on stop-motion-videos, children learning to code, people making games using scratch, making (the so sweet)kumi dolls, and a lot more (there were so many things happening that i might have forgot some). That was most of the first day which ended with some awesome conversations with Henrik, Jan, Prashishh, Michael and Leo over the course of Japanese food.\n\nThe third day was mostly similar with attending more awesome sessions, meeting more awesome people, painting some more t-shirts :P and learning more intriguing ways to teach and engage people.\n\nI think the biggest takeaway from this event was how important learning is and how big a role the teacher/teaching method plays in the process. I personally learned a variety of different ways people were using to teach webmaking and moreover dozens of ways people were using the web to make things. Again, a big shout out to all the Mozilla Reps (you all are awesome), It was a great pleasure meeting each one of you.\n\nWell, I wanted to especially thank the Mozilla Nepal community (especially Avash for taking the lead initially), and the people behind the first Mozilla South Asian Meetup, where i got to meet all the community leaders (especially Deb, who is my mentor too) who eventually guided me and helped me to contribute."}

Its raining cats and dogs. Actually, It\u2019s been raining non stop for the last 2 nights. The streets are flooded and the very little traffic that is out this stormy morning is being re-routed in multiple places. I am wondering how today will go.\n\n-\nSeveral of the organizing team reach the venue. We are setting up the venue, but there is a cloud of uncertainity. The rain is not something that we had factored in our planning.\n\n-\nI get a message \u201cAvinash, I believe you should consider cancelling today.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a thought that has already cross our minds. There\u2019s news of flood in several locations of Kathmandu. Several landslides have been reported. But we also had a commitment to everyone who registered. Even if just five people showed up, we felt we owed it to them to keep the show running. And that\u2019s exactly what we were going to do.\n\n- The first group of attendees show up. We were not expecting people to show up on time, let alone at all. This was the first motivation we needed for the day.\n\n-  A few more trickled in, and by now we had around 40 people. Not bad, right? Enough for a party. A BarCamp Party.\n\nBy the end of the day we had:\n\nSome fun facts:\n\nAll in all, I am really happy with the event and how it turned out. We (as wwktm) haven\u2019t had organized an event since covid, so getting back on the \u201corganizing\u201d wheel took quite a lot of effort, But in the end, I think we pulled it off.\n\nFor next time, though, if there\u2019s a BarCamp again [1], we\u2019ll definitely plan earlier and budget better. The ticket prices were kept low this time, and unfortunately, we ended up with a few financial losses. But I\u2019d like to think of it as an investment in future events rather than a loss.\n\n[1] Let me know what you thought about the event. Your feedback helps us improve and motivates us to keep going.\n\nUntil then,\n\nBe nice to everyone :D"}

Nothing has changed in the once peaceful country. That peaceful country where people are fighting; They are divided, divided by caste, divided by religion, divided by color, divided by reason, divided without any reason. Fight all day long, fight for your ego, fight for the fake pride and then in the end of the day take pride in being the most peaceful country in the world, take pride in being the most peaceful people, take pride in coming from the land of Buddha. Great, at least we are the quintessential hypocrites.\n\nIt\u2019s sad to see the leaders fighting like children. Oh come on, we had fairer fights when we were kids. It\u2019s funny to see the parties organize a meeting with the other parties, and follow it with their own personal meetings; its clear they have no philosophy, no pride, no compassion, all they want is to maximize their profits. This child play has been the norm in one way; it has pulled everyone centuries behind. Centuries behind in thinking, in science, in contribution to society.\n\nThe smart world is working on nurturing the future generation. We? we have already lost them, we have failed them. Those kids should be studying in school, challenging their teachers, learning from their mentors, painting, drawing and solving that random equation. But, NO! They are everywhere but not where they should be. They are sitting in home playing, they are working in that brick factory where they legally shouldn\u2019t be, and they are lying on that corner of the street burning grass. But then, how could they go to school? The teachers are not motivated to teach the students; In most cases, they are there because that is the last job they could find, one that pays the least and our society has accepted it that way. Why? Simply because they are not a part of the vicious romantic consumerism cycle. If only they could produce something that could be exchanged with money. All they are doing is building the future, adding some fine touches to it, how can that be important? No gains at all!\n\nThe situation is saddening, and its getting worse day by day. Every day a political party is angry, the schools are closed! a wife and a husband have a fight, the schools are closed. I am sure this situation frustrates many more and I am aware that there are wiser beings that are working on fixing this, trying to be a part of the solution. Not rant like me by making a fuss of the problem. I think there is only one right way to solve this problem and its not a quick one, its one that takes its time but does the job. We have to change our culture, our society, our views. Education has to be taken seriously. We have to build better schools, develop infrastructure. Not schools that are money making machines, but schools that are shaping better humans and better futures. Invest the money a school generates into the teachers, into other schools. Build standards, standards that schools have to be built up to. The government has to play an active role in this, the political parties have to play an active role in this, we the citizens have a bigger role to play in this. Government schools have to rise, rise to standards that set benchmarks. The system has to invest into the future, the future that will build the system in return."}

It was a great hike with a nice weather accompanied with some beautiful landscapes. Perfect recipe for a good hike.\n\nLike every other hikes, this one also helped me think deeply and contemplate about a number of things. Among them, most of my energy was spent on thinking about the hike itself.\n\nMost of it was directed towards how can we use Hike for Nepal to create some positive impact, possibly in the hiking location, during the hike. How can we bring some positive change, slowly and steadily.\n\nOne of the things that I noticed, the hike was full of well educated Nepalese who were decently well off (approximately 1 out of 5 had a DSLR, everyone had a pretty good camera phone). This was a great group of people, possibly a specific group that could do a lot for the community. Another topic that bugged me considerably during the hike was all the plastic packaging that was littered over the place. It was sad, how ignorant we have been towards our environment. From Wai-Wai packets to empty bottles everywhere. The first thing that we could definitely do to fight this is by cleaning the mountains and hills during our hikes. I did my part during the hike and we did something similar in one of our hikes in the Bavarian Alps.\n\nThe question that I would like to ask is, how can we scale this idea of cleaning the mountains during our hike? How do we scale it from one person to the whole group. The biggest benefit of this would be that hikers would learn to clean the mountains and take back their own garbage with them. Thus, ensuring the mountains to be clean, the nature to be serene and experiences to be breathtaking.\n\nFinally, I would like to remind one of the rules from the Golden Rules for Living\n\nIf you open it, close it.\nIf you turn it on, turn it off.\nIf you unlock it, lock it up.\nIf you break it, admit it.\nIf you can\u2019t fix it, call in someone who can.\nIf you borrow it, return it.\nIf you value it, take care of it.\n\nIf you move it, put it back.\nIf it belongs to someone else and you want to use it, get permission.\nIf you don\u2019t know how to operate it, leave it alone.\nIf it\u2019s none of your business, don\u2019t ask questions.\nIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it.\nIf it will brighten someone\u2019s day, say it.\nIf it will tarnish someone\u2019s reputation, keep it to yourself.\n\u2014 Found somewhere in the vast vast internet, Source unknown"}

The reason is that I couldn\u2019t attend either of the two events. People were notified a couple of days in advance about the event. I\u2019m really sorry to put this out, even though it should have been obvious, two days prior notice for a meeting/event  is too less of a time. Inviting the community atleast one week in advance should be part of the event etiquette recipe. We are failing at this.

Finally, the venue opens up, we fill our bottles, get an initial briefing about the hike, get into our Sajha bus and off we go.\n\nWe reach Lakhuri Bhanjyang and Kailash from artudio gives an amazing introduction to art. He explains how you can do art with anything and it likes in the eyes of the maker. We then divide into groups based on our tshirt color -\n\n. The whole hike we used materials from nature to build small art pieces. It was the best exercise to get to know other people from our groups.\n\nThe main motive of the hike was for the attendees, speakers and organizers to mingle more and get to network at a more deeper level. I think that\u2019s what exactly happened as I got to talk to so many people and know what they were doing, get an understanding of their point of view and have deeper conversations about tech, life, community and nature.\n\nApart from the main conference and hike, some of the speakers and attendees took the opportunity to do other activities.

{"url": "https://avinash.com.np/2015/11/22/on-forgiveness/", "origin": "https://avinash.com.np/", "title": "On Forgiveness", "content": "What do you think is the right course of action, bringing justice by punishment or forgiving the wrongdoer? Fighting the fight for ego or forgiving? These are tough discussions to have and there is enough philosophical evidence to justify either side of the argument. I have come to believe that there is no \u201cright-way\u201d or \u201cthe recipe\u201d that one can follow, one must always think about the implications, the stakeholders involved and the bigger picture and take the righteous action. Even though there is no golden rule there are set of doctrines and frameworks one can follow that is considered to be on a higher moral ground.\n\nMost of the times when we are thinking of forgiveness, the alternate course of action is radical, extreme, one that we consider not ourselves. The reason to be in such a state is generally because our pride has been touched, the ego has been hurt and betrayal has been committed.\n\n.. the same dualism underlies the nature and condition of man. Every excess causes a defect; every defect an excess. Every sweet hath its sour; every evil its good. Every faculty which is a receiver of pleasure has an equal penalty put on its abuse. It is to answer for its moderation with its life. For every grain of wit there is a grain of folly\u2026\n\nEmerson has very nicely said that the world is an equation and everything that is done will have a reaction. If that\u2019s the case then does it not make sense to follow the path of peace and let nature do its job. Why should we take part in the wrongdoing? Because we want to satisfy our ego, want our pride back. What guarantee is there that the pride is restored after the action? None. Maybe it is better to live without pride, without happiness. Being neutral in every sense. Every happiness will have its sadness.\n\nNo man had ever a point of pride that was not injurious to him.\n\nSimilar was the situation of Yudhishthir in Mahabharat when he was persuaded by his wife and brothers to go to war and fight against Duryodhan. This was during their time in exile. His response was that its harder to give forgiveness, it takes more energy to forgive.\n\nForgiveness is the strength of the virtuous. To fight is easy, but to forgive is difficult. To be patient is not to be weak; to seek peace is always the wiser course.\n\nThe epic has it that they went to war, the great battle of kurukshetra took place and after numerous tricks and deceits of Krishna (the charioteer and God) they win the war, they get their kingdom back. At this point of time Yudhishthir doesn\u2019t have pride in winning the war, is not content to have his kingdom back. On the contrary, he is sad, in remorse, in pain, thinking about all the deaths of his teacher, his brothers, his men.\n\nTo get a piece of the earth we totally abandoned men who were equal to the earth, men whom we should never have killed. And now we live with our kinsmen dead and our wealth exhausted\u2026 like dogs we greedily went after a piece of meat! Now our piece of meat is gone, and so are those who would have eaten it. The heroes are dead. The evil is done. Our kindgom has been laid waste. Having killed them, our rage is gone. Now this grief holds me in check!\nExcerpts from Mahabharat -\n\n(The difficulty of being Good)\n\nOne might argue if the path of forgiveness is always the higher moral ground, wouldn\u2019t the world be unfair. What would have happened to slavery in America? what would happen to Indians under the British Raaj ? What would have happened to Jews during WWII ? These are all valid questions and it does seem like forgiveness has a conflict with Justice in a larger sense.\n\nOne way to look at it is by weighing the deeds. Some deeds have so much evil, there is so much bad into it that it is beyond forgiveness or the psychological burden of forgiveness is too high to be granted. This does mean that its not our strength at display but our weakness at display in this case. In Mahabharat, Yudhishthir before going to war, justifies it as his duty and an act he must do even though he doesn\u2019t like it. Maybe the idea is to look at the bigger good and act accordingly. These are nevertheless really tough decisions to make and maybe your duty is what can justify the course of action. Maybe that is how Jack Dorsey would also justify\n\n.\n\nThese are very tough topics to think about and to come to a worthy conclusion. All I can say and suggest is to think of the possibilities, weight all the options, see the impact and then eventually\n\n. One fun learning I\u2019ve had is that, it is much easier to write on this topic than to have a contextual discussion."}

I got a letter which asked to be present at the customs office in 3 days.\n\nI went to the customs office. Had a talk with a super helpful lady, who helped me get my shipment. She then asked me to open the package, did an inspection of what was shipped. Finally, she told me the import duty  which I had to pay for the shipment. In less than 15 minutes I was out of the office and my job was done.\n\nOne month ago someone again shipped me a piece of gadget. This time it was sent to Kathmandu, Nepal. FedEx told me that my shipment was at the airport customs and I had to get hold of an agent at the customs to get my shipment. They delivered me the documents which I could use to extract the shipment.\n\nAll good and fine. I talked to an agent and handed him my documents, which were to be used to extract the shipment from the customs. I hoped it to be a quick and painless process. Unfortunately, the introduction of an agent to the process keeps us in the dark; Now, I have no idea what\u2019s going on in customs land.\n\nEach of my discussion with the customs agent was basically that the shipment couldn\u2019t be extracted and they\u2019ll try again tomorrow. After ~20 days I pushed the agent a little and tried to get more details. According to them, someone had shipped gold via FedEx which is why customs were not letting any FedEx document be extracted.\n\nI went to the customs office, and It was chaotic. It took me hours to find the right person to talk to. Basically, just to hear the same gold story again.\n\nIn the mean time, I mentioned this to FedEx as well, the only support they could give me was \u201cI\u2019ll talk to my superior and see how we can help you here\u201d\n\nFast forward today, I still don\u2019t have my shipment. Nepal Government still doesn\u2019t have the customs duty they deserve. Lose-Lose situation. Unless, my shipment has been hijacked and a customs official has gifted it to his son. Then, someone does win here. Believe me, I have heard stories of that happening.\n\nThis process is seriously messed up and is the story of pretty much every government office in Nepal. The processes in offices are so chaotic, super ad-hoc and enough touch points to exploit a person. Which is also the reason why going to a government office is a dreadful experience every time.\n\nOur systems are messed up, our processes are messed up and the sad part is that there is no one doing anything about it. The only place one can complain or state grievances is to a twitter handle (or bot) of HelloSarkar. It definitely gives one a feeling of being heard, but nothing happens in the end.\n\nThis one time, all I have is a rant. No solutions, No actions that can be taken to make things better. If there is something that we can do, please enlighten me. I\u2019m all ears.\n\nUpdate : I did get my shipment eventually"}

The world got divided, the poor countries make and the rich countries consume. There is an incentive to have cheap labor in the world.

Shouldn\u2019t it be the other way round, that all products are \u201cfair-trade\u201d by default and the products that have had unfair procedures would be labeled as \u201cunfair-trade\u201d.

Contrary to the fact that a lot would suggest to do it at a startup, I wanted to do it at a big company because I have never worked at one and wanted to learn from that experience. It must be magic to manage so many people, so many developers and still spit out the best of the products.\n\nI applied to number of companies but I would like to comment on my experience with facebook, microsoft and mozilla. Facebook was kind of sad because I had an interview where I was asked some basic questions about JavaScript and we talked about how some things were implemented in facebook. Post the interview, they didnt reply for about a month and when I contacted the recruiter, got a reply that I couldn\u2019t be offered a postition. Sad :\u2018(\n\nNext was Microsoft. This one was really surprising because the interviewer asked me some really random question and two puzzles and eventually replied with a negative. Maybe I was supposed to not solve the puzzles.\n\nWhen all this action was happening, I had also applied for an internship at mozilla. This was one that I had some expectations from, mostly because I had been a contributor to mozilla for some time and luckily there was an open internship position for a project that I had already been contributing to. I applied and Kaboom, \u201cwe did not find a fit this time\u201d. This was very disheartening, but I eventually talked to one of the project devs about it and he told that he\u2019d look into it. About a week later, I got an email from a recruiter saying they\u2019d like to interview me for the internship. Yay!\n\nWell, that did sound awesome, I hopped into the opportunity and did some reading, sharpening that blade. I had 3 really interesting interviews and after quite a long wait I got an email which basically said that they\u2019d like to move with another candidate mostly because he had more experience and I still had a year of university to learn from(o_O).\n\nSo, basically after this I was quite sad and felt really bad. I for one thought a lot about this and there were the times when I thought maybe I was not good at all. This brought me to think about some of my open source contributions as well. I used to contribute to open source mostly because I was learning a lot and learned a lot about good code, code review, processes and approach to some serious problems. But, with of all of this it also felt like why was I even contributing to a project where I was not even worth it. Sadly, I do feel that at times, but I like it when I learn.\n\nI know recruiting is a tough work and there are some tough and quick decisions to make because of which a lot of factors come into play like where one comes from, where one is currently located, one\u2019s name and lots of other tiny details. I dont say its intentional but everyone is judgemental when you have to make a decision. That is why I know lots of amazing people back in India and Nepal who have been rejected who I think are among the A grade talent and lots of people would agree to me. Maybe there\u2019s a problem, one that seriously needs to be solved. But yes, this doesn\u2019t change the fact that I may be useless as well (lets hope I\u2019m not).\n\nWell, I have been conspirating on some secret schemes with a bunch of amazing people and I must say, I am enjoying it. Regarding contributing to mozilla, I would be (as a developer)inactive for a while, for sure, maybe a lot more. But I am still the guy who contributes to the open web and loves to see the web crossing it boundaries."}

This line has been so smartly crafted, I feel awe everytime I read it.\n\nGandalf! If you had heard only a quarter of what I have heard about him, and I have only heard very little of all there is to hear, you would be prepared for any sort I of remarkable tale.\n\nIn the first\n\n, there is a scene where Gandalf explains why there is a Hobbit with the Dwarves. This line has a lot of signifiance in terms of understanding what\u2019s important in life, the power of mundane daily tasks.\n\nMithrandir, why the Halfling?\n\nI do not know. Saruman believes that it is only great power that can hold evil in check. But that it is not what I\u2019ve found. I\u2019ve found it is the small things, every act of normal folk that keeps the darkness of at bay \u2014 simple acts of kindness and love. Why Bilbo Baggins? Perhaps it is because I am afraid, and he gives me courage.\n\nAnd, before I close this, another well crafted line from JRR Tolkien; this one is not from the hobbit, but from \u201cThe fellowship of the ring\u201d. I\u2019ve read it number of times and every time its confusing, but does tickle the brain.\n\nI don\u2019t know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve.\n\nFin."}

My method of reading the book has been rather unmethodical. Every couple of days/weeks when I feel like it, I pick up the book and continue reading where i last left off. Sometimes when I come across a strong thought (which happens more often than not in this book), I keep that thought in my mind and try to put it into action over time.\n\nThe following excerpt from the book has had a huge impact on me. I think about it very often and it reminds me of other quotes and sayings that I keep close to myself (and have collected mentally over the years)\n\nLiving life as an artist is a practice.\nYou are either engaging in the practice or you\u2019re not.\n\nIt makes no sense to say you\u2019re not good at it\nIt\u2019s like saying, \u201cI\u2019m not good at beting a monk.\u201d\nYou are either living as a monk or you\u2019re not.\n\nWe tend to think of the artist\u2019s work as the output.\n\nThe real work of the artist is a way of being in the world.\n\nThere is another quote from the Psychologist Alfred Adler that I heard back in 2015 and It has impacted the way I act on this very much. The quote goes as follows\n\n\u201cIt is easier to fight for ones principles than to live up to them.\u201d.\n\nSuch a strong statement. We all have principles, and there are principles that we very often are very strict about in \u201cwords\u201d and stricter when we see other people going against it. But, when it comes to us living by those principles, we very easily defy them and create loopholes for our own convenience. The way this has impacted my is as follows \u2013 In most cases before acting and saying things to people, I think if they are pragmatic or rather principle based. If they are principle based, I tend to not speak them as often as I would in past. These are my principles and as long as someone else is not crossing boundaries, I would allow them to live by theirs and I\u2019d \u201ctry\u201d to live by mine. I don\u2019t want to spend my time \u201cfighting\u201d for my principles. Atleast, I am not here to spread it, I think.\n\nThere is one more quote along similar lines as Rick Rubin. It\u2019s from \u201cThe Tibetian book of living and dying\u201d by Sogyal Rinpoche. I unfortunately don\u2019t recall the exact words from the book, and don\u2019t have a copy to get it from. But, the feeling of the words remain with me \u2013\n\nYou cannot meditate for some time and then be not meditating. That is not how meditation works. Meditation is a way of life.\n\nSpeaking for myself, I tend to think a lot about my principles and topics that I am interested in. And based on that, I try to live my life focusing on those topics, learning about them, acting as I belong to learn about those topics and create something with them. Its not important if the creation changes the world. Its not important if the creation is well known in the world. The only thing that is important is that it changes me. And, it changes me for good. I hope."}

I would like it if everyone reads it again and make it their motto for 2018.\n\n\u2013\n\nIf you have been drowned in the overwhelming series of posts about new year\u2019s resolution and have come to a point that you have to make one,\n\nThe best new years resolution that you can make is to become a maker. We are surrounded by news, articles, blogs, videos, books and the source of information and knowledge is never-ending. But, in between all of this, what we have really forgotten is to think, think about stuff and develop a perception about things. This new year, make a resolution that you will be a thinker, a tinkerer.\n\nwill not be a mere consumer of knowledge, but, you\u2019ll make a contribution to the pool of knowledge. It is much better to read one article and think about it; Instead of reading numerous articles and just filling your database of knowledge.\n\nThe maker mentioned here is not the type of maker that hipsters are talking about now-a-days\n\n(* were talking of back then *)\n\n\u2013\n\nOn one hand, I will (have started already) invest more time in documenting things I learn (for myself and others). On the other hand, I have to start policing myself on reading every other article/book/comment. Let\u2019s see how that will go, only time will tell.\n\nRemember, It is important to\n\nwhat you want to do, the first step to make things real.\n\nIn some cases, same same, but different :D\n\nA post shared by\n\n(@pumbaaguy) on\n\n\u2013\n\n** Do it!! even if it sucks.

This was a two day event completely focused on developing web applications which would also work on Firefox OS.\n\n###Day 1\nThe first day of the event was aimed at giving the audience an idea of mozilla, the mozilla community and Firefox OS, ofcourse. Vineel started by talking about mozilla and the community, Sayak continued by introducing the idea of Firefox OS and why it was required, Soumya then took on the stage and discussed some technical details about the platform and eventually Robin, Sayak, Biraj and me gave some demos on firefox OS application and the process of writing a basic \u201chello world\u201d application. The talks went pretty well but one thing that struck me was the audience. This was a very different audience, compared to other events because they were paying attention, asking questions, interacting and were actually making sense. Believe me, this rarely happens in an engineering college in India :D.\n\n###Day 2\nThe second day was roughly divided into two parts, the hackaton and the presentations. The hackathon went pretty well and most of the attendees got a taste of, how easy it was to make an application for firefox OS using open web technologies. It was amazing to see about 30 applications being presented at the end of the day. I guess, we can say it was a win!\n\nThat was all about the event. I would like to thank the FORMAT Team, especially Avik, Gaurab and Subhashish for the warm reception and managing the event in such a professional manner.

In some cases I have also added the reasoning or the idea that is being sent across by the text or just notest that made sense to accompany them. I am still reading the whole essay and will at one point write my thoughts and views on it (maybe).\n\nThe essay mostly talks about why its important to know thyself; why knowing yourself and accepting your thoughts might be tough. The following part of the text talks about the times when one was not courageous enough to speak their heart or do what they heeded to do, and later realized that someone else said/did it and got all the glory (though some parts of the text also deals with why getting the glory, or working to get the glory is not important at all)\n\nA man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within, more than the lustre of the firmament of bards and sages. Yet he dismisses without notice his thought, because it is his. In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts: they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.\n\n.. Else, to-morrow a stranger will say with masterly good sense precisely what we have thought and felt all the time, and we shall be forced to take with shame our own opinion from another.\n\nThis part of the essay deals with one having to do something that they don\u2019t like, but are doing it just because it made sense at one point of time and they don\u2019t want to contradict themselves. It somehow goes into the lines of\n\nwhere one has the mental stress or discomfort because of contradictory beliefs in their mind and are motivated to reduce this dissonance (Based on the definition from wikipedia)\n\nThe other terror that scares us from self-trust is our consistency; a reverence for our past act or word, because the eyes of others have no other data for computing our orbit than our past acts, and we are loath to disappoint them.\n\nBut why should you keep your head over your shoulder? Why drag about this corpse of your memory, lest you contradict somewhat you have stated in this or that public place? Suppose you should contradict yourself; what then? It seems to be a rule of wisdom never to rely on your memory alone, scarcely even in acts of pure memory, but to bring the past for judgment into the thousand-eyed present, and live ever in a new day. In your metaphysics you have denied personality to the Deity: yet when the devout motions of the soul come, yield to them heart and life, though they should clothe God with shape and color. Leave your theory, as Joseph his coat in the hand of the harlot, and flee.\n\nWith consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words, and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said to-day. \u2014 \u2018Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood.\u2019 \u2014 Is it so bad, then, to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh.\n\nThe following paragraph tries to talk about the moment, and how one should live in the present and not sulk in the past or worry about the future. It is somehow way more philosophical compared to the rest of the text till this part. Similar ideas have been mentioned in Buddhist texts that talk about mindfulness and being available for the moment rathar than being in a different point of time.\n\nMan is timid and apologetic; he is no longer upright; he dares not say \u2018I think,\u2019 \u2018I am,\u2019 but quotes some saint or sage. He is ashamed before the blade of grass or the blowing rose. These roses under my window make no reference to former roses or to better ones; they are for what they are; they exist with God to-day. There is no time to them. There is simply the rose; it is perfect in every moment of its existence. Before a leaf-bud has burst, its whole life acts; in the full-blown flower there is no more; in the leafless root there is no less. Its nature is satisfied, and it satisfies nature, in all moments alike. But man postpones or remembers; he does not live in the present, but with reverted eye laments the past, or, heedless of the riches that surround him, stands on tiptoe to foresee the future. He cannot be happy and strong until he too lives with nature in the present, above time.\n\nOn failure, and pressures from the society and believing in yourself.\n\nIf our young men miscarry in their first enterprises, they lose all heart. If the young merchant fails, men say he is ruined. If the finest genius studies at one of our colleges, and is not installed in an office within one year afterwards in the cities or suburbs of Boston or New York, it seems to his friends and to himself that he is right in being disheartened, and in complaining the rest of his life. A sturdy lad from New Hampshire or Vermont, who in turn tries all the professions, who teams it, farms it, peddles, keeps a school, preaches, edits a newspaper, goes to Congress, buys a township, and so forth, in successive years, and always, like a cat, falls on his feet, is worth a hundred of these city dolls. He walks abreast with his days, and feels no shame in not \u2018studying a profession,\u2019 for he does not postpone his life, but lives already. He has not one chance, but a hundred chances. Let a Stoic open the resources of man, and tell men they are not leaning willows, but can and must detach themselves; that with the exercise of self-trust, new powers shall appear; that a man is the word made flesh, born to shed healing to the nations, that he should be ashamed of our compassion, and that the moment he acts from himself, tossing the laws, the books, idolatries, and customs out of the window, we pity him no more, but thank and revere him, and that teacher shall restore the life of man to splendor, and make his name dear to all history.\n\nTo the end of the essay, the author talks about the\n\n. To begin with, I had a totally different view on travelling, like the \u201chow it changes you\u201d and \u201cyou discover yourself\u201d view that the world has, but since the last\n\n\u2044\n\nmonths, I have come to realise that travelling is just a concept that has come from romantic consumerism. Author\n\nbriefly talks about it in his book\n\nas well. Nevertheless, this is a different view on the same thing and was quite interesting to read, since it is dated from the 19th century.\n\nTravelling is a fool\u2019s paradise. Our first journeys discover to us the indifference of places. At home I dream that at Naples, at Rome, I can be intoxicated with beauty, and lose my sadness. I pack my trunk, embrace my friends, embark on the sea, and at last wake up in Naples, and there beside me is the stern fact, the sad self, unrelenting, identical, that I fled from. I seek the Vatican, and the palaces. I affect to be intoxicated with sights and suggestions, but I am not intoxicated. My giant goes with me wherever I go.\n\nTo wrap things up,\nA quote from the book Khushi by Vijay Kumar (\u0916\u0941\u0938\u0940 - \u0935\u093f\u091c\u092f \u0915\u0941\u092e\u093e\u0930 ) is very apt to this topic:\n\n\u0905\u093e\u092b\u0942\u0932\u093e\u0908 \u0905\u093e\u092b\u0948\u0901 \u092a\u0930\u093f\u092d\u093e\u0937\u093f\u0924 \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0928\u0901 \u092d\u0928\u0947 \u0905\u0930\u0941\u0932\u0947 \u092e\u0932\u093e\u0908 \u0924\u093f\u0928\u0915\u0948 \u0938\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0926\u0905\u0928\u0941\u0938\u093e\u0930 \u092a\u0930\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0930 \u092c\u0928\u093e\u090f\u0930 \u0916\u093e\u0928\u0947\u091b\u0928\u094d \u0964\n\u2013 \u0932\u094b\u0930\u094d\u0921\u0947\n> If I don\u2019t define myself others will make a dish of me based on their taste and eat.\n\nPS: still reading and will be adding stuff"}
{"url": "https://chsmc.org/2024/03/inaka-summer/", "origin": "https://chasem.co/thoughts/", "title": "Boku no Natsuyasumi | Chase McCoy", "content": "Several months ago, in\n\n, I\u00a0discovered\n\nby Tim Rogers (known as Action Button).\n\nTo call this a review is surely stretching the limits of the word\u2019s meaning as we know it.\n\nBoku no Natsuyasumi, henceforth shortened as Bokunatsu, is a game for the original PlayStation released 24 years ago in Japan. And only in Japan. It centers on a young boy, Boku, spending a month of his summer vacation with his aunt, uncle, and their family in the countryside of Japan in August of 1975.\n\nPlayers can explore the countryside as Boku, collect bugs, fish, fly kites, and other low-stakes activities you might expect from a child on summer break.\n\nSlowly, you learn about the people around you and their stories.\n\nSounds simple, but watch Tim\u2019s review and you\u2019ll see that the game is a subtle masterclass in storytelling, menu design, cinematography, typography, skeuomorphism, Japanese culture, sound design, memory, and even mortality.\n\nI became determined to experience the game myself, which is easier said than done given that it was never released outside of Japan. I managed to find\n\n, translated by a fan, for the game\u2019s sequel Boku no Natsuyasumi 2: Umi no Bouken-hen (My Summer Vacation 2: Sea Adventure Chapter). The sequel, released two years after the original, also follows a boy named Boku vacationing in the countryside in August of 1975.\n\nArmed with the patch file, I needed 3 more items to complete my quest: a PS2 emulator, a PS2 BIOS (the software pre-installed on the console\u2019s chipset), and a copy of Boku no Natsuyasumi 2.\n\nLuckily, the emulator is easy to come by. I downloaded\n\n, which is an open source PS2 emulator that works quite well on my MacBook Air.\n\nUnfortunately, for Legal Reasons\u2122 I cannot provide a link to the PS2 BIOS or the the game itself, but a cursory Google search should turn up the files you need without too much trouble.\n\nWith these 4 talismans in hand I was able to perform the necessary ritual of resurrection: apply the English patch to the game, boot up the PS2 emulator, load the game.\n\nAfter a few clicks\u2026 paydirt.\n\nAn experienced gamer might find this process mundane, but to me it feels like the internet equivalent of breaking open an ancient, hidden tomb. At this point I could only imagine what treasures may lie within.\n\nWhat I discovered is undoubtedly a work of art, made clear by my time playing this iteration and from Tim\u2019s review of the original. The games also happen to be an example of the billions of bytes of lost media that are just waiting to be rediscovered by someone who will appreciate them.\n\nHere is a game, published 22 years ago, that has managed to evoke feelings of nostalgia and wistfulness in me today, in 2024. This must be the closest thing to time travel I\u2019ll ever experience.\n\nI knew lots about the game before playing due to Tim\u2019s review (which, again, is a 6 hour masterpiece), but there are two aspects I couldn\u2019t fully appreciate until playing: the game\u2019s backgrounds and soundscapes.\n\nFirst, the backgrounds. Bokunatsu makes use of a fixed perspective, where the camera only changes angles when the character moves to another scene. Each area that the user can move through is set upon a\n\nhand-painted background. If you\u2019ve ever seen a Miyazaki film you have a sense for the feelings that these backdrops create. A 3D modeled scene would never have evoked such a strong sense of place, time, and character, and the creative decision to use hand drawn backgrounds makes all the difference.\n\nThere\u2019s a narrative purpose to the backgrounds as well, signaling the time of day as they change throughout between different paintings for day, afternoon, and night.\n\nThe backgrounds were done by artists at an animation studio called Kusanagi.\n\n, but I heartily encourage you to browse through all of the art on their site.\n\nKazuo Oga is a famous background painter and the person responsible for many of the backgrounds in your favorite Miyazaki films.\n\n:\n\nThat\u2019s really the heart of it. Oga notices things \u2014 little things. He gets a feel for them. When he sits down to work, he brings with him all the unimportant details that matter the most. Then, with his paint, he creates an artwork that centers those details, elevates them. It\u2019s more a way of seeing and feeling than it is a technique.\n\nAll the unimportant details that matter the most\u2014paying attention to these details are precisely what make Bokunatsu, from its backgrounds to the narrative itself, so plainly striking.\n\nThe backgrounds are complimented by the soundscapes. These are, in my opinion, the best part of the game.\n\nOf all the characteristics of summer, it may be the sounds which I most associate with the season. I grew up in the rural south, and Bokunatsu manages to capture the droning sounds of summer in a way I\u2019ve never experienced before in media.\n\nAt times, I\u2019ve let the game run in the background just to listen to the soundscapes.\n\n, Sony sent a team into the mountains to capture sounds for the game.\n\nDear reader, I\u2019m here to tell you that the effort paid off.\n\nThe game\u2019s environment is alive with the sounds of insects chirping, the wind blowing through a nearby chime, the trickling of a nearby stream. As Boku explores the countryside time advances and, like the background art, the sounds change to evoke the feeling of morning, afternoon, and night.\n\nAnimal Crossing, which debuted the year after the original Boku no Natsuyasumi game, is held up as the shining example of cozy, relaxing video games. I am a true fan of the Animal Crossing franchise, but with its gameplay literally focused on grinding in order to pay your landlord they stand in stark comparison to a game like Bokunatsu. Animal Crossing rewards completionism, and in doing so makes the game about grinding instead of actually relaxing.\n\nIn comparison, the only thing you\u2019ll get for collecting all of the bugs or catching all of the fish in Boku is a diary entry written by the boy at night before bed. And, like in real life, maybe that\u2019s enough?\n\nDiscovering and playing Bokunatsu (and watching Tim\u2019s 6 hour magnum opus of a review) has given me a deep appreciation for the timelessness of art and media.\n\nA game from 24 years ago, deeply steeped in a culture that isn\u2019t my own, has managed to create in me a sense of warm nostalgia. Its soundscapes remind me of home, but also make me long for a place I\u2019ve never been.\n\nIt\u2019s\u00a0also worth appreciating the meta aspect of the journey I went on to discover and experience this game, all because of a link in a newsletter. This is why the web is so special, and it\u2019s what an AI will never do: unearth a lost gem.\n\nWhen writing in his diary at the end of each in-game day, Boku reflects on \u201cthe most wonderful day in which nothing happened.\u201d Let this be a reminder that there is magic waiting to be found in the mundane."}
{"url": "http://colah.github.io/posts/2020-05-University/", "origin": "http://colah.github.io/", "title": "Do I Need to Go to University? -- colah's blog", "content": "Posted on May 30th, 2020\n\nI\u2019ve been somewhat successful as a researcher without an undergraduate degree or PhD.\n    As a result, I often have people ask me about whether it\u2019s possible to be successful without going to university,\n    whether they personally should, or whether I can help them persuade their parents.\n    At this point, I've probably received around a hundred emails on this topic.\n    It's still hard to know how to respond.\n\nI\u2019m reluctant to encourage people I don\u2019t know well to take non-traditional paths,\n    because I think they\u2019re riskier and depend a lot on the person.\n    In fact, I suspect that many of the people who write to me would be well served by going to university.\n    At the same time, I think alternative paths can be a great choice for some people\n    -- in some cases, significantly better than going to university.\n\nUnfortunately, society isn\u2019t very well set up to support and validate young people for whom this is the better choice.\n    So, if you\u2019re considering doing such a thing, you not only need to reason about whether it\u2019s a good decision, but may also need to navigate tricky emotional and social challenges.\n\nI suspect that some people who write to me are really looking for validation and support of their preference to not go to university.\n    Unfortunately, I\u2019m not well positioned to give that support, because I don\u2019t know them well.\n\nWhat I can give, and what this essay aims to do,\n    is to share thoughts on ways to think about the decision,\n    navigating the social and emotional challenges,\n    and resources you may find helpful.\n\nMy first suggestion is to compare university to concrete alternatives.\n    Instead of asking \u201cIs university good?\u201d, ask \u201cDo I have something more compelling to do?\u201d.\n    Instead of \u201cShould I do a PhD?\u201d, ask \u201cWhere can I find the best environment to grow as a researcher?\u201d.\n    And so forth.\n\nSpending a year doing something else is almost always reversible:\n    if you end up wanting to go back to university, it was just a gap year.\n    As a result, the most important question is whether it will be time well spent\n    and that requires you to think about what specifically you\u2019ll be doing.\n\nIf your plan is to learn or work on projects independently, it\u2019s worth thinking especially carefully.\n    This can be great -- I did it for three years and grew a lot as a result -- but it can also very easily fail.\n    Some important questions to ask yourself are:\n\nSome of these questions are tempting to just say yes to without engaging:\n    \u201c\n\nI can work self-directed without structure.\u201d\n    But these are actually difficult things, and switching to having no structure is jumping into the deep end.\n    Many of the people I\u2019ve seen successfully work independently in their late teens / early twenties had a history of independent study or projects before doing so.\n    For example, many Thiel Fellows had either self studied to the point where they were they largely knew the undergraduate curriculum in some topic, or had significant applied expertise in programming.\n\nDoing an internship, residency, or startup can be easier\n    -- at least in some regards -- than working independently.\n    There\u2019s more structure (especially in the first two) and a clearer path to supporting yourself.\n    For these, I would mostly focus on how valuable you think the experience will be.\n    Do you feel like you\u2019ll learn? Does it feel like a good community? Does it feel important?\n    If it feels urgent, is the urgency for good reasons?\n\nIt\u2019s important to be aware that not having a degree can have several negative long-term consequences.\n\nUniversity degrees have a lot of signaling and credentialing value.\n    They cheaply communicate to other individuals and organizations that you have some baseline skills, at least in theory.\n    In some fields, you can succeed without a degree by demonstrating skill in other ways (publications, open source projects, portfolios, talks, awards, work history, referrals, etc).\n    Other fields are less accepting.\n    How can you tell which type of field you're in?\n    One useful test can be to look for examples of people who are successful without degrees in your field.\n    Even if your field is very good about this, you may wish to move into another field at some later point and run into challenges where your previous successes aren\u2019t legible to the new field, or the new field is more credential focused.\n\nUnfortunately, traditional credentials may be more important for demographics than others.\n    As a white male, I suspect that it's easier for me to be taken seriously without a degree that it would be for others.\n    If you are part of a group that society is less likely to perceive as skilled by default, it may be harder to do without the validation of a degree.\n    This is obviously really unfair, but I don't feel qualified to give advice on it or comment on how big an issue it is.\n\nThere's also a weird flip side to all these downsides.\n    Once you establish yourself as competent there is this kind of threshold effect where not having a university degree can suddenly start causing people to actually take you more seriously.\n    This kind of countersignalling effect seems to be common when you do non-traditional things.\n\nIn addition to the direct career consequences, not having a degree can be a source of major immigration challenges.\n    The version of this I\u2019ve seen most often is people wanting to move to the US (usually the Bay Area) but being ineligible for most visas due to the lack of a degree.\n    If you think you may have this problem, try to do a short consultation with an immigration lawyer early: there may be things you can do to start building a case.\n    (For those immigrating to the US, the solution to this is usually to get an \u201calien of extraordinary ability\u201d O-1 visa, which doesn\u2019t require a degree but does require a lot of evidence of your accomplishments.)\n\nUnfortunately, even if you feel confident that you would be best served by taking a non-traditional path, many young people face significant social and emotional barriers to doing so, particularly from adults.\n    While some people are lucky enough to have a family that will support them doing something unusual, many are not.\n    This can manifest in ways ranging from gentle skepticism, to lack of support, all the way up to coercive measures.\n    It can also involve hurtful accusations or gossiping (eg. someone isn\u2019t going to university because they\u2019re lazy or failed).\n\nSkepticism or lack of support from family often comes from a good place.\n    People around you are, naturally, worried about what will happen to you if you do something unusual.\n    They may also face other pressures.\n    For example, they may worry that their peers will think they are being irresponsible by \u201callowing\u201d their child to do this.\n    They may even worry how it will influence legal proceedings like a divorce, if such a thing is relevant.\n    It can feel especially hurtful when these other pressures are clearly major factors.\n    It\u2019s a difficult and emotionally stressful situation on both sides.\n\nThe situation is often complicated by deeply asymmetric power dynamics.\n    Depending on the situation, your parents may have direct legal power, you may depend on them for financial support, you may depend on them for housing, and even if you are self-sufficient they may have legal control of your assets.\n    They also have, independent of their hard power, a great deal of emotional power from the role and authority they\u2019ve exercised throughout your life.\n    This can make the situation scary, volatile, and in some cases potentially dangerous for you.\n\nThe most common resolution I\u2019ve seen or heard of is external validation:\n    someone gets a Thiel Fellowship, or their startup gets funded, etc, and people around them become much more supportive.\n    This can be a somewhat disappointing resolution for the \u201cvalidated\u201d party (\u201cwhy couldn\u2019t they believe in me before I was endorsed?\u201d).\n    It may help to try and picture things from the perspective of someone who is scared for you and doesn\u2019t understand the situation very well.\n\nIn many cases, communicating with your family may be helpful.\n    There\u2019s a lot of general advice on how to have difficult conversations (non-violent communication, difficult conversations, etc.) that might be useful in having an effective conversation.\n    There's also more specific advice on how to have particular kinds of difficult conversations with your parents (eg. telling them that you're gay, or an atheist, or other things they may not respond to well) that may have some transferable advice.\n    Unfortunately, there are also cases where communicating might make things worse, because of the asymmetric power adults may have over you.\n\nWhile it won\u2019t solve the fundamental issues, it can be extremely emotionally helpful to have an aligned support network.\n    Having people who were proud of me for good reasons and could recognize my successes and failures was deeply affirming and motivating for me.\n    This is something you can deliberately build by seeking out people who share your interests and values.\n\n(In truly extreme cases, such as abusive families,\n    there may be ways to get support from a family court, get yourself emancipated or have your custody transferred.\n    There may be softer courses of action, like living with family or friends for a bit without legal action.\n    These are extreme courses of action that may sometimes be the best of many terrible options in rare cases.\n    I've also heard stories where they made things worse.\n    I don't feel qualified to give advice on this; if you are considering it, please seek specialized advice and be careful.\n    You may be able to go to a legal clinic or get a pro-bono consultation with a family lawyer.\n    You may wish to confirm confidentiality rules before speaking, in case they are different for someone underage.\n    There may be specialized non-profits in your area that can give you advice, hotlines, or useful resources online.\n    I am not the right person to ask for advice on this.)\n\nFor many people, university is a period of social development.\n    They learn social skills, make long-term friends, and form romantic relationships.\n    For some people, especially readers of this essay, it seems possible this is the biggest benefit of university.\n\nIt seems like many precocious young adults who leave university have less friends their own age.\n    Does that mean that not going to university stunts social development?\n    It seems hard to tell to what extent going to university actually causally effects social outcomes rather than just being correlated with them.\n    After all, it seems like many of us also didn't connect that much with our peers in grade school.\n    For example, I was intensely bullied in elementary school, and while I had friends in high school, I wasn't that close to anyone.\n    In fact, until recently, the vast majority of my friends have been 5-10 years older than me.\n    Conversely, I have friends I'd put in the \"precocious teenager\" category who went to university but didn't seem to really make friends their own age, especially during their freshman year.\n\nMy guess is that correlated issues -- like not fitting in with one's age group and maybe being a bit shy -- are the bigger effect,\n    but that there's also a direct causal effect from not going to university.\n    Either way, I suspect some readers may find it hard to make friends among peers, regardless of their decision on university.\n    So it seems good to talk about a little bit.\n\nFirstly, I think it's okay to have your friends be older than you.\n    Teenage-Chris had lots of deeply meaningful connections with older friends and I think that was fine.\n    They were often more emotionally mature, thoughtful, and principled than my teenage peers, and sometimes felt like older siblings.\n    Over time, the age gap became less significant and by my mid 20s it was gone.\n\nI do think there's a lot to be said for investing in being social if it doesn't come naturally for you.\n    University might make being social easier, but I think committing yourself to investing it it is much more important.\n    For me, I've always disliked bars and parties, but I deeply cherish having close friends, which requires me to meet people.\n    What should I do?\n    Partly I've found it important to push to go to parties even if I find them stressful.\n    But I've found it more helpful to just really deliberately seek out social contexts that I do like,\n    and to create new ones if I can't find them.\n    For example, last year I held lots of small tea parties, and it was lovely!\n\nAnother concern is the effect of not going to university on romantic relationships.\n    Many people have their first serious relationship in university, and I've seen friends, both male and female, worry about having missed this.\n    For me, there was a point when it seemed like most of my peers had found a partner in undergrad,\n    and younger-Chris was dramatically worried that he'd lost his chance and would be alone forever.\n    In retrospect, I was more worried than I needed to be.\n    Most of those relationships didn't last and, at least in my social circles, most people find their long-term partner outside university.\n    I'm now inclined towards a middle view: going to university is helpful for finding your life partner, and missing out on that is perhaps the biggest cost of not going, but it's also only one factor.\n    It's cliche, but the thing that really does matter is putting yourself out there, meeting people you might connect with,\n    and waiting for the\n\nto add up.\n\nThere's one final subtle issue I want to mention, which intersects with all of the above:\n     not going to university can create a professional gap between you and your age group.\n    I became a full time researcher at Google Brain when I was 23.\n    In that role, I started teaching, mentoring, and even managing residents and PhD interns who were often quite a bit older than me.\n    And sometimes when I spent time with people in my age group outside of work -- often, junior PhD students at that point -- people would not infrequently ask me about opportunities to do an internship with me.\n    But the thing I wanted was to find friends and peers, not find an intern!\n    Even when people didn't do this, I worried a lot about the possibility that I was in a position of power relative to people I was interacting with.\n    Meanwhile, a lot of my professional colleagues were older than me and, having known me since I was a teenager, still treated me that way.\n    This dynamic of mismatched professional achievement faded for a variety of reasons as I moved into my mid and late 20s, but was still a strange aspect of that period of my life.\n\nMany of these opportunities don't have a formal application process.\n    You need to reach out to people.\n    This is a skill, but the basic recipe is to invest in figuring out who it makes sense to reach out to, understanding them, and writing a thoughtful\n    email.\n\nMy life would be in a very different position, were it not for that fact that many people intervened positively and greatly helped me.\n    Michael Nielsen, Yoshua Bengio, Jeff Dean, and Greg Corrado all took significant actions to support my career:\n    Michael mentored me when I was just beginning to do deep learning research and walked me through writing my first paper.\n    Yoshua invited and paid for me to visit MILA in 2013, and managed to get me admitted as a graduate student without an undergrad degree\n    (then I turned him down, which he was very kind about).\n    Jeff took me on as an intern. Greg continued managing me as an intern, and helped me convert to a full-time researcher at Google.\n    This chain of events was possible because the Thiel Fellowship initially gave me two years to work on whatever I wanted.\n\nEqually critical were the many people who supported me outside the context of deep learning research.\n  The hacklab.to community was an incredibly positive part of my life as a teenager, especially\n  Leigh Honeywell, Rob Gilson, Nicholas Dodds, Kate Murphy, Jade Bilkey, Eric Boyd, Madison Kelly, Alex Leitch, Paul Wouters, Sen Nordstrom and Alaina Hardie.\n  I'm also grateful to many professors at the University of Toronto for allowing me to audit courses as a high school student, and then giving me permission to take advanced courses in my one year there.\n  Related to this, I'm lucky that Brad Bass gave me a summer job doing programming at his lab in grade 10 and 11 -- I think I wasn't very useful, but spending months programming full time was great.\n  Too many other people supported me for me to really have any hope of mentioning everyone, but to list some of them:\n  Jen Dodd, Peter Salus,\n  Yomna Nasser,\n  Shai Maharaj,\n  Danielle Strachman,\n  Dario Amodei, Tamsyn Waterhouse, Daniela Amodei, Alex Dingle, Tim Telleen-Lawton, Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman,\n  and\n  Laura Ball.\n\nThanks as well to all those who commented on drafts of this essay including Zan Armstrong, Anja Boskovic, Erin McCloskey, Tom Reid, Deborah Raji, Ria Cheruvu, Emil Wallner, Ali Zaidi, and Danielle Strachman."}

I\n                            do. My close single friends \u2013 both male and female \u2013 generally do. The people I surveyed on\n                            Mechanical Turk do. (Many of the people I surveyed report they would take on\n\nto find a partner!)\n\nYou probably have several friends and acquaintances who are single and would be grateful for\n                            good suggestions on people to meet. (Caveat: thoughtfulness about this is important: there\n                            are\n                            cases where this kind of thing could be uncomfortable or hurtful.) I\u2019ve asked dozens of\n                            single\n                            friends if they\u2019d like me to try and matchmake them or if they\u2019d like an introduction to\n                            someone, and the answer has almost always been yes, and very appreciative.\n\nCan you actually generate good matches? I actually think the probability isn\u2019t that high, but\n                            it\u2019s still very worthwhile in expected value. In particular, I suspect the first few minutes\n                            you\n                            spend thinking about matchmaking is probably really high leverage, with steep diminishing\n                            returns. This is because you have fresh potential matches to consider, while your single\n                            friends\n                            have probably considered everyone who seems like a plausible match that they know.\n\nIn fact, it\n                            wouldn't surprise me at all if in the first hour one spends trying to matchmake, they can\n                            generate something like 10x more\n\nfor\n                            their single friends than those single friends could generate for themselves in an hour.\n\nYour friends probably spend a lot of time and energy seeking a partner, at that much lower\n                            micromarriages per hour return.\n                            I find it pretty exciting to be able to help at such a high multiplier!\n                            (I try to set aside 30-60 min twice a year to systematically think about potential matches.)\n                            Conversely, it's meant the world to me when friends -- and even kind internet strangers --\n                            have tried to set me up.\n\nI suspect that playing matchmaker right now is likely to be unusually impactful. Many of the\n                            mechanisms people rely on to meet potential partners have been disrupted by\n                            COVID.\n                            In a typical year, people have around a 5%/year chance of meeting the person they marry. I\u2019d\n                            guess\n                            it\u2019s been much lower the last two years.\n\nIt won\u2019t\n                            surprise me if the majority of the good I accomplish personally through matchmaking is\n                            accomplished during COVID.\n\nI\u2019ve been deliberately trying to matchmake for around five years. Although I\u2019ve had a few\n                            minor\n                            successes where I introduced people, the only cases where I\u2019ve seen it lead to a\n                            relationship\n                            have been when I\u2019ve schemed together with a friend about setting people up.\n\nMy working model is that the \u201cfuel\u201d of matchmaking is potential matches who haven\u2019t yet\n                            considered whether they should date. The reason you can often be more impactful with a\n                            marginal\n                            hour than your friends can be for themselves is that you know different people. But your\n                            social\n                            network still overlaps a lot with the friend\u2019s you\u2019re trying to match. If you really want to\n                            maximize your probability of suggesting new, potentially really good fits, you want to team\n                            up\n                            with other people who have different social networks.\n\nIn July 2020, I ran a virtual \u201cmatchmaking party\u201d. It was pretty successful. A small group,\n                            in\n                            about two hours, generated a bunch of matches and two eventually led to dating, although I\n                            don\u2019t know\n                            what the long-term relationship outcomes were.\n\nI\u2019m going to run a similar event, you can apply to participate here. Due to COVID, the event\n                            will be virtual.\n\nPlease fill out\n\nto apply.\n\nNo, it's open to any geography. In the sign-up form, you list what geographic regions\n                                you'd\n                                be matching people in. If no one else signs up with overlapping regions, I'll try to let\n                                you\n                                know to save you time if you don't want to join.\n\nIt will be a video call with some mechanism for breaking off into smaller conversations\n                                (maybe Rally?), along with a shared google doc or spreadsheet for listing people you're\n                                trying to match.\n\nOf course! I\u2019d be delighted for you to do so. (I\n                                certainly\n                                can\u2019t host as many matchmaking parties as I think should occur!) After the party, I plan\n                                to\n                                post\n                                templates of all my organizational documents for anyone hosting their own event to use.\n\nI think events for single people are a pretty brutal format. I\u2019ve\n                                gone\n                                to a few in the past myself and found them enormously stressful. The emotional stakes\n                                are\n                                pretty\n                                high for people involved, and that makes them awkward and uncomfortable (especially for\n                                people\n                                who are shy or socially anxious). It also makes things inefficient, because it\u2019s hard\n                                for\n                                people\n                                to just be really honest and rapidly assess compatibility.\n\nIt depends on how big the\n                                group\n                                is.\n                                I\u2019m nervous the structure wouldn\u2019t work very well for a group larger than 20-30 people.\n                                But\n                                I\u2019ll\n                                send everyone who applies all my notes so they can organize their own party!\n\nWe think this will be more effective if people are focused\n                                on\n                                matchmaking others. We want the emotional stakes to be low, and one is generally pretty\n                                invested\n                                in finding a match for themselves. If you\u2019re looking for matches yourself, try to think\n                                about\n                                whether you have any friends you think would be a good matchmaker for you and others!\n                                (And\n                                also\n                                consider if you want to match others \u2013 if finding a match would mean a lot to you,\n                                helping\n                                someone find a match would probably mean an enormous amount to them!)\n\nAs long as you\u2019re focused\n                                on\n                                others, I\u2019d be delighted to have you apply! (I\u2019m single myself, and I really want to\n                                help\n                                other\n                                people who are single find great matches.)\n\nWe expect information shared between matchmakers to be\n                                treated similarly to information found on a dating website. It isn\u2019t strictly private,\n                                but\n                                we\n                                expect people to treat it with care, and to try to act in the best interests of anyone\n                                who\u2019s\n                                information they receive access to.\n\nWell, a lot of them are probably already doing that.\n                                But honestly, I\u2019m pretty negative on dating websites:\n                                they seem to structurally encourage a lot\n                                of unhealthy things, and I think the\n\nreturn is probably\n                                worse than lots of other things. My guess is that introductions from friends are\n                                literally\n                                an order of magnitude better.\n\nIt\u2019s always seemed to me\n                                like\n                                professional matchmakers paid for by individual clients have uncomfortable incentives\n                                (the\n                                same\n                                could be said of dating websites). I\u2019m pretty excited about the idea of professional\n                                matchmakers\n                                who are operating in a more \u201cnon-profit\u201d style where they're funded by donations\n                                intended to\n                                support them generally rather than find matches for a specific person. (In fact, last\n                                year I\n                                made a $10K donation to someone experimenting with this!) But I think it\u2019s unlikely this\n                                is\n                                going to occur in a widespread enough way to help most of my or your friends in the near\n                                future.\n\nSorry, I only expect to be able to make helpful matches\n                                for\n                                people I know fairly well. (If I do know you but don\u2019t know that you\u2019re looking for a\n                                partner,\n                                please let me know!) Consider who the best person in your social circle to act as a\n                                matchmaker\n                                would be and send them this event!"}

When I was\n                            18, I dropped out of university to support a friend accused of terrorism, because I believe\n                            it\u2019s most important to support people when others don\u2019t. When he was found innocent, I\n                            noticed that deep learning was going to affect society, and dedicated myself to figuring out\n                            how humans could understand neural networks. I\u2019ve spent the last decade working on that\n                            because I think it could be one of the keys to making AI safe.\n\nServing others and working on important problems is a privilege, but it isn't the only thing\n                            I want in life.\n                            More than almost anything, I want to have a family: to have a partner and children to share\n                            life with.\n                            I\u2019ve been lucky to date several wonderful women, but it\u2019s always turned out we weren\u2019t quite\n                            looking for the same things. And so I wanted to try an experiment: simply trying to describe\n                            myself and the life I hope to build with a partner as earnestly, openly, and honestly as I\n                            possibly can, so that someone can reach out if what I\u2019ve written resonates.\n\nI\u2019d be delighted if we\n                            could increase the chances for each other, even just a little bit. If you think we might be\n                            a fit, I\u2019d love to do a video call or go on a walk and just chat about interesting things.\n\nYou can DM me\n\n(DMs open!) or send me an\n                            email at\n\n.\n                            Feel free to just tell me about some part of this document that resonated with you. :)\n\nYou\u2019re also very welcome to try and play matchmaker if you know someone else you think I\u2019d be\n                            compatible with.\n\nAwkward selfie at my favorite park. But gosh,\n                                isn\u2019t San Francisco beautiful?\n\nThere are some topics which are close to my heart. Dreams and ideas which spark my excited\n                            enthusiasm. Facts about the world which trigger an earnest drive to help. These topics feel\n                            close to who I am, woven into my soul. When I\u2019m around others who share similar feelings,\n                            part of me opens up. I am more myself, and can form deeper connections.\n\nA formative experience for me has been moral loneliness. As a young child, I was upset about\n                            how animals are treated but didn\u2019t know anyone with similar beliefs. As a teenager, I\n                            struggled with the Bible and became an atheist. But becoming an atheist left me alone in\n                            caring intensely about global poverty (this is something I still admire about the church I\n                            grew up in). As an adult, I\u2019m lucky to have found friends and community with similar values\n                            but\u2026 I\u2019d really love to find moral connection in a relationship.\n\nWhat do I mean by \u201cmoral connection\u201d? I don\u2019t mean believing all the same things: the last\n                            thing I\u2019d want would be for either of us to feel constrained in our independent moral\n                            judgment! But I think it would be lovely to have enough shared fundamental values to not\n                            feel alone, and to really see and value in each other our efforts to be good people. (I\n                            suspect an important part of balancing moral independence and connection is\n\n.)\n\nWhat are my values? I try \u2013 although I obviously don't always live up to this \u2013 to be\n                            genuinely truth-seeking, care about the welfare of all humans and animals, and be willing to\n                            act to improve them. I viscerally care about animal welfare and global poverty. I work on AI\n                            safety because I think there's a serious risk of it being unsafe. (Many values I hold are\n                            associated with Effective Altruism. However, there are also some things I'd disagree with\n                            the EA mainstream on, and I generally value moral independence.)\n\nI\u2019m not sure how exactly to articulate this, but I feel like the default trajectory of my\n                            life is to optimize it for efficiency and impact. Those are meaningful things to me \u2013\n                            especially as they relate to helping the world \u2013 but I don\u2019t want that to be the entirety of\n                            my life. I also don\u2019t want to get pulled into consumerism, or hedonism, or lots of other\n                            lifestyle attractors around me. Instead, I\u2019m \u2013 confusedly, graspingly, stumbling \u2013 trying to\n                            find something related to family, and connection, and reflection, and integrity.\n                            Wholesomeness.\n\nSomehow this idea of seeking \u201cwholesomeness\u201d feels very intertwined with relationships. I\n                            guess because \u201cfamily\u201d feels like a central part of it? Or because many of these things feel\n                            most meaningful when you\u2019re sharing them with someone?\n\nI\u2019m not really sure what it would look like for us to try and find wholesomeness in this\n                            sense. It\u2019s something we\u2019d need to find out together! Maybe we should live in a village with\n                            friends. Maybe we should build a home and live in the woods. Maybe we should drink tea every\n                            morning together as the sun rises. Maybe it\u2019s smaller subtle things. But if the vague thing\n                            I\u2019m gesturing at resonates with you, I\u2019d at least be an enthusiastic partner as we stumble\n                            towards it together.\n\nAside: I really like\n\nas one\n                            possible vision of \u201cwholesomeness\u201d, in particular threads that just have pictures of his\n                            family and their home.\n\nI find math deeply beautiful, and I get a lot of meaning out of it. This is true of science\n                            broadly as well, although to a somewhat lesser extent. I get a lot of joy out of learning\n                            and exploring and being curious and discovering. I\u2019d love to share that with you. I\u2019d love\n                            to work through a textbook we both find interesting, or research some topic, or do a small\n                            project. I\u2019d love to whiteboard, and share what we\u2019re thinking about, and be curious about\n                            the world together.\n\n(It\u2019s worth saying that this isn\u2019t necessarily an easy thing to do. I think a lot of people\n                            who are very intellectual can feel intellectually insecure talking to their partner. What if\n                            they say something \u201cdumb\u201d and their partner rejects them intellectually? But I think if we\n                            want to, we can work together to have an environment that\u2019s safe and allows us to explore\n                            ideas together.)\n\n... I also just find it really attractive when someone is genuinely fascinated by math or\n                            science. I'm usually slow to develop crushes, but a striking exception was an occasion when\n                            someone at a party rambled to me about cool biology papers they'd read recently for half an\n                            hour. Instant crush.\n\nMore than almost anything, I\u2019m excited to have a family with a partner someday. I\u2019m excited\n                            to do it with a particular set of motivations: to have a family, not just because it\u2019s a\n                            thing people do by default, but because it\u2019s an adventure we\u2019re both deeply excited for and\n                            invested in. To be trying to learn, together, how to make it beautiful and meaningful and\n                            alive, even when there are tricky moments. (To be clear: I fully expect having children to\n                            have lots of unpleasant and exhausting parts!)\n\nI\u2019m excited to have children, but I\u2019m even more excited to have children with someone. When I\n                            imagine it, a big part of what I\u2019m looking forward to is sharing it as a powerful, deep\n                            connection to my partner. Just the thought that there\u2019s a small possibility that a\n                            relationship might someday lead to having children with someone gives me an almost\n                            intoxicating sense of connection.\n\nI love going on walks after it rains. These photos were all taken at a\n                                park near my house. I\u2019d love to show you if we end up dating!\n\nIt\u2019s often unclear why relationships don\u2019t work out, but here are a few things I think were\n                            factors, in case they can help us avoid similar incompatibilities:\n\nDating profiles can be highly polished pictures of someone. I\u2019ve tried very hard to be\n                            earnest, but even so it\u2019s a very limited view. Thankfully, I have years of a pretty\n                            extensive online presence that might offer a more holistic picture. One starting point might\n                            be the\n\nand\n\n, or this\n\n. For a more unfiltered view, you could look at my\n\n(I think replies are\n                            more unfiltered than normal tweets) and go back through history.\n\nA friend suggested I should include a list of books I\u2019ve read. This turned into a whole\n                            additional doc. :)"}

I\u2019ve returned from holiday travels and am settling back into work for 2025. Here are three, quick, bookish recommendations from links that have crossed my desk recently.\n\nFirst, a newsletter: Katie Clapham\u2019s\n\nis a new favorite of mine.\n\nKatie runs an independent bookshop in Lancashire, and every Friday when she opens the shop she also starts a new draft of the newsletter. Throughout the day she fills it up with commentary on running a bookshop in these modern times, quips from the shoppers, witty observations, a record of books sold and purchased, etc. At the end of the day, she closes the shop and sends the newsletter.\n\nOne of my favorite genres of art is \u201ctotally mundane but fascinating and engaging for reasons that are hard to explain,\u201d and Receipt from the Bookshop fits that bill perfectly.\n\nMore than just being fascinating, though, it\u2019s a good reminder for us all how creativity and fulfillment as a writer\n\ncome from mundanity. There is beauty in the mundane! We can find it if we look hard enough.\n\nWhatever this is: more of it please.\n\nBooks are powerful cultural artifacts, and so much of human history is wound around them. It should be no surprise then that notebooks carry a similar significance.\n\nWell that\u2019s just what Roland Allen\u2019s book,\n\n, is all about. I picked it up recently after seeing it recommended by a few folks in their 2024 reading recaps.\n\nThe cast of historical characters that pop up throughout the book is a lot of fun, and the author does a great job of showing just how critical notebooks were to the development of civilization and culture as we know it today.\n\nAnother truly great example of something unassuming (notebooks) being explored with a contagious enthusiasm. There is, repeatedly, poetry in the mundane.\n\nBy the way, I love reading books which tell history non-linearly through the lens of ultra-niche subtopics. Another great example that comes to mind is\n\nby James Crawford. Books and buildings both make great portals back in time.\n\nFinally, a celebration of the book collectors, dealers, sellers, and conservators who preserve the art of books and bring the most important ones along into the future.\n\nWhile reading The Notebook: A History, I stumbled upon a 2019 documentary that resonated on the same frequency.\n\n, which (from what I can tell) has recently been made\n\n, focuses primarily on rare book dealers in New York City and their bookshops, and it\u2019s a visual feast for book lovers. But more importantly it\u2019s an homage to those still dedicating their lives to preserving the written word and the book as a form.\n\nThere\u2019s a clear and present danger to the world of books that is felt palpably in the documentary, with many sellers and collectors worried about a diminishing market for book collectors. There are also those in the film who see a bright future. It\u2019s nice to hear both takes.\n\nAs for myself, I am a huge fan of collecting physical books, and maintain a\n\nwhich you can browse if you\u2019d like. Whether you collect books or not, I recommend giving The Booksellers a watch."}
{"url": "https://chsmc.org/2023/03/weblogs-as-a-form/", "origin": "https://chasem.co/thoughts/", "title": "How blogs shaped the web | Chase McCoy", "content": "I have a lot of nostalgia for the era of blogging that I grew up with during the first decade or so of the 2000s.\n\nOf course there was a ton of great content about technology and internet culture, but more importantly to me it was a time of great commentary and experimentation on the form of blogging and publishing.\n\nAs social media and smartphones were weaving their ways into our lives, there was a group of bloggers constructing their own worlds. Before Twitter apps and podcast clients became the UI playgrounds of most designers, it was personal sites and weblogs that were pioneering the medium.\n\nLooking back, this is probably where my meta-fascination with the web came from. For me the most interesting part has always been the part analyzing and discussing itself.\n\nRobin Sloan puts it well (as he is wont to do):\n\nBack in the 2000s, a lot of blogs were about blogs, about blogging. If that sounds exhaustingly meta, well, yes\u200a\u2014\u200abut it was also SUPER generative. When the thing can describe itself, when it becomes the natural place to discuss and debate itself, I\u00a0am telling you: some flywheel gets spinning, and powerful things start to\u00a0happen.\n\nDesign, programming, and writing started for me on the web. I can recall the progression from a plain text editor to the Tumblr theme editor to learning self-hosted WordPress.\n\nAll of that was driven by the desire to tinker and experiment with the web\u2019s form. How many ways could you design a simple weblog? What different formats were possible that no one had imagined before?\n\nEarlier this week I listened to\n\nand was delighted to hear them discuss this very topic. Jason is one of the original innovators of the blog form, and I\u2019ve been following his blog, kottke.org, since I was old enough to care about random shit on the internet.\n\n, and Jason has been publishing online for even longer than that. All along the way, he has experimented with the form of content on the web. He\u2019s not alone in that\u2014many bloggers like him have helped to mold the internet into what it is today. The ones that influenced me besides kottke.org are\n\n,\n\n, Jim Coudal and\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n, and more that I\u2019m certainly forgetting.\n\n, and my personal favorite design of the site over the years\n\nJason and John have an interesting conversation during the podcast (starting around 25 minutes in) about how the first few generations of bloggers on the web defined its shape. Moving from print to digital mediums afforded a labyrinth of new avenues to explore.\n\nIt\u2019s always important to remind ourselves that many of the things we take for granted today on the web and in digital design had to be invented by someone.\n\nEarly weblogs did not immediately arrive at the conclusion of chronological streams\u2014some broke content up into \u201cissues\u201d, some simply changed the content of their homepages entirely.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until later that the reverse-chronological, paginated-or-endless scrolling list of entries was introduced and eventually became the de-facto presentation of content on the web. That standard lives on today in the design of Twitter, Instagram, etc., and it\u2019s fascinating to see that tradition fading away as more sites embrace algorithmic feeds.\n\nBy the way, I\u2019d be remiss here if I didn\u2019t mention Amy Hoy\u2019s amazing piece\n\n. Comparing the title of her piece with the title of this one, it\u2019s clear that not everyone sees this shift in form as a positive one, but she does a great job in outlining the history and the role that blogs played in shaping the form of the web. Her particular focus on early content management systems like Movable Type is fascinating.\n\nAnother great example that Jason and John discuss on the podcast is the idea of titling blog posts.\n\nThey point out that many early sites didn\u2019t use titles for blog posts, a pattern which resembles the future form of Tweets, Facebook posts, text messages, and more. But the rise of RSS readers, many of which made the assumption that entries have titles and design their UIs around that, forced many bloggers to add titles to their posts to work well in the environment so popular with their readers.\n\nJason mentions that this was one of the driving factor for kottke.org to start adding titles to posts!\n\nThis is an incredible example of the medium shaping the message, where the UI design of RSS readers heavily influenced the form of content being published. When optimizing for the web, those early bloggers and the social networks of today both arrived at the same conclusion\u2014titles are unnecessary and add an undue burden to publishing content.\n\nThis difference is the very reason why sending an email feels heavier than sending a tweet. Bloggers not using titles on their blog posts figured out tweeting long before Twitter did.\n\nWhen referring to the early bloggers at suck.com, Jason said something that I think describes this entire revolution pretty well.\n\n[\u2026]there was in information to be gotten from not only what they linked to, but how they linked to it, which word they decided to make the hyperlink.\n\nIt\u2019s not often that you have an entirely new stylistic primitive added to your writing toolbox. For decades you could bold, italicize, underline, uppercase, footnote, etc. and all of a sudden something entirely new\u2014the hyperlink.\n\nWith linking out to other sites being such a core part of blogging, it\u2019s no surprise that the interaction design of linking was largely discussed and experimented with.\n\ndiscussing all the ways that various blogs of the time handled posts primary geared towards linking to and commenting on other sites.\n\nAnother similar example is URL slugs\u2014the short string of text at the end of a web address identifying a single post. For many of my favorite bloggers, the URL slug is a small but subtle way to convey a message that may\n\nthe same as the message of the post itself. One other stylistic primitive unique to the web.\n\nThe different ways in which bloggers designed their site or linked to words became a part of their unique style, and it gave their each of them an entirely new way to express themselves.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to communicate how grateful I feel for this era of experimentation on the web, and specifically for Jason Kottke\u2019s influence on me as a designer. The past 25 years have been a special time to experience the internet.\n\nThere was a time when I thought my career might be curved towards blogging full-time and running my own version of something like kottke.org. Through exploring that I found my way to what I really loved\u2014design and software. My work continues to benefit from what I learned studying bloggers and publishers online.\n\nWhether you care much about writing or not, I encourage you to have a blog. Write about what interests you, take great care of how you present it to the world, and you might be surprised where it takes you. There are new forms around every corner."}
{"url": "https://d.sb/2009/04", "origin": "https://d.sb/blog", "title": "Daniel15's Blog \u2014 Daniel15", "content": "So, I was reading the news today, and came across\n\n. It states:\n\nTHE NSW Federal Court has not ruled out the possibility that an ISP could be in direct breach of copyright laws if\n\n.\n\nA group of copyright holders represented by the Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft (AFACT) put the claim to the court as a part of its copyright case against Perth-headquartered ISP iiNet.\n\nMost of AFACT\u2019s original claims against iiNet lodged with the court last year were based on allegations that the ISP indirectly breached their members\u2019 copyright. They alleged that iiNet effectively encouraged customers to engage in copyright breaches by failing to take steps to block illegal file sharing activity on its network.\n\nHowever, on February 19, AFACT lodged an amended statement of claim to the court containing new allegations that iiNet engaged in primary acts of copyright infringement alongside illegal file sharers\n\n.\n\n(bold by me)\n\nThis is totally stupid! Why should an ISP be responsible for the data it's carrying? Why is the electricity company not responsible? They're supplying the power to the systems mentioned, so they also provide services to people that illegally share files. What about the building company that built the houses/offices? They're responsible for housing the systems.\n\nThe thing is, ISPs\n\nknow what the data being transferred on their network actually is. Much like the postal service... When you send a letter to someone, they don't open your letter and read it, they just send it. If I send you a terrible analogy that makes you think \"oh my God, this guy needs to take lessons on writing\", that's not Australia Post's issue. The postal service, and the ISP, are just transport agents. They send mesages from one location to another, but are\n\nfor the\n\nof the messages. Saying that the ISP is responsible for illegal file sharers because their network is being used is like saying that VicRoads is responsible for criminals, because they're driving their cars on the roads. Clearly, this makes absolutely no sense. If you go to VicRoads and tell them to put tollbooths on the roads to identify every person driving to make sure they're not a criminal, they'd laugh at you. The ISPs should be doing the same thing \u2014 This is exactly what's being asked of them.\n\nAlso, the article said that the ISP would be responsible if \"\n\n\". How are they meant to know that individuals illegally share files? Note that ISPs\n\ndisconnect users they get copyright complaints about (how users are caught is a different issue altogether... Fake torrents and similar things. Might blog about this eventually). There's really no other way for them to know who illegally shares files. This sentence makes it sound like they want ISPs to add a \"Do you illegally share files\" tickbox on the registration form. \ud83d\ude1b\n\nAnd also, as Aaron\n\n, \"copyright theft\" makes no sense. The term they're actually looking for is \"copyright\n\n\". But, they seem to barely know what they're doing, so I guess the use of a nonsensical term makes sense in whatever magical land they're living in. A land where there's no Peer-to-Peer networks, and everyone pays for the latest crappy music albums and TV shows and whatever else exists. For now, the rest of us live in reality, where none of this filtering is possible.\n\n\u2014 Daniel\n\nWell, back to posting coding-related blog posts, for now anyways \ud83d\ude1b. Seeing as a lot of people seem to be confused by Object Oriented Programming, I thought I'd post a quick (or maybe not so quick) post about what OOP is, the main features, and how it can benefit you. This is paraphrased from an assignment I had on OOP last semester at university. I use C# code examples throughout this, but the concepts are very similar in other languages. Note that in this post, I assume you know the basics of programming, and just want to learn more about object orientation.\n\nNow, let's begin looking at what OOP actually means. At its core, the Object Oriented paradigm consists of\n\nand\n\n. A class is a \u201cthing\u201d or entity that has a purpose, and an\n\nis an instance of this entity. For example, a Car would be a class, and\n\nwould be an object (instance of the Car class)."}

Things have been excellent so far, it's been really enjoyable. Last week, we made some\n\n. They were pretty much just plain lemon cookies based on a recipe from a $4 book we bought at Go-Lo, WITH A DIFFERENCE! We made them awesome by colouring them all different colours (and even made some multi-colour, which was my idea \ud83d\ude04). They were delicious\n\ncolourful and made with 100% awesomesauce. Next time we make some, we'll make them all rainbow I think xD.\n\nYesterday (Saturday), we went to\n\n, which is a science museum here in Melbourne. Well, we got there eventually. We had a few minor issues along the way. Firstly, we got off at Parliament Train Station (as the Metlink journey planner said to), and the platform that the train we needed usually comes to was closed, and there was a notice to go to Southern Cross Station. So, we went back to the platform we came from, and caught another train to Southern Cross. When we got to Southern Cross, the train took aaaages to come (then again, it's the Weribee line so it's kinda expected I guess \ud83d\ude1b). And then there was another complication \u2014 The train terminated at Footscray and we had to take a replacement bus the rest of the way. However, once we caught that bus, we finally got there. Entry is free if you're a student, so that's definitely a bonus.\n\nWhile I've been to Scienceworks before, it was a long long time ago and I couldn't remember much of it. This time around it was pretty good and I found it quite interesting.  They had a toy exhibit, which was\n\n! They had a roller coaster made out of\n\nwhich was very nice. I want one!! Get me one please? I'm such a child at times, I don't think that'll ever change \ud83d\ude04. Anyways, there was also other exhibits like a flight simulator, a kitchen thingy and a nice fire show (with demonstrations, Aaron would have loved it xD). There's also a planetarium there, but we didn't go this time (maybe we'll go next time). And we also went to the store there, and bought some glow-in-the-dark stars (which we stuck all over the roof in our room \ud83d\ude04). All in all, it was a very fun day, I really enjoyed it! Was definitely worth the $0 entry to Scienceworks, hahaha \ud83d\ude1b.\n\nAs for work, things are going very good. Since I just passed the six month mark for my IBL placement, I moved from the technical support team at work into one of the development teams. We've been working on improving our products by making commonly-requested upgrades. When clients would like functionality that is currently not available in our system, their request goes onto a wishlist. My team went through the wishlist, rated all the items based on priority, and started working on them. In just two weeks, we've completed heaps, and a few people are very happy \ud83d\ude04! I've also been doing a few other things, it's been quite good. I really enjoy my job! Also since it's about the half way mark now, my mid-placement report is nearly due. I've nearly finished it, just have to confirm that it's alright, and show it to my supervisor and see if he thinks it's alright.\n\nSo it's the start of another week tomorrow. I really miss Ciera during the day while I'm at work, but it's awesome coming home to her! Really makes me happy and makes everything I do worth it. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nUntil next time,\n\n\u2014 Daniel\n\nSo, my girlfriend Ciera came back to Melbourne last Saturday (26th June 2010)! We've been having a\n\ntime so far, I'm so very glad to see her again! I honestly don't think I would have been able to wait much longer, so I'm extremely happy that she came her when she did. It's been a week since she got here, and things have already been so amazing! I think she's been enjoying it here heaps (I know she loves it in Australia), and I've certainly enjoyed it. Today we just did a bit of shopping, nothing too big. Bought a bookshelf to put all our books and stuff on \ud83d\ude1b\n\nI can't wait for what the future is going to bring us!\n\nUntil next time,\n\n\u2014 Daniel"}
{"url": "https://dave.cheney.net/2020/02", "origin": "https://dave.cheney.net", "title": "February | 2020 | Dave Cheney", "content": ".\n\nSomething that I\u2019ve been thinking about a lot recently, when reflecting on the body of my own work, is a common subtitle,\n\nGiven nobody actively seeks to write\n\ncode, this leads to the question;\n\nIf there\u2019s a continuum between good and bad, how to do we know what the good parts are? What are its properties, its attributes, its hallmarks, its patterns, and its idioms?\n\nWhich brings me to idiomatic Go. To say that something is idiomatic is to say that it follows the style of the time. If something is not idiomatic, it is not following the prevailing style. It is unfashionable.\n\nMore importantly, to say to someone that their code is not idiomatic does not explain\n\nit\u2019s not idiomatic. Why is this? Like all truths, the answer is found in the dictionary.\n\nidiom (noun): a group of words established by usage as having a meaning not deducible from those of the individual words.\n\nIdioms are hallmarks of shared values. Idiomatic Go is not something you learn from a book, it\u2019s something that you acquire by being part of a community.\n\nMy concern with the mantra of idiomatic Go is, in many ways, it can be exclusionary. It\u2019s saying \u201cyou can\u2019t sit with us.\u201d After all, isn\u2019t that what we mean when critique of someone\u2019s work as non-idiomatic? They didn\u2019t do It right. It doesn\u2019t look right. It doesn\u2019t follow the style of time.\n\nI offer that idiomatic Go is not a suitable mechanism for teaching how to write good Go code because it is defined, fundamentally, by telling someone they did it wrong. Wouldn\u2019t it be better if the advice we gave didn\u2019t alienate the author right at the point they were most willing to accept it?\n\nStepping away problematic idioms, what other cultural artefacts do Gophers have? Perhaps we can turn to Rob Pike\u2019s wonderful\n\n. Are these suitable teaching tools? Will these tell newcomers how to write good Go code?\n\nIn general, I don\u2019t think so. This is not to dismiss Pike\u2019s work, it is just that the Go Proverbs, like Segoe Kensaku\u2019s original, are observations, not statements of value. Again, the dictionary comes to the rescue:\n\nproverb (noun): a short, well-known pithy saying, stating a general truth or piece of advice.\n\nThe goal of the Go Proverbs are to reveal a deeper truth about the design of the language, but how useful is advice like the\n\nto a novice from a language that doesn\u2019t have structural typing?\n\nIt\u2019s important to recognise that, in a growing community, at any time the people learning Go far outnumber those who claim to have mastered the language. Thus proverbs are perhaps not the best teaching tool in this scenario.\n\nDan Luu found\n\nby Mark Lucovsky about the engineering culture of the windows team around the windows NT-windows 2000 timeframe. The reason I mention it is Lukovsky\u2019s description of a culture as a common way of evaluating designs and making tradeoffs.\n\nThere are many ways of discussing culture, but with respect to an engineering culture Lucovsky\u2019s description is apt. The central idea is\n\n. The values of the NT team were; portability, reliability, security, and extensibility. Engineering values are, crudely translated, the way things are done around here.\n\nWhat are the explicit values of Go? What are the core beliefs or philosophy that define the way a Go programmer interprets the world? How are they promulgated? How are they taught? How are they enforced? How do they change over time?\n\nHow will you, as a newly minted Go programmer, inculcate the engineering values of Go? Or, how will you, a seasoned Go professional promulgate your values to a future generations? And just so we\u2019re clear, this process of knowledge transfer is not optional. Without new blood and new ideas, our community become myopic and wither.\n\nTo set the scene for what I\u2019m getting at we can look to other languages we see examples of their engineering values.\n\nFor example, C++ (and by extension Rust) believe that a programmer\n\n. If a program does not use some computationally expensive feature of the language, then it shouldn\u2019t be forced to shoulder the cost of that feature. This value extends from the language, to its standard library, and is used as a yardstick for judging the design of all code written in C++.\n\nIn Java, and Ruby, and Smalltalk, the core value that\n\ndrives the design of programs around message passing, information hiding, and polymorphism. Designs that shoehorn a procedural style, or even a functional style, into these languages are considered to be wrong\u2013or as Gophers would say, non idiomatic.\n\nTurning to our own community, what are the engineering values that bind Go programmers? Discourse in our community is often fractious, so deriving a set of values from first principles would be a formidable challenge. Consensus is critical, but exponentially more difficult as the number of contributors to the discussion increases. But what if someone had done the hard work for us.\n\nSeveral decades ago Tim Peters sat down and penned\n\n, the Zen of Python. Peters\u2019 attempted to document the engineering values that he saw Guido van Rossum apply in his role as BDFL for Python.\n\nFor the remainder of this article, I\u2019m going to look towards the Zen of Python and ask, is there anything that can inform the engineering values of Go programmers?\n\nLet\u2019s start with something spicy,\n\n\u201cNamespaces are one honking great idea\u2013let\u2019s do more of those!\u201d\n\nThis is pretty unequivocal, Python programmers should use namespaces. Lots of them.\n\nIn Go parlance a namespace is a package. I doubt there is any question that grouping things into packages is good for design and potentially reuse. But there might be some confusion, especially if you\u2019re coming with a decade of experience in another language, about the right way to do this.\n\nIn Go each package should have a purpose, and the best way to know a package\u2019s purpose is by its name\u2014a noun. A package\u2019s name describes what it provides. So too reinterpret Peters\u2019 words, every Go package should have a single purpose.\n\nThis is not a new idea,\n\n, but why should you do this rather than approach where packages are used for fine grained taxonomy? Why, because change.\n\n\u201cDesign is the art of arranging code to work today, and be changeable forever.\u201d\n\nChange is the name of the game we\u2019re in. What we do as programmers is manage change. When we do that well we call it design, or architecture. When we do it badly we call it technical debt, or legacy code.\n\nIf you are writing a program that works perfectly, one time, for one fixed set of inputs then nobody cares if the code is good or bad because ultimately the output of the program is all the business cares about.\n\nBut this is\n\ntrue. Software has bugs, requirements change, inputs change, and very few programs are written solely to be executed once, thus your program\n\nchange over time. Maybe it\u2019s you who\u2019ll be tasked with this, more likely it will be someone else, but someone has to change that code. Someone has to maintain that code.\n\nSo, how can we make it easy to for programs to change? Interfaces everywhere? Make everything mockable? Pernicious dependency injection? Well, maybe, for some classes of programs, but not many, those techniques will be useful. However, for the majority of programs, designing something to be flexible up front is over engineering.\n\nWhat if, instead, we take a position that rather than enhancing components, we replace them. Then the best way to know when something needs to be replaced, is when it doesn\u2019t do what it says on the tin.\n\nA good package starts with choosing a good name. Think of your package\u2019s name as an elevator pitch, using just one word, to describe what it provides. When the name no longer matches the requirement, find a replacement.\n\n\u201cSimple is better than complex.\u201d\n\nPEP-20 says simple is better than complex, I couldn\u2019t agree more. A couple of years ago I made this tweet;\n\nMy observation, at least at the time, was that I couldn\u2019t think of a language introduced in my life time that didn\u2019t purport to be simple. Each new language offered as a justification, and an enticement, their inherent simplicity. But as I researched, I found that simplicity was not a core value of the many of the languages considered Go\u2019s contemporaries.\n\nMaybe this is just a cheap shot, but could it be that either these languages aren\u2019t simple, or they don\u2019t\n\nof themselves as being simple. They don\u2019t consider simplicity to be a core value.\n\nCall me old fashioned, but when did being simple fall out of style? Why does the commercial software development industry continually, gleefully, forget this fundamental truth?\n\n\u201cThere are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult.\u201d\n\nSimple does not mean easy, we know that. Often it is more work to make something simple to use, than easy to build.\n\n\u201cSimplicity is prerequisite for reliability.\u201d\n\nWhy should we strive for simplicity? Why is important that Go programs be simple? Simple doesn\u2019t mean crude, it means readable and maintainable. Simple doesn\u2019t mean unsophisticated, it means reliable, relatable, and understandable.\n\n\u201cControlling complexity is the essence of computer programming.\u201d\n\nWhether Python abides by its mantra of simplicity is a matter for debate, but Go holds simplicity as a core value. I think that we can all agree that when it comes to Go, simple code is preferable to clever code.\n\n\u201cExplicit is better than implicit.\u201d\n\nThis is a place where I think Peters\u2019 was more aspirational than factual. Many things in Python are not explicit; decorators, dunder methods, and so on. Without doubt they are powerful, there\u2019s a reason those features exists. Each feature is something someone cared enough about to do the work to implement it, especially the complicated ones. But heavy use of those features makes is harder for the reader to predict the cost of an operation.\n\nThe good news is we have a choice, as Go programmers, to choose to make our code explicit. Explicit could mean many things, perhaps you may be thinking explicit is just a nice way of saying bureaucratic and long winded, but that\u2019s a superficial interpretation. It\u2019s a misnomer to focus only on the syntax on the page, to fret about line lengths and DRYing up expressions. The more valuable, in my opinon, place to be explicit are to do with coupling and with state.\n\nCoupling is a measure of the amount one thing depends on another. If two things are tightly coupled, they move together. An action that affects one is directly reflected in another. Imagine a train, each carriage joined\u2013ironically the correct word is coupled\u2013together; where the engine goes, the carriages follow.\n\nAnother way to describe coupling is the word cohesion. Cohesion measures how well two things naturally belong together. We talk about a cohesive argument, or a cohesive team; all their parts fit together as if they were designed that way.\n\nWhy does coupling matter? Because just like trains, when you need to change a piece of code, all the code that is tightly coupled to it must change. A prime example, someone release a new version of their API and now your code doesn\u2019t compile.\n\nAPIs are an unavoidable source of coupling but there are more insidious forms of coupling. Clearly everyone knows that if an API\u2019s signature changes the data passing into and out of that call changes. It\u2019s right there in the signature of the function; I take values of these types and return values of other types. But what if the API passed data another way? What if every time you called this API the result was based on the previous time you called that API even though you didn\u2019t change your parameters.\n\nThis is state, and management of state is\n\nproblem in computer science.\n\nSuppose we have this simple\n\npackage. You can call\n\nto increment the counter, you can even get the value back if you\n\nwith a value of zero.\n\nSuppose you had to test this code, how would you reset the counter after each test? Suppose you wanted to run those tests in parallel, could you do it? Now suppose that you wanted to count more than one thing per program, could you do it?\n\nNo, of course not. Clearly the answer is to encapsulate the\n\nvariable in a type.\n\nNow imagine that this problem isn\u2019t restricted to just counters, but your applications main business logic. Can you test it in isolation? Can you test it in parallel? Can you use more than one instance at a time? If the answer those question is\n\n, the reason is package level state.\n\nAvoid package level state. Reduce coupling and spooky action at a distance by providing the dependencies a type needs as fields on that type rather than using package variables.\n\n\u201cErrors should never pass silently.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been said of languages that favour exception handling follow the Samurai principle;\n\n. In exception based languages functions only return valid results. If they don\u2019t succeed then control flow takes an entirely different path.\n\nUnchecked exceptions are clearly an unsafe model to program in. How can you possibly write code that is robust in the presence of errors when you don\u2019t know which statements could throw an exception? Java tried to make exceptions safer by introducing the notion of a checked exception which, to the best of my knowledge, has not been repeated in another mainstream language. There are plenty of languages which use exceptions but they all, with the singular exception of Java, do so in the unchecked variety.\n\nObviously Go chose a different path. Go programmers believe that robust programs are composed from pieces that handle the failure cases\n\nthey handle the happy path. In the space that Go was designed for; server programs, multi threaded programs, programs that handle input over the network, dealing with unexpected data, timeouts, connection failures and corrupted data must be front and centre of the programmer\u2019s mind if they are to produce robust programs.\n\n\u201cI think that error handling should be explicit, this should be a core value of the language.\u201d\n\nI want to echo Peter\u2019s assertion, as it was the impetus for this article. I think so much of the success of Go is due to the explicit way errors are handled. Go programmers thinks about the failure case first. We solve the \u201cwhat if\u2026\u200b\u201d case first. This leads to programs where failures are handled at the point of writing, rather than the point they occur in production.\n\nThe verbosity of\n\nis outweighed by the value of deliberately handling each failure condition at the point at which they occur. Key to this is the cultural value of handling each and every error explicitly.\n\n\u201cFlat is better than nested.\u201d\n\nThis is sage advice coming from a language where indentation is the primary form of control flow. How can we interpret this advice in terms of Go?\n\ncontrols the overall whitespace of a Go program so there\u2019s not thing doing there.\n\nI wrote earlier about package names, and there is probably some advice here about avoiding a complicated package hierarchy. In my experience the more a programmer tries to subdivide and taxonimise their Go codebase the more they risk hitting the dead end that is package import loops.\n\nI think the best application of item 5\u2019s advice is the control flow\n\na function. Simply put, avoid control flow that requires deep indentation.\n\n\u201cLine of sight is a straight line along which an observer has unobstructed vision.\u201d\n\nMat Ryer describes this idea as line of sight coding. Light of sight coding means things like:\n\nKey to this advice is the thing that you care about, the thing that the function does, is never in danger of sliding out of sight to the right of your screen. This style has a bonus side effect that you\u2019ll avoid pointless arguments about line lengths on your team.\n\nEvery time you indent you add another precondition to the programmers stack, consuming one of their 7 \u00b12 short term memory slots. Rather than nesting deeply, keep the successful path of the function close to the left hand side of your screen.\n\n\u201cIn the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.\u201d\n\nProgramming is based on mathematics and logic, two concepts which rarely involve the element of chance. But there are many things we, as programmers, guess about every day. What does this variable do? What does this parameter do? What happens if I pass\n\nhere? What happens if I call\n\ntwice? There\u2019s actually a lot of guesswork in modern programming, especially when it comes to using libraries you didn\u2019t write.\n\n\u201cAPIs should be easy to use and hard to misuse.\u201d\n\nOne of the best ways I know to help a programmer avoid having to guess is to, when building an API,\n\n. Make it as easy as you can for the caller to do the most common thing. However, I\u2019ve written and talked a lot about API design in the past, so instead my interpretation of item 12 is;\n\n.\n\nDespite how you may feel about Knuth\u2019s advice, one of the drivers of Go\u2019s success is its efficient execution. You can write efficient programs in Go and thus people\n\nchoose Go because of this. There are a lot of misconceptions about performance, so my request is, when you\u2019re looking to performance tune your code or you\u2019re facing some dogmatic advice like defer is slow, CGO is expensive, or always use atomics not mutexes, don\u2019t guess.\n\nDon\u2019t complicate your code because of outdated dogma, and, if you think something is slow, first prove it with a benchmark. Go has excellent benchmarking and profiling tools that come in the distribution for free. Use them to find your bottlenecks.\n\nAt this point I think I think I\u2019ve mined the valuable points from PEP-20 and possibly stretched its reinterpretation beyond the point of good taste. I think that\u2019s fine, because although this was a useful rhetorical device, ultimately we are talking about two different languages.\n\n\u201cYou type g o, a space, and then a function call. Three keystrokes, you can\u2019t make it much shorter than that. Three keystrokes and you\u2019ve just started a sub process.\u201d\n\nThe next two suggestions I\u2019ll dedicate to goroutines. Goroutines are the signature feature of the language, our answer for first class concurrency. They are so easy to use, just put the word\n\nin front of the statement and you\u2019ve launched that function asynchronously. It\u2019s so simple, no threads, no stack sizes, no thread pool executors, no ID\u2019s, no tracking completion status.\n\nGoroutines are cheap. Because of the runtime\u2019s ability to multiplex goroutines onto a small pool of threads (which you don\u2019t have to manage), hundreds of thousands, millions of goroutines are easily accommodated. This opens up designs that would be not be practical under competing concurrency models like threads or evented callbacks.\n\nBut as cheap as goroutines are, they\u2019re not free. At a minimum there\u2019s a few kilobytes for their stack, which, when you\u2019re getting up into the 10^6 goroutines, does start to add up. This is not to say you shouldn\u2019t use millions of goroutines if that is what the design calls for, but when you do, it\u2019s critical that you keep track of them because 10^6 of anything can consume a non trivial amount of resources in aggregate.\n\nGoroutines are the key to resource ownership in Go. To be useful a goroutine has to do something, and that means it almost always holds reference to, or ownership of, a resource; a lock, a network connection, a buffer with data, the sending end of a channel. While that goroutine is alive, the lock is held, the network connection remains open, the buffer retained and the receivers of the channel will continue to wait for more data.\n\nThe simplest way to free those resources is to tie them to the lifetime of the goroutine\u2013when the goroutine exits, the resource has been freed. So while it\u2019s near trivial to start a goroutine, before you write those three letters, g o and a space, make sure you have an answer to these questions:\n\nIt is likely that in any serious Go program you write there will be concurrency involved. This raises the problem, many of the libraries and code that we write fall into this a one goroutine per connection, or worker pattern. How will you manage the lifetime of those goroutines?\n\nis a prime example. Shutting down the server owning the listening socket is relatively straight forward, but what about a goroutines spawned from that accepting socket?\n\ndoes provide a context object inside the request object which can be used to signal\u2013to code that is listening\u2013that the request should be canceled, thereby terminating the goroutine, however it is less clear how to know when all of these things have been done. It\u2019s one thing to call\n\n, its another to know that the cancellation has completed.\n\nThe point I want to make about\n\nis that its a counter example to good practice. Because each connection is handled by a goroutine spawned inside the\n\ntype, the program, living outside the\n\npackage, does not have an ability to control the goroutines spawned for the accepting socket.\n\nThis is an area of design that is still evolving, with efforts like go-kit\u2019s\n\nand the Go team\u2019s\n\nwhich provide a framework to execute, cancel and wait on functions run asynchronously.\n\nThe bigger design maxim here is for library writers, or anyone writing code that could be run asynchronously, leave the responsibility of starting to goroutine to your caller. Let the caller choose how they want to start, track, and wait on your functions execution.\n\nPerhaps you were hoping to read an article from me where I didn\u2019t rant about testing. Sadly, today is not that day.\n\nYour tests are the contract about what your software does and does not do. Unit tests at the package level should lock in the behaviour of the package\u2019s API. They describe, in code, what the package promises to do. If there is a unit test for each input permutation, you have defined the contract for what the code will do\n\n, not documentation.\n\nThis is a contract you can assert as simply as typing\n\n. At any stage, you can\n\nwith a high degree of confidence, that the behaviour people relied on before your change continues to function after your change.\n\nTests lock in api behaviour. Any change that adds, modifies or removes a public api must include changes to its tests.\n\nGo is a simple language, only 25 keywords. In some ways this makes the features that are built into the language stand out. Equally these are the features that the language sells itself on, lightweight concurrency, structural typing.\n\nI think all of us have experienced the confusion that comes from trying to use all of Go\u2019s features at once. Who was so excited to use channels that they used them as much as they could, as often as they could? Personally for me I found the result was hard to test, fragile, and ultimately overcomplicated. Am I alone?\n\nI had the same experience with goroutines, attempting to break the work into tiny units I created a hard to manage hurd of Goroutines and ultimately missed the observation that most of my goroutines were always blocked waiting for their predecessor\u2013\u2009the code was ultimately sequential and I had added a lot of complexity for little real world benefit. Who has experienced something like this?\n\nI had the same experience with embedding. Initially I mistook it for inheritance. Then later I recreated the fragile base class problem by composing complicated types, which already had several responsibilities, into more complicated mega types.\n\nThis is potentially the least actionable piece of advice, but one I think is important enough to mention. The advice is always the same, all things in moderation, and Go\u2019s features are no exception. If you can, don\u2019t reach for a goroutine, or a channel, or embed a struct, anonymous functions, going overboard with packages, interfaces for everything, instead prefer simpler approach rather than the clever approach.\n\nI want to close with one final item from PEP-20,\n\n\u201cReadability Counts.\u201d\n\nSo much has been said, about the importance of readability, not just in Go, but all programming languages. People like me who stand on stages advocating for Go use words like simplicity, readability, clarity, productivity, but ultimately they are all synonyms for one word\u2013\n\n.\n\nThe real goal is to write maintainable code. Code that can live on after the original author. Code that can exist not just as a point in time investment, but as a foundation for future value. It\u2019s not that readability doesn\u2019t matter, maintainability matters\n\n.\n\nGo is not a language that optimises for clever one liners. Go is not a language which optimises for the least number of lines in a program. We\u2019re not optimising for the size of the source code on disk, nor how long it takes to type the program into an editor. Rather, we want to optimise our code to be clear to the reader. Because its the reader who\u2019s going to have to maintain this code.\n\nIf you\u2019re writing a program for yourself, maybe it only has to run once, or you\u2019re the only person who\u2019ll ever see it, then do what ever works for you. But if this is a piece of software that more than one person will contribute to, or that will be used by people over a long enough time that requirements, features, or the environment it runs in may change, then your goal must be for your program to be maintainable. If software cannot be maintained, then it will be rewritten; and that could be the last time your company will invest in Go.\n\nCan the thing you worked hard to build be maintained after you\u2019re gone? What can you do today to make it easier for someone to maintain your code tomorrow?"}

In fact there is no goal - other than to use your skills and creativity to make someone's life a little bit better.\n\nSince quitting my job last year to do my own thing I've experienced a lot of ups and downs.

You can read the\n\nbut basically a honeycomb shaped kids' shoebox I saw at a farm gave me the inspiration I needed.\n\nThe idea was that the stickers could be arranged however you wanted in a hexagon grid, with stickers taking up either one, two, or three hexagons.\n\nOnce the designs were done, I happily sent them off to Stickermule for printing. But when the samples came back the stickers didn't snap together like they were supposed to:\n\nTheir customer support people were super patient with me over the course of our 80 emails back and forth.

I slogged through it and at length finished my new r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nI sent it out to a couple of companies that looked fun to work for but my mind remained fixed on the Flexbox question. At work the next day I decided to cowboy up and get the form over with. The company had recently -\n\n- dropped IE9 support (enterprise amiright?) so I tackled it with Flexbox, scoring some more traffic/ad revenue for the css-tricks guys. After trying random, failing combinations of\n\n,\n\n, and\n\nI had had enough.\n\n\u2014 I said to myself \u2014\n\n.\n\nI dove head first into the\n\nspec. I read it all the way through - with a growing sense of dread that I had made a terrible life decision to become a UI dev. I might as well have read a manual on Thermodynamics for all I got out of it.\n\nMorale only mostly shattered, I headed over to codepen and started playing around with Flexbox. I experimented, tweaked, watched the changes as I made them. I wrote down any questions that came to mind while I tinkered. And gradually things started to\n\n. I became\n\nwith Flexbox. Most days I'd try to get my work done extra fast so I'd have some time to\n\nwith it, to learn even more.\n\nI went back and re-read the Flexbox spec and this time it made perfect sense. The craziest part is I found\n\n. I didn't realize it at the time but I had accidentally discovered a critical aspect to loving work.\n\nI started getting requests from coworkers to help them with Flexbox. So I shared the metaphors for understanding Flexbox concepts that I had come up for myself for remembering things:\n\nPicture you're holding a crossbow and aiming either North, East, South, or West. That's\n\n. These zombies (flex items) are coming from the south, so set your crossbow to\n\n.\n\nThe people I helped\n\nthis way of thinking about Flexbox. They convinced me to create a little tutorial on it. Flexbox Zombies v1 was born.\n\nIt started as a little prototoype. I made a simple text-based email sequence with some codepen exercises that looked like this:\n\nI launched the project and refreshed my email list frequently to see if anybody on the interwebs had signed up. Pretty much just my friends and people from work, but oh well I thought, it was fun to make.\n\nOne morning I checked and saw that three hundred people had signed up. I was shocked and ecstatic. It turned out some of my popular friends (\n\n,\n\n) had shared my creation on Twitter. I had been wanting to do my own thing for years, had even stockpiled a decent savings but was still\n\n\u2014 too afraid to make the leap. But this small win was all the excuse I needed. I put in my two weeks notice and set out on my own to create the full on\n\nMastery Game:\n\nI decided to keep this game free, with the hopes that people would love it and would want to support me by buying my next game. To date over 80,000 people have signed up and learned Flexbox with me.\n\nAfter shipping that I announced a preorder for my first paid game:\n\nwhich helps people internalize CSS Grid layout.\n\nTo my utter delight, hundreds of devs dropped their hard-earned cash monies on this new Mastery Game. Including engineers from Microsoft, Github, Google and Apple. I was completely floored. But what's awesome about all of this isn't\n\n\u2014 but the highly valuable principle I discovered along the way.\n\nBy facing down the Flexbox dragon I inadvertently stumbled onto a key principle of learning:\n\n. Learning through play is more fun, easier to get yourself to actually do, and much more effective.\n\nDon't\n\n. Not ever really mastering your craft is\n\n. But it's numbing. It's like never venturing out of a game's starting zone. No wonder you're bored out of your mind fighting level 1 sheep. That's all you're capable of handling to this point, but you were made for so much more.\n\nSo here's my advice: start\n\n. Face the difficulty head on. Commit to\n\nfrontend development. It\n\nbe hard. Head down this path and yes - there be dragons. But you'll slay them and it will feel amazing. And a few things will happen:\n\nI've designed\n\nspecifically for you. Because you're like me \u2014 you're not content to be mediocre in your craft. Devs like us have too much passion to settle or coast.\n\nIt's time to\n\nyour frontend coding skills. Leverage this\n\nprinciple with my Mastery Game. It will guide you, challenge you, reward you. It's the ideal environment for\n\nwith CSS Grid. One where you get to actually\n\n. By the time you complete the hundreds of levels, you\n\nbe a master of CSS Grid layout.\n\nMaster CSS Grid right from the start by playing this new mastery\n    game. You'll learn the ins and outs of Grids one fun level at a time,\n    while saving an adorable alien life form from certain destruction."}

It worked fine on my machine so I shipped it. The feeling of shipping was amazing. I even took my wife and kids to dinner to celebrate the big launch! That's when I got the first email from one of my brand new students:\n\nHey Dave this looks awesome but it really bogs down my laptop, I'd love for it to actually work!\n\nI felt bad that she had such an \"old machine\", made a mental note to do some perf testing later, and went back to my sticky finger quesadillas. My phone buzzed again:\n\nWow I love the artwork! Unfortunately that's all I get to enjoy because it completely destroys my machine. I can't even use my mouse it's so bad.\n\nYou know that sinking feeling of dread you haven't felt since getting busted for starting a chemical fire as a kid? Just me? Ok well, let's just say I wasn't in the mood for dessert. Over the course of the next few days I received a lot of emails and direct\n\nmessages from people who were loving the Mastery Game, so at least it worked for some people. But I was heartbroken about the many others. I decided to pause the creation of the remaining levels to figure out what was causing such a big problem in my app.\n\nIt just so happened that I had a hack weekend scheduled with some friends, which turned out to be perfect for focusing on this problem. I dug into it more and learned - to my disappointment - that it wasn't going to be an easy fix at all.\n\nIt turned out the problem was with the way I was (ab)using WebGL. I had designed the game so that for each zombie in the level there was a DOM element containing a canvas with its own 3D context (highlighted in blue outline in the following screenshots). Same for the hoodie character.\n\nNow as the user enters code into the LCD screen a few things happen. Targets appear - each painted in their own (2D) canvas:\n\nOnce the user gets the answer right, the Hoodie character shoots the zombies and they're swapped out with a\n\ncanvas/context for a death animation:\n\nSo far that makes\n\n3D contexts and\n\n2D contexts, oh my. But it gets even worse. Every time you change the\n\n, the hoodie character aims in the appropriate direction, getting swapped out for... you guessed it. Another 3D context. Before long your computer realizes that the browser is asking for waaaaay too many resources and requests for additional resources get denied. The browser then has to make do with what it's got. So it\n\nthe oldest WebGL contexts in order to free things up for the new ones. When this is about to happen you see this delightful message in the devtools:\n\nWell this is bad when you kinda sorta need the thing on the screen that's about to get dumped. Fortunately you can react to this event and recreate all your textures etc in that poor unloved WebGL context. But it's expensive and if you're recovering contexts over and over it eventually overwhelms the CPU and brings the computer to its knees.\n\nOnce I understood what was happening the solution was obvious: only use a single canvas/context. All I had to do was\n\nand\n\n! It only took the geniuses who build browsers eight years to get it right, how hard could it be?\n\nAfter a good cry I went on the hack weekend trip and brainstormed some ideas with my brilliant/thoughtful friend\n\n. We prototyped a super interesting idea:\n\n. We were pleased to discover that this would do the trick quite nicely. Here's how it works:\n\nA component renders a regular, empty\n\nwhich gets controlled by regular CSS flexbox:\n\nWhen the component is mounted it\n\n(size & position) and draws its WebGL textures (the zombie/hoodie graphics) into the shared canvas at exactly the right spot!\n\nHide the divs' borders and BOOM!\n\n.\n\nThe app runs\n\nbetter now. Chrome takes about 11% CPU now as opposed to ~30% before. Memory usage is ~5MB lower going from level to level. The animations are also smoother. There is probably even more optimization I could do later. But hey, at least now flexbox zombies is safe to use on an airplane. Time to finish writing the rest of the story's chapters.\n\nIn hindsight it seems obvious that I was using WebGL/canvas wrong. But I also think that had I tried to something clever like this the first time around it would have just been a distraction from building out my Mastery Game idea, and would have taken a lot longer to ship. I'm a believer in\n\n.\n\nSolving the performance problems for\n\nwho were pumped to use something I had made was incredibly motivating. If I still hadn't shipped it I would still have been wondering if people even cared about what I was making, which would have made it really hard to sink another week into a rewrite of the core mechanics.\n\nNo matter how smart you are, you need good friends. People who aren't so close to the problems you're trying to solve and can therefore see them with fresh perspective. People who care enough to tell you when your baby is ugly, and then put in the time and energy to help you make it awesome.\n\nAm I sorry I shipped before it was perfect? Not one bit. A ton of people still loved it, and who knows? Maybe some devs were able to use this to prove to their bosses that they needed a new laptop :) It's still not perfect, which grates on a perfectionist like me. But I'm training myself to be more OK with the mindset that\n\n.\n\nOh and yeah, go easy on the WebGL :)\n\nFlexbox is incredibly powerful. But it's also crazy hard to master. So\n    we all end up depending on a cheat sheet and guessing in the dev\n    tools. Enough of that! Time to master it once and for all, in a way\n    that actually sticks, so you can build any layout you can imagine with\n    flexbox."}
{"url": "https://mastery.games/post/learn-to-draw/", "origin": "https://gedd.ski/", "title": "Learn to Draw", "content": "Programming can be fun and rewarding work, especially when what we're creating challenges us. But any difficult undertaking inevitably means hitting roadblocks. Getting stumped. Having no idea how to overcome the latest problem or how to proceed. Coding is about solving problems, one after another. One of the most valuable tools you can add to your problem-solving aresenal is the ability to draw.\n\nWhat does drawing have to do with solving problems? I'm taking a drawing course from renowned illustrator\n\nwhere he asks students this simple question:\n\nTo which he answers:\n\nDrawing is seeing. When you're seeing, you're observing. And when you're observing, you're asking questions. The right questions.\n\nThe process of drawing is the process of asking yourself questions. Usually when we get stuck on a problem we ask ourselves:\n\nBut in drawing, you throw out what you know and ask yourself the more helpful question:\n\nLearning to draw helps us see past our assumptions. Explanations our brains would have classified as \"not possible\" become on the table.\n\nOne time I was working on adding a new card size to my project at work. Because I'm\n\nat estimates, I thought it would take only a few minutes. I found where the other card sizes appeared to be defined, and added mine. I closed the ticket and went to lunch. I came back to the app completely busted in the dev environment. After a\n\nand bit of shame, I sat down to figure out what went wrong.\n\nAs it turned out, the card sizing feature was a fragile and complex beast summoned from the depths of hell. I tackled it the only way I knew how. I grabbed an 11x17 sheet of paper from the office supply closet and started digging through the code. As I discovered a useful clue, I'd sketch it out on my paper. A couple of hours later I had a diagram drawn that accurately illustrated how the feature worked. Once I understood it, changing it was a snap.\n\nAnother time I was working on lining up the user-controlled terrain items in\n\n. My boxes were slightly off and I didn't know why. So I did what has become a favorite technique of mine: I snapped a picture of my Mac's screen with my iPad's camera, and opened up the photo in a drawing app on the iPad.\n\nThat let me draw right on top of my UI. I asked myself what behavior I was\n\n, and what I\n\nit to be doing. With that clarity I was able to think through what was not quite right and quickly implement a solution.\n\nYou can't solve a problem you can't see clearly. In my experience the best way to see something clearly is to draw it out.\n\nDrawing helps you see not only\n\nproblems but\n\nones as well.\n\nPrototyping is nothing more than getting an idea out of your head so that it can answer a specific question. Drawing is the fastest form of prototyping and can answer most questions.\n\nIn my game I wanted little interceptor ships to fly out of the space ship and arrive at specific locations, based on the user's CSS Grid template & gaps. Before typing a single character of code, I drew this out:\n\nDrawing this helped me think through how I would build it: each ship would have three coordinates they would travel to:\n\nThen as I wrote and stepped through the code, I could refer often to a specific interceptor in my drawing and quickly see whether I was building it correctly.\n\nEven though this made me realize I'd forgetten pretty much everything from college trig class, I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. Here's the result in slow motion so you can see how the interceptors follow the paths:\n\nThis simple drawing didn't take long at all to think through and create. It answered my question, then it guided what I ultimately coded. I didn't need mocks or a requirements doc. Just the bit of seeing and thinking that comes whenever you draw.\n\nHere's another example of a prototype drawing: the chat panel UI I show how to build in\n\n.\n\nStart leveraging the power of drawing to solve problems. Don't fret if you don't currently consider yourself a \"visual thinker\" - that's something that will come as you train yourself to think visually by drawing.\n\nGetting good at drawing will really pay off in the long run, definitely something to add to your regular\n\n. Here's what I recommend for getting started:\n\nGo through the lessons on\n\n. They're completely free and start with the very basics. I'm going through these right now myself and have already seen an improvement in my skills.\n\nYou don't\n\nany digital tools for this but I've found the iPad/Apple Pencil to be compeletely awesome for this. I prefer this setup over something like a Wacom tablet, because you can take it with you on a walk or to the park\n\n. The best iOS app I've found so far is\n\nbecause of its infinite canvas. I also like\n\nfor freestyle drawing/painting.\n\nThe next time you find yourself solving a problem while coding - try drawing it!\n\nFlexbox is incredibly powerful. But it's also crazy hard to master. So\n    we all end up depending on a cheat sheet and guessing in the dev\n    tools. Enough of that! Time to master it once and for all, in a way\n    that actually sticks, so you can build any layout you can imagine with\n    flexbox."}

That guy who's always talking about starting his own business but who spends most of his free time playing Starcraft.\n\nOur actions always reveal our real values.\n\n\u2014 Derek Sivers\n\nIf this rings a bell and\n\n, it's possible that you don't actually\n\nto do your own thing. And that's OK! Absolutely nothing wrong with working with cool people at a 9 to 5.\n\nBut if you\n\nwant it, then there's really only one obstacle in your way:\n\n.\n\nI'm speaking from experience on this one. As soon as I decided to get real about my goal to do my own thing, my brain helpfully provided a billion reasons why I shouldn't. Here are just a few that may sound familiar to you:\n\nYou wonder how you'll pay the bills and feed yourself and your family. If you're being honest though you know you'd never actually let that happen and as developer you could pretty easily get\n\nkind of job. But you\n\nit would be a waste to save up soooo much cash just to bootstrap something that doesn't pan out. And you\n\nthat future disappointment of failing at this dream you worked so hard just to get the opportunity to take a shot at!\n\nNote: I don't recommend quitting your day job until you're either making enough on the side already to cover all your expenses or you've saved up a full year's runway. More on that in a future post.\n\n\"But what if my idea just plain sucks?\" Well it just might. But how will you ever know if you don't ship it? An amazing idea that never ships is more tragic than a classic French film. Buying into this fear is choosing to experience failure in advance.\n\nThis is a big one. Gary Vaynerchuck (one of my heroes) makes the case that most of the time our primary fear is to\n\n. The reality is they probably believe in you a lot more than you do! After watching Gary's video I asked my wife Melissa if she would be supportive of me doing my own thing even if I crashed and burned. Her response was gold to me: \"Oh my gosh honey I just want you to be happy and I've never doubted you for a second\". Somehow I had let my fear convince me that failure at entrepreneurship would be failure at marriage, which raised the stakes to unreasonable levels.\n\nPeople often point out \"hey, the worst that could happen is you get another day job!\". And while you agree with that assesment, the thought of failure still stings. You worry that people will somehow think lesser of you if you botch it.\n\n\"So many people are making amazing things already! How can I compete with them?\" Think about just one of the successful competitors in your space. Did the market have just one slot left before filling up and they took it? This is just that old fear again telling you you're not as good, not as smart, not as creative. Thanks a bunch, fear.\n\nOne of the saddest conversations I ever had was when I told a person about my upcoming adventure and at first he was smiling, reminiscing about a time ten years ago when he was about to try something similar. But his countenance fell as he recounted how he had decided to play it safe and stay at his \"miserable job\". He then sighed and repeated to me the words of his shoulder-dwelling fear angel: \"Anyway, I'm too old for that now\".\n\nIsn't it funny how badly we cling to things once we think we're about to give them up? Even things we\n\n. If I know I'm going to start a diet tomorrow suddenly those stale cheetos in the pantry look\n\n. The thought of quitting a decent, high paying job brings out this fear: \"will I ever have something this good again?\". It's really the same fear as the age one: \"you've reached your peak, it's only downhill from here.\" It can be hard to give up the easy, comfortable life.\n\nAll our reasons not to try really just boil down to fear. The nice thing about fear is you're already fully equiped to obliterate it. You just need to know how.\n\nHere's the formula I used for overcoming all of these fears and making the leap to do my own thing:\n\nThe first step is to acknowledge the fear. Don't pretend it doesn't exist or try to downplay it. It's real and it's crippling you like a three-year-old clinging to your leg as you try to walk. It helps to\n\n. To see it on a piece of paper and be like \"yep, that's what I'm worried about\". As a super personal example, this one's been my biggest fear:\n\nI'm afraid I won't make enough money to keep doing what I love.\n\nOnce you write down the fear, it helps to\n\n. I call this particular one the good old\n\n. Once something has a name/label it becomes easier to recognize when you're being influenced by it. Instead of a vague cloud of worry keeping you from feeling excited you can pinpoint it and say \"oh yeah, I'm feeling the cash anxiety right now\".\n\nNaming your fear/emotion is one of the most useful aspects of mindfulness:\n\nThere is a simple technique for self-regulation called \u201caffect labeling,\u201d which simply means labeling feelings with words. When you label an emotion you are experiencing (for example, \u201cI feel anger\u201d), it somehow helps you manage that emotion.\n\n\u2014 Chade-Meng Tan, Search Inside Yourself\n\nI wonder if Chade-Meng Tan realized how\n\nit is that he named the act of naming things. In any case, \"affect labeling\" is powerful and gives you a solid pin to spear right into the center of your fear.\n\nOnce you've clearly identified the fear and given it a name, the next step is to imagine a situation where that fear is completely nonexistent. A scenario in which it would be downright silly for that fear to try its tricks on you. For example if you're worried about having a good enough idea, imagine a scenario where you're getting\n\nfrom actual paying customers raving about how your product/idea improves their lives. If you're worried about money imagine yourself making 30k a month doing what you love. Don't use that S.M.A.R.T. goal garbage - right now you want to\n\n.\n\nYou must set targets that are 10 times what you think you want and then do 10 times what you think it will take to accomplish those targets. Massive thoughts must be followed by massive actions.\n\n\u2014 Grant Cardone, The 10X Rule\n\nThis ideal scenario - as lofty and crazy as it might sound to your friends when you tell them - is a place where your fear simply can't exist. This scenario is now your new\n\n. Write it down right next to the fear. Associate it in your mind with the fear, so that any time you feel the fear you are immediately reminded of the Guiding Star you're working towards.\n\nOnce you've named your fear and know what the exact opposite - your guiding star - looks like, it's time to start sailing towards it. This is the most important step.\n\n. And worrying isn't going to help - it just feeds your fear. Same with waiting. The only way through the fear is to take action towards that guiding star. You won't get there overnight. Or in a month and probably not even in a year. When you arrive doesn't really matter so don't try to\n\n. Instead, set little goals that lead you one at a time towards the gigantic goal. You'll get to celebrate tiny wins along the way.\n\nMy main Guiding Star right now is to build up my audience of UI devs. I'm doing it by helping UI nerds like myself master UI tech, so they can build amazing stuff and land the best jobs. With a massive goal of 10,000 devs taped to my wall I decided I was done standing on the edge of the cliff with my wing suit strapped to my back. I took deep breath and jumped! I quit my job and created\n\n- a free Mastery Game where you shoot zombies with a crossbow controlled by flexbox. I had probably been watching too much Walking Dead when I came up with the idea. Anyway, even though my guiding star is 10,000 students my first little goal was just 100. I was absolutely\n\nwhen I hit it! So I set a new little goal of 500 students. My kids cheered and celebrated with me when I reached it (they really have no idea what it means but they like the zombies). So on to 1,000. Then 2,000. Then 5,000. Then 7,000. I've recently passed 18,000 and am going strong. Hitting these smaller goals along the way to my guiding star is making all the difference.\n\nDon't feel like you need to map out every little goal in between where you're at now and where you want to end up. You only need to come up with the one next small goal that moves you a little closer to your Guiding Star. Each time you reach a little goal you'll have a better idea what your next one should be.\n\nFollowing these steps has helped me overcome a ton of fears and finally take my shot at doing my own thing. If you're wanting to do the same I hope this helps, and I'd love to hear your story. My\n\ndirect messages are always open.\n\nFirst\n\nwhether you really want to do your own thing. If you do, then write down a\n\n/reasons why you're not already doing it or making progress towards it. Give each fear a\n\n. For your biggest fear write down and tape your wall a new\n\n- a gigantic goal that would obliterate that fear. Set your first\n\nthat moves you one step closer to that destination and\n\non it\n\n."}
{"url": "https://mastery.games/post/routine-success/", "origin": "https://gedd.ski/", "title": "Routine Success", "content": "This time of year can bring a lot of hope and encouragement, with fresh resolutions and clear ambitions. But it can also bring discouragement when you realize that you felt this same way last year but that excitement didn't translate into lasting change or meaningful results. Your resolutions fizzled out, again.\n\nI've been thinking a lot about what worked for me in 2017, and what didn't. I basically had two goals: start my own business and get in shape. I made incredible progress on the entrepreneur life: I quit my job, created Mastery Games for\n\nand for\n\n, wrote tons of\n\n, and grew my audience to over 11,000 UI devs. But I didn't do jack for my health. I'm still 30lbs overweight and my sleep schedule is terrible.\n\nWhat was the difference between my successful goal and my failure? I had them both hung up on my wall where I'd be reminded of them daily. They were equally high priority in my mind. What made me crush one goal and neglect the other?\n\nI realize now that there was only one small but important difference: I had\n\nfor accomplishing my entrepreneur goal. I had set aside time\n\nto work towards it. My \"get healthy\" goal remained wishful thinking and a source of constant guilt. But the biz stuff really took off as I applied constant, scheduled effort in the form of a daily routine.\n\nMy takeaway from this is that\n\n. Things worth doing take work, a lot of it. The best way to make sure you're giving your goals the steady effort they require is to design a routine around them.\n\nI've also learned that routines need to be anchored to a specific goal in order to carry enough meaning. A routine on its own is a rather empty thing, and can be very difficult to stick to if its not tied to an outcome you truly want. I've written about the importance of having a\n\nin\n\n. Pick a huge goal that will make a real difference in your life when you achieve it. For me this year I have two guiding stars: lose 30lbs and earn more income than I did at my \"real job\". These guiding stars give me context, meaning, and direction. I've designed a custom daily routine for sailing full mast towards them.\n\nSean Covey in\n\nmakes a distinction between \"lag measures\" and \"lead measures\". Lag measures are\n\n, outcomes/rewards that come to us after we put in the hard work. For example losing weight, hitting a savings target, or mastering a new skill. Lag measures are important to set our sights on. They're the guiding stars we sail towards. \"I'm going to become an amazing frontend developer - one who can build anything I can imagine\" is a perfect lag measure/goal. To get there though you need lead measures.\n\nA lead measure is something that is indicative of the lag measure. An action that if done consistently will lead to the end result you're after. Saving \\$300 per paycheck\n\nto hitting savings goals. Going to the gym every weekday\n\nto getting in shape.\n\nto skilled proficiency. You have direct control over lead measures. The key is to pick the right lead measures for your goal and then build them into your routine.\n\nI used to make goals like \"develop a drawing habit\". Not anymore. Habits are too vague and unpredictable. Does it take 60 days to make a habit? Six months? What does it take to sustain a habit? Who knows. Habits are more of an outcome that may or may not kick in at some point and make things easier. Not something you should bank on or even worry about now. A routine however is directly in your control. You can start a new routine tonight. You can choose to do your routine every single day. Eventually the habit fairy will come along and make doing your routine feel natural and require very little effort. In the meantime though, just go rock your routine.\n\nMy new routine starts at 10:00PM every night (a successful morning routine starts the night before). When 10PM rolls around I feel very little desire to shut my brain/computer down and start getting ready for bed. I remind myself that this is what it takes to get healthy and self-reliant, but going to brush my teeth sounds so lame in the moment compared to playing Overwatch. But as soon as I force myself to go do that first item on the routine, the\n\nand the rest of the routine is a piece of cake. Getting started is the hardest part. Because of this phenomenon I've changed my routine and no joke made petting my dog Sam the very first item in my nightly routine. Pick something easy and enjoyable as your first item to jumpstart your routine, and breeze past the hardest part of simply getting started.\n\nPick one or two guiding stars (no more). Something you\n\nwant to make happen this year. Something that would make a massive and awesome difference for you. Next decide on a couple of lead measures - actions that if done consistently will lead you to the outcome you want. Now build those actions into a daily routine. Stick to your routine - feel free to adjust/tweak it as you learn.

Every day I looked forward to my lunch break. I'd clock out, hop on my little Vespa scooter, and zoom home to my apartment. I'd wolf down a quick sandwich and log in to World of Warcraft.\n\n50 minutes left \u2014 had to make it count. Accept new quest. Equip new bow. Ready to take on the world, my pet bear Chewy and I set out to kill those 10 rats that had been tormenting the poor blacksmith.\n\nAfter making short work of the vermin, we returned to town to claim our reward. Gratitude, 20 coins and some decent new pants \u2014 not too shabby. But then the real reward came. A loud ding sound, a flash of light, and a dozen \"grats\" messages from the local chat.\n\nI had leveled up.\n\nI zipped back to work with 6 minutes left and a smile on my face.\n\nThose clever psychologists at Blizzard knew how to make addicting games by mimicking the real-world reward systems. When you level up in Warcraft you experience a huge boost of endorphins. Your character's base stats are all increased: more life, more damage, more mana. You can carry better weapons and equip stronger armor. You're ready to take on even bigger challenges.\n\nThere is nothing quite like that feeling of progress.\n\nIt takes more time and effort in real life, but when you put in the work towards mastering a new skill, you are transformed. Your brain's synapses are literally rewired for the accomplishment of that task in the future. The experience you gain\n\nyou\u2014 for the better.\n\nI used to struggle with CSS. I'd have to interrupt my work and look things up all the time. I got really tired of that crap and finally tackled the beast. It took the reading (and re-reading) of specs, studying blog posts/examples, and most of all\n\nwith the tech\u2014\u00a0building a\n\nof little projects myself. And I gradually leveled up. Now I feel so comfortable with CSS I don't even think about it while I work. I'm able to focus on the thing I'm building rather than the tools I use, and it feels incredible.\n\nI've designed my games (\n\nand\n\n) to help others attain this level of CSS mastery in the most fun way possible.\n\nOn the other hand, I currently feel like a n00b at the new thing I'm learning: TypeScript. I hit the limits of my skills with it daily. Feeling like a beginner again \u2014 getting stuck and frustrated \u2014 is a good sign! It means you're learning. The trick is to use every single one of these moments as an opportunity to\n\n. Don't just google the answer and paste it in, that won't\n\nyou one bit. Study the thing that stumped you. Take the time to understand\n\nthe solution works. Sure, getting unstuck is your goal. But try to transform yourself into the person who gets\n\nunstuck. Over time you'll hit fewer and fewer snags as your mastery over the skill develops.\n\nJust like in video games, this leveling up brings with it many new possibilities. For starters you can learn additional things that would have previously been over your head. You become able to build more advanced, complex and delightful creations. Your ability to appreciate and learn from the fine work of others is refined. Your creativity centers have more raw materials to work with, expanding your imagination and ability to generate original ideas. And of course, you can earn more money because you are more skilled at your craft. But as a wise man once said\n\n.\n\nNothing generates motivation like the pursuit (and use) of mastery. It's incredibly rewarding to witness your own transformation as you put in the effort. No dings sound, no light rays beam all around you, but you can feel yourself leveling up. Your inner drive getting replenished. Making progress on the road to mastery adds logs to the flame of your\n\n.\n\nPeople often think it goes the other way around.\n\n. But then they wonder why they can't seem to stick to a plan long enough to get really good. Don't wait around for motivation to strike (it won't). Generate it yourself by setting out on the path of mastery.\n\nIn Dan Pink's excellent book\n\nhe lists the three key ingredients of genuine motivation: autonomy, mastery, and purpose.\n\nMastery is a mindset: It requires the capacity to see your abilities not as finite, but as infinitely improvable. Mastery is a pain: It demands effort, grit, and deliberate practice.\n\n\u2014 Dan Pink\n\nYou're never going to feel motivated on a project where you're not getting good at something that matters to you. Motivation only flows naturally when:\n\nMastery is a key ingredient of motivation, and the one over which you have the most control.\n\nThe happiness of a man in this life does not consist in the absence but in the mastery of his passions.\n\n\u2014 Alfred Lord Tennyson\n\nAt first it takes hard work, pure and simple. But as you progress you begin to enjoy the skill you've worked hard to master. As your motivation shifts from extrinsic to intrinsic, the work itself becomes a reward.\n\nWhen you're first learning to draw, it takes steady discipline and constant practice. But eventually drawing becomes a resource for you, something you do for the simple enjoyment of it. I'll write more about this\n\nmotivation in a future post.\n\nOne of my favorite audiobooks of all time is\n\nby Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. His life's study was to observe and figure out what makes people happy. He concluded that it isn't their leisure time, but rather their time spent in the state of flow that gives people the most joy and fulfillment.\n\nContrary to what we usually believe, moments like these, the best moments in our lives, are not the passive, receptive, relaxing times\u2014although such experiences can also be enjoyable, if we have worked hard to attain them. The best moments usually occur when a person's body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult or worthwhile. Optimal experience is thus something that we make happen.\n\nCsikszentmihalyi discovered that happiness comes from the process of intentionally focusing everything you've got on one thing at a time. On narrowing in and deliberately progressing along the path of mastery.\n\nAre you ready to commit yourself to the path of mastery? To finally become amazing at the skills your heart is drawn to? Transformation, opportunities, motivation and happiness will be your loot if you're willing to put in the work.\n\nPick up\n\nand I'll guide you to master CSS Grid \u2014 the best thing to ever happen to CSS and the single most important skill a modern web dev needs to master.\n\nMaster CSS Grid right from the start by playing this new mastery\n    game.

{"url": "https://mastery.games/post/solve-it-once/", "origin": "https://gedd.ski/", "title": "Solve It Once", "content": "I have an awesome little Manchester Terrier named Sam. She's the best dog a guy could ask for. Good with the kids, isn't yappy or annoying like most small dogs, loves to play and keeps my knees warm during shows. But Sam has one major downside: like most Terriers, she loves to\n\n.\n\nNeighborhood kids come over?\n\nshe's out the door and enjoying her adventure before the first cuss word can form in my mind. Whenever I need to go check the mail I'll carefully scan the living room, making sure the beast is nowhere in sight. But as soon as I open that front door just three inches, she appears out of nowhere and dashes through.\n\nI've put up with my little escapist for\n\n. FIVE YEARS. During which I made several half-hearted attempts at solving the problem. More walks, dog training, neighbor training, signs, etc. Nothing worked and I'd just go back to dealing with it. This last year since working from home it got especially annoying. I'd be working in my office, finally in that precious\n\nwhen all of a sudden from out my window I hear a distant\n\nFlow shattered, I'd grumble and retrieve my dog. It finally broke me - I\n\nto fix the Sam problem.\n\nI set my mind to solving this blasted problem once and for all, and there was nothing in the world that could stop me. I brainstormed all sorts of ideas, the majority of which were legal and humane. I bought one of those electric shock collars but couldn't bring myself to using it on her. I tried a non-hurty sonar one that supposedly produces a dog-repelling sound at close proximity - talk about a scam. I even entertained the idea of inventing some kind of dog-catching robot.\n\nFinally I realized that if my brain couldn't defeat my pup, perhaps my opposable thumbs could. I devised a contraption in the doorway that would be easy enough for a human to step over, but too hard for Sam to get through or over. With a wicked laugh I walked through the isles of Home Depot and found what I needed. Sam eyed me curiously - I let her watch - as I installed the end of her freedom: eleven bungee cords strung tight between rings drilled into the wood frame.\n\nI consider this one of my life's greatest achievements. I never have to worry again about my best little friend getting hit by a car. And I'm writing this article right now in a wonderful state of uninterrupted flow.\n\nThis really got me thinking - why do we put up endlessly with unsolved problems? Things that cause us a lot of pain and frustration? Especially as developers, we put up with a ton of problems of our own making. Dog-slow webpack builds. Terrible home-grown abstractions. CSS that produces Jira bug tickets faster than you can squash them. Rotten areas of the codebase that use three different JS frameworks because nobody dares touch that crap. These snags cost us every time they're tripped over. New features take exponentially longer to release. Existing features get no love for the\n\nthey need.\n\nBut instead of eliminating problems once and for all, we let them fester. We let them\n\nour productivity. We label them\n\nand\n\nto solve them, knowing full well that decision makers have no idea what we're talking about. Because getting shot down by management kinda feels like\n\n. It's a quick way to feel proactive without having to tackle the hard problems -  plus now we can blame someone else for our situation. Victim mode FTW!\n\nNo joke - I worked at a place once that\n\nthe phrase \"Technical Debt\". Developers weren't allowed to say it. Execs were tired of hearing about it and just wanted people to solve their own problems.\n\nWe sometimes do the same thing with our dev skills. Weak skills come with a steep tax. Skilled UI devs don't settle for struggling endlessly with CSS. They master it. They don't have to stop what they're doing and look up Flexbox or Grid all the time. The good news is a weak skill is just another problem to be solved. Mastering the fundamentals of your craft pays off huge in the long run. This is why I created\n\nand\n\n- so devs can solve their frontent layout problems once and for all. It's been awesome watching my students master this stuff and build amazing things on their own.\n\nEarly computer scientist\n\ncame up with a rule he called\n\n(ZOI). The idea is that for frequency of occurrence there are only three categories:\n\nThis zero, one, or many rule has had a huge impact in our industry. We see it in foreign keys in database design. It's been a fundamental in UX design ever since Alan Cooper's classic\n\n. It's also a fantastic rule for knowing when to solve problems - both in your life and in your code.\n\nDon't worry about it yet. Sometimes us devs get overwhelmed thinking we have to learn every bit of tech out there, when in reality most of it exists to solve problems we don't currently have. You can be an expert UI developer by only focusing on mastering the fundamentals and\n\n.\n\nMake a note, but don't sic your mind on coming up with a solution. Many problems are one-time events that won't bite you again. (dog references intended)\n\nAs soon as a problem gets encountered twice (twice by you, or twice by two different people in your team/family) then you're in\n\nterritory. If it can happen twice, it can happen a thousand times. This is the right time to solve it good and solve it once.\n\nWhen you set out to solve a problem, the biggest temptation is to do a\n\n. Something that mitigates the pain a little. You know you've fallen prey to this \"band-aid\" mindset if you hear yourself saying things like\n\nor\n\nor\n\n. Temporary fixes just aren't worth it. How many times have you encountered a\n\nin a project from someone who doesn't even work there anymore? Their temporary fix is now one more thing you have to understand to actually fix the core problem.\n\nHere's a better way to work:\n\n. Like, actually solve it. So that the problem has no chance of wasting another engineer's afternoon ever again. You can get all fancy if you want - keeping a spreadsheet of every occurrence of every problem. But it's easy enough to just say \"hey team, the wonky dropdown component took me four hours to debug, anyone else run into this?\" If so - it's fixin' time and you're up! If you delay the task to the dusty backlog you'll never get around to it. Solve it now while it's fresh on your mind. Solve it good so nobody has to trip over it or even think about it ever again.\n\nImagine how productive your life and project would be if problems were fixed as they came up, never allowed to impact more than twice?\n\nThink about an unsolved problem - your Sam - that you've been dealing with forever. Stop reading this right now and go take care of it.\n\nIn case you're wondering from the illustrations, Sam does indeed look more like a bat than a dog. Now that I've solved the escaping problem she's a happy, safe bat-dog.\n\nMaster CSS Grid right from the start by playing this new mastery\n    game.

Even in a warm office, even when wearing a hoodie. Cold hands makes writing code difficult - your fingers get stiff, typing slows down, and you have a constant distraction while you're trying to work.\n\nIn the spirit of\n\n, I set out to find a solution to this annoying problem.\n\nI tried the obvious solution first: gloves! After trying five pairs I came to the conclusion that you can't type (fast) with gloves, no matter what their marketing sites say. The fingerless kind were the closest, but then you still got ten cold digits.\n\nThese things are pretty much only good if they're inside of a glove or sock. Otherwise they're too weak and ineffective.\n\nI tried rechargeable electric warmers like this lulu bob thingy.\n\nAs well as a few other contraptions that had good reviews on Amazon. The problem with all of them is they only heat the small inside part of your hand, while the outside and your fingers still freeze. Also the heat it gives you doesn't last so as soon as you let go and start to type, the cold returns fast.\n\nI rigged up a heating pad like a hot pocket around my keyboard & mouse. But the blasted thing kept giving me small electrocutions. It also made my mouse too hard to use.\n\nThese work OK but it's hard to aim them in a way that gets your whole hands. Also the heat is pushed by air and it can make your hands feel even colder if you're not positioned close enough. Overall they're a hassle. I tripped a few breakers at Domo giving them a shot though :)\n\nI really like these\n\n. They keep their heat for a good while and release a bit of moisture which seems to helps the heat penetrate deeper. I used this for a long time but got tired of having to microwave it every hour and a half or so. I still use it for cold feet every now and then.\n\nOne day I was lobstering up in my hot tub (don't judge me, I've wanted a hot tub since I was a kid) thinking about the cold hands problem. I pondered how effective water is at heating the body. I did some research as to why that is. Here's a good\n\nif you're interested.\n\nThere are many factors but the main ones are:\n\nOk so a water-based solution is what I wanted. Maybe I could fill up some ziploc bags with hot water?\n\nI tried that and it kind of worked but was a bit sketch and very time consuming. I was also worried about damaging\n\n. Then I remembered the sous vide machine I saw at my Ma and Pa's house. It's a little device meant for cooking meals using hot water.\n\nI snagged\n\n, plugged it in under my desk, set it to 106 fahrenheit and gave my cold hands a plunge.\n\nI'd found it. I'd found\n\nsolution.\n\nThis thing works amazingly well. It's like a mini hot tub just for your hands! You can set it to your exact perfect temperature and it holds it there all day. I've dialed mine in to 110 fahrenheit and I love using it.\n\nA good rhythm I've found is to work one\n\nsession (30 minutes for me) then soak the hands for about a minute. My hands heat deeply \u2014 to the bone it feels like \u2014 and stay warm all through the next coding session.\n\nSome tips if you try this out:\n\nPeople who work remote will probably love this. I would have used it at my open office jobs too had I thought of it back then. But if it's too awkward for you just go with the corn bag approach, that's a close second.\n\nNow you know how to keep them money makers nice 'n toasty. Happy coding!\n\nFlexbox is incredibly powerful. But it's also crazy hard to master. So\n    we all end up depending on a cheat sheet and guessing in the dev\n    tools. Enough of that! Time to master it once and for all, in a way\n    that actually sticks, so you can build any layout you can imagine with\n    flexbox."}

We take any opportunity to get together for this battle of wits. There's nothing sweeter than that smug feeling of outsmarting your buddy with a cleverly-executed strategy.\n\nThe pandemic has made it hard to always get together. But my friend\n\nwas determined to not let a meager world-ending plague interfere with our shared passion! He put his incredible design skills to work and re-created The Duke in the popular design tool\n\n\u2014the same tool I used to create my\n\n. Figma is especially good for board gaming with its excellent multi-player functionality.\n\nHi I\u2019m Adam and I\u2019ll explain how I got started designing the Duke board game in Figma. The Duke is like Chess in a lot of ways. Two players face off on opposite sides of the board, trying to capture a key piece: the Duke.\n\nThe first questions I had to answer to make sure this game didn\u2019t feel like some shanty A piece of garbage were:\n\nThe answers to both ended up being a bit obvious but cool. I made two pages, one for each player. I then created a master Board component for each player. Then I put an instance of it on the opponent\u2019s page, rotated at 180\u00ba. I also locked that instance so that it showed up but was not interactive. With that setup White can take an action on their Board/page and the locked/rotated instance on Black\u2019s page will reflect that action.\n\nFor example here is what the White player sees:\n\nAnd here's the same game from the perspective of the Black player:\n\nThis mirroring trick makes it feel like your opponent is sitting right across from you!\n\nThe Duke is different from Chess in that you only start with three pieces. On your turn you can either move an existing piece, or draw a new piece randomly from your bag. Each piece has specific available movement options printed on the front. However, after you move you have to flip the moved piece revealing totally different movement mechanics. We needed a way to quickly switch between sides, as well as obscure the piece before it\u2019s drawn. Figma\u2019s\n\nwere perfect for the job. I created three variants for each piece:\n\n,\n\nand\n\n.\n\nNow to draw a new piece you simply selected a\n\npiece in your bag and switched it to the\n\nvariant. After moving a piece you toggled the\n\nor\n\nvariant.\n\nFrom here we got to playing! And it was honestly really quite good. I however am blessed to be a designer with three best friends who are killer developers (\n\n,\n\nand\n\n). So naturally as we played together in Figma they saw the potential to take things to the next level.\n\nI\u2019ll hand off to Dave to explain how he took the Duke to swanky town.\n\nThere were several things we had to do by hand that just felt dinky. Every time you moved or captured an opponent's piece you had to fiddle around with Figma pages and layers. Ewwww! Shuffling the bag manually was especially painful.\n\nWhile thinking about ways to improve the Figma board gaming experience, we remembered that Figma now supports custom\n\nincluding\n\n.\n\nYou can even write the UI for your plugin in modern HTML/CSS. This makes\n\neven\n\nuseful if you can believe it. Figma also comes with the\n\nso you can debug your scripts and inspect your layouts.\n\nIn between games you had to do these steps manually:\n\nWhy do things like this yourself when code can do it for you?!\n\nTo automate the setup I assigned each piece a unique\n\n\u2014similar to an HTML\n\n\u2014so the pieces could be found and controlled with the Figma\n\n. I tried querying the pieces by layer name at first, but it was\n\ntoo slow in a document like this with lots of layers.\n\nOnce your code has a reference to a piece you can move it wherever you want:\n\nOr control which variant to show:\n\nNow that I knew how to control the game pieces with code, writing a game setup script was a piece of cake. The game reset script makes pieces go back in the bag, the bag gets a proper\n\n, and everything's ready for the next game!\n\nThe Duke is all about moving your pieces around and capturing your opponent's. These were manual processes with several steps. So I made a\n\n, which generates a new red Figma layer over each enemy piece. Then you can select which piece you want to capture, and the plugin code takes care of it!\n\nBoard gaming is the best and has really helped get me through this rough pandemic. I'll share this Figma document and plugin as soon as I get permission from The Duke publisher.\n\nFigma is an\n\ndesign and collaboration tool\u2014perfect for playing remotely with friends or prototyping your own board games.\n\nKnowing how to code is a superpower. It feels like wielding powerful magic, and breathes life into all your other hobbies and passions.

He was right, and what he said has stuck with me to this day.\n\nThe tools you use help you create more and better things than you could have on your own. Your tools empower you. They deserve your fierce loyalty... right up until the second you find something\n\n!\n\nIn that spirit, here's my update to date list of favorite tools for:\n\nis my latest favorite suite of tools. It's got great mindmaps, sticky notes (kanban board on steroids), flowcharts and wireframes. It's one of only four tabs I keep pinned in my browser because I use it so frequently.

The ability to create a\n\nof cards anywhere is powerful.\n\ngets out of the way and is a perfect fit for creative thinking.\n\nHere's a\n\nflowchart I made in Whimsical when thinking through one of the boss fight levels in my\n\ngame.\n\nLife's too short to arrange your own windows.

Moom also has some smart external monitor support \u2014 you can tell it to arrange your windows in a certain way when you plug/unplug your monitor(s).\n\nI was a long-time\n\nuser but have recently found myself using\n\nin its place.

But I can't even count how many times a day I need to take measurements or check alignments. The browser dev tools have some\n\ntools around this, but I've fallen completely in love with\n\n. It lets me take multiple measurements quickly, leave them there if I wish, change some code and refresh the page, and see if my the resulting measurements are correct. It's completely awesome.

Snagit lets you mark up your screenshots with text/arrows, edit/crop, and somehow even adjust the position of things in the screenshot, which feels like black magic.\n\nkeeps track of all your screenshots too. Here's what it looks like as I work on this post:\n\nI'm comfortable with Git on the command line, but sometimes a nice GUI makes for a much better workflow. My editor (VSCode) has a built-in Git GUI but it doesn't come close to\n\nthat I've used and loved for years. I've prevented checking in many a\n\nthanks to the visual commit preview. It makes working with branches fast and easy, and the search feature is quite good.\n\nI've also recently added the\n\nto my workflow as it's the best thing there is currently for working with pull requests locally. Tower has\n\npull request functionality but it's not caught up yet to Github CLI.\n\nI used to panic when I'd see merge conflicts. If you've ever left a branch alive too long you know the feeling. I'm starting to think perhaps that feeling of panic is just a sign that I don't have the right tool yet. Since discovering and getting familiar with\n\nthere's no diff that can scare me. I especially love their three-way diff, that shows the two changesets on the sides and the (editable) merge results in the middle. It lets you go through each change one at a time and decide what to do with it. You can configure Tower to use Kaleidoscope as your diff tool so whenever Tower detects a conflict, it will open the file for you in Kaleidoscope for you to resolve.\n\nAs I work, my open browser tabs seem to multiply like\n\n. I used to get completely overwhelmed by the sheer number of them until I discovered\n\n. It's a powerful Chrome extension (Firefox and Edge coming soon I hear) that lets you organize your tabs into\n\n. Each workspace has its own set of tabs that you need. When I'm writing an article like I am now, I switch to my\n\nworkspace. Workona closes everything but the four tabs I need. If I get a bug report for\n\nI'll switch to my\n\nworkspace and I'm ready to go.\n\nis perfect and I can't believe it's free. If they ever launch a pro plan I'll be the first to sub.\n\nHere's what it looks like in my Blog workspace:\n\nMy first design tool love was Fireworks (RIP). When that died I tried to switch to Illustrator but it never felt great. Then Sketch came along and was my go to for a lot of years. Most recently\n\nwas released and after making my new logo in it I was hooked. The navigation (zoom/pan/etc) alone is flawless and has ruined other apps like Photoshop for me. It's very fast even when there are a ton of assets on a page. It's a paragon of the possibilities of\n\n.\n\nNo code editor beats\n\nthese days. The app is fast, the plugin/theme ecosystem is strong, and it's highly customizable. For example I recently made its terminal panes\n\nand it was a piece of cake. I love that whenever there's a tiny bit of friction in my workflow, I can often eliminate it through customization.\n\nis the gift that keeps on giving.\n\nMy favorite theme as of late is\n\nwith the clean\n\nfont. So much purple! Gosh dang I love purple. It doesn't get much prettier than this.\n\nYou see this styled blog but as I write I get to look at this beauty:\n\nThe browser devtools have really good color pickers these days, but they only work in the browser. So my color picker is the one in\n\n. I like that it stores the colors I've picked recently to save me some work. And I like that I can easily switch from hex to rgb. I don't really use all the rest of xScope's tools though, so I am on the lookout for a better/cheaper standalone color picker. If you love yours please let me know!\n\nSetting up a new computer is a pain, but I've automated most of it using\n\n. In a single\n\nI list all the tools & apps (even App Store ones!), and fonts that I use. Running\n\nsets up a brand new computer in minutes. It just takes a bit of discipline as you go to add things to your\n\ninstead of manually installing them with\n\n. But if you're a lazy sack you can just run the\n\ncommand to create a new\n\nthat lists everything you have currently installed. But I prefer to keep my setup clean and intentional. Here's my current\n\nin case you're curious what else I use.\n\nI use\n\nfor custom keyboard shortcuts for my\n\n. There's a similar program for Windows called\n\nthat I may or may not have used to cheat in Starcraft2 as a kid.\n\nWindows has an easy way of uninstalling most things, but for some reason macOS doesn't. So I use\n\nwhen I want to get rid of an app and all its files. We don't need that junk lying around now, do we!\n\nThis one is more of a hobby tool for me, but\n\nblows my mind. I use mainly for designing and 3D printing things around the house, as well as custom board game accessories cause I'm a nerd like that. I've written before about how our industry could\n\nfrom Fusion's advanced editing/timeline tools.\n\nHere are the\n\nI designed for my favorite card game\n\n.\n\nI've used\n\nsince my very first Mac and it's been great.

You probably know the feeling well - you're trying your hardest to figure something out, but solid ideas just aren't coming. You take a shot at one\n\nsolution after another as the frustration rises.\n\n.\n\nSomething they never tell you is that even the most experienced professionals get stumped on a regular basis. In fact I think \"what are you currently stuck on?\" would make a fantastic interview question. So when you get stuck, don't get discouraged. Instead see it as a sign that you're challenging yourself and progressing in your skills. But what should you do in the moment when you're stuck?\n\n?\n\nYou know the song\n\nby Simon and Garfunkel? Paul Simon had this catchy tune his in mind but was having a rough time coming up with lyrics for it. He was stuck. I can imagine him in a striped shirt and leather jacket, plucking notes on his guitar, experimenting with a bunch of\n\nphrases. Eventually something\n\nand he used this lack of inspiration as the inspiration itself. He wrote\n\nto lament about that feeling of helplessness when your source of inspiration is fleeting. His lyrics make a lot of sense when you realize who Cecilia is - the\n\naccording to the Catholic tradition.\n\nCecilia, you're breaking my heart\n\nYou're shaking my confidence daily\n\nOh Cecilia, I'm down on my knees\n\nI'm begging you please to come home\n\nSt Cecilia, by painter Nicolas Poussin\n\nPaul got unstuck by writing about the problem he was facing. If a celebrated songwriter who composed around\n\ncan get stuck, so can you and I.\n\nThe other day I was trying to solve what I felt like should have been a fairly easy problem. I wanted to create a sweet laptop sticker layout using hexagons and characters from my UI Mastery Games\n\nand\n\n.\n\nI started sketching some ideas on my iPad and was feeling pretty good about it.\n\nI wanted to give the main characters like Meg some bigger stickers, yet still have all the hex shapes fit together nicely. One idea I tried was lengthening Meg's hexagon shape like this:\n\nBut that left an awkward little gap near the bottom. An idea to fix that would be to make the tall shape even taller:\n\nBut this still had a problem where you wouldn't be able to place any stickers underneath the tall one and have them fit all perfectly together.\n\nI played around with about a dozen increasingly crappy ideas before realizing I was frustrated and stuck. I put my mac to sleep, rubbed my eyes, and decided to try something different.\n\nThe first thing I did is write down as concisely as possible the problem I was trying to solve. I wrote \"make an awesome layout for my laptop stickers, that fans will be proud to show off\". Just writing it down seemed to relieve some stress and give me clarity.\n\nAfter that I asked myself \"what constraints am I operating under right now?\". I wrote them down:\n\nI was going to keep working at it, but we had a family outing planned that I didn't want to miss. So I closed my laptop and took my wife and kids to enjoy the fall festivities at Cornbelly's. While launching my kids on the zip lines and devouring terrible fair food I didn't think about my layout problem once. But when we passed by this shoe cubby I couldn't help but stop and stare:\n\nAnd just like that, something clicked. My mind drew lines around these hexagon shapes in a way that would be absolutely perfect for my layout:\n\nBecause I had clarified what I was trying to solve, I had defined\n\nfor my brain to chew on in the background. Because I had\n\n, I was free to discard many of them. I didn't\n\nto lengthen a hexagon to make a bigger sticker: I could just use two vertically. Or three in an L-shape. And they'll always fit together perfectly. I didn't have to use pointy tips up, that's just the way I'm used to seeing them on most people's laptops. Thanks to this strike of inspiration I'm no longer stuck on the project and am excited to show you the final result when they're done.\n\nI didn't realize it at the time, but this is the same way I got unstuck the time I had a crazy webgl perf issue\n\nFlexbox Zombies. Having learned from these and other experiences I'm now able to extract a formula:\n\nIf you do this there's a good chance you'll randomly think of something when you least expect it. It also helps to talk through the problem with a friend, get their take on things. Just remember that inspiration takes time to strike and you can't rush it. But if in a day or two if you still haven't solved it, come back to the problem fresh and try again. It's important to\n\n- that's what gives your mind more raw input materials to work with. You may hit another wall or three and that's totally fine. Just repeat these steps as many times as it takes.

I was an OK player, hovering in gold or silver league.\n\nIf you're played the game you'll be familiar with the alien Zerg race.\n\nI loved playing Zerg, but to keep up with your opponent you have to remember to quickly \"spawn larvae\" with your queens on all your bases every 28 seconds.\n\nOne day I got tired of this annoying, repetitive task and decided to automate it.\n\nI wrote a little macro that would do the whole task automatically and instantly, every 28 seconds.\n\nThanks to my macro I was able to focus my attention on the fun gameplay mechanics. Within a week I had advanced to Diamond league.\n\nNote: I don't recommend this in games because it's pretty much cheating and I felt bad about it so I stopped using my macro before Blizzard banned me :)\n\nBut when it comes to coding, this kind of productive cheating is encouraged!\n\nMost editors support\n\n- a convenient way to write new lines of code.\n\nMacros on the other hand are fantastic for automating all the repetitive actions you perform on the code you've already written.\n\nYou probably don't even realize how frequently you do the same sequences.\n\nThe first step to leveling up your coding with macros is to identify the right sequences.\n\nLook for sequences that:\n\nFor example here's something I noticed I do all the time. I have a line of code (constructor, function call, etc) that I want to adjust.\n\nBut I still want to keep the original line around until I'm happy with my change. So I copy the line down, move cursor up, comment out the original line, and move the cursor to the new line to edit.\n\nNow I can adjust the new line until I'm happy with what it does, and delete the old line.\n\nThis little sequence takes 4 actions. So I wrote a macro to do it with a single keystroke.\n\nAt first it takes some deliberate practice, coding while also paying attention to the meta game: looking for sequences you didn't even realize you depend on daily.\n\nKeep a piece of paper next to your keyboard. Every time you use a sequence of actions, name it something that briefly describes it, and write it down on the paper. Also write down the number of actions it takes.\n\nEvery time you use it, put a tally mark next to it. You'll soon have a very clear picture of things you can automate. For example:\n\nThe more you use a sequence and the more keystrokes a macro would save you the better.\n\nBefore writing a macro, check first to see if your editor already has a command that does what you need. If not, write your own!\n\nMany editors like vim, Sublime Text, Webstorm etc have built in support for macros.\n\nI've been using VS Code lately and am liking it.\n\nIt doesn't have macro support though so I wrote\n\n- cleverly named \"macros\" - that makes writing macros super easy.\n\nWhichever editor you use, start finding the repetitive, tedious parts if your coding life and code that junk away with macros!"}

Giving everyone root would permit anyone in the organisation to fix their own problems, deploy their own software, or, less charitably, cowboy things or be downright naughty. And while everyone had root, it usually turned out that only the operations team had the on call pager.\n\nAfter the wholesale failure of organisations to\n\n, I\u2019m a big fan of the\n\nmovement. So when George Barnett and I built the\n\nwe made a deliberate decision that everyone would get the same tools, and (modulo permissions and audit logs) be empowered to use the platform to the full extent. There wouldn\u2019t be one set of tools for regular users, and a super set of \u201cpower tools\u201d reserved for operators.\n\nTo me\n\n, means if you have a problem, we\u2019ll help you learn to use the tools better, not fix your problem for you.\n\nI remember playing with VMware in 1999 or early 2000. I thought it was an amazing trick, especially as the drivers for my sound card worked way better in virtualized Windows than the real thing.\n\nFast forward a few years and I was using VMware to maintain a fleet of foreign language Windows installations for testing. Skip forward a few more and the industry had figured out that virtualisation was a solution to the sprawl of single use Windows servers that cluttered up wiring cupboards and data centres.\n\nVirtualisation is a neat trick taken well beyond the point of a joke, but it did shine a light on the dark corners of systems administration. Back when turning up a server involved purchase orders, waiting for hardware to be shipped, contract negotiations, and trips to the data centre, what was a few hours spent installing the operating system? But when virtual hardware could be conjured out of thin air in seconds, it cast a long shadow over the need to automate operating system installation and management.\n\nThis was the age of Puppet and Chef, who re-plowed the ground sowed a decade earlier by CFEngine. Now sysadmins could configure and manage servers at the speed they could be virtually provisioned. I remember, thinking back to when I started to use Puppet, and imagining about what it would have been like to have those tools in previous jobs, where automation involved SVN repositories full of perl scripts, and crontab entries lovingly copy pasta\u2019d between machines. And so everything was good for a time in the age of configuration as code.\n\nBut, simulating the entirety of an x86 host on another, just so people can share a computer, is a ridiculous waste. This shouldn\u2019t be a surprise, FreeBSD Jails and Solaris Zones (rest in peace) had been coughing loudly about this for decades. Bryan Cantrill said it best when he exclaimed that we should \u201c\n\n\u201c, or as we\u2019ve come to know them: containers.\n\nI remember where I saw Docker for the first time. The product wasn\u2019t even a year old and Docker were carpet bombing any meetup that would have them to promote it. Canonical were sprinting at a hotel near SFO and I convinced several of my teammates to squeeze into a taxi for the first meetup in San Mateo. What I saw that night shook me to my core. It wasn\u2019t just the speed\u2013oh the speed, after spending two years waiting for EC2 and slow apt mirrors\u2013it was the clarity of that Californian mindset:\n\nIt was clear to me that night that virtual machines were virtualising stuff that people didn\u2019t care about; virtual video cards, virtual floppy drives, virtual ram that swapped to virtual disks. What people wanted was a virtual kernel\u2013their own pid 1. Orchestration tools like Chef, Puppet,\n\nwere trying to orchestrate an entire operating system when what developers really wanted was a way to take a single program, the one that they had written, and deploy it to a server. Filesystems, crontabs,\n\n/\n\n/\n\n,\n\nand\n\n, weren\u2019t just someone else\u2019s problem, they were irrelevant.\n\nAnyone who\u2019s endured to my rants about product knows my unwavering belief in the\n\n. Through the window of Christensen\u2019s logic, it was clear that the server orchestration market had been upended in that moment. Squeezed between Docker images at the low end and Netflix\u2019s \u201ceverything is an AMI\u201d model at the top end, was a large middle ground filled with orchestration tools that expected to be given a\n\noperating system to configure. The Chefs and Puppets and whatnots would be desperately trying to convince the biggest orchestration users\u2013the Netflixes of the world, with their CI/CD pipelines that pooped AMIs\u2013to adopt agent based tooling, while all the while each developer faced with the question \u201cHow should I deploy my application?\u201d would default to\n\n.\n\nIf you\u2019re building your own orchestration layer, then you are betting on the wrong horse\u2013I say this as someone who\u2019s built a\n\n.\n\nWithin the next year or two you\u2019ll be able to buy access to a Kubernetes API server at every price point; on your laptop, shared as a VPS, in your own VPC, or even as an appliance. Building on top of the Kubernetes primitives is where the value lies. Building on top of the shared tooling the Kubernetes API provides the level playing field that every development team who is responsible for supporting their own software in production is entitled to.\n\nWhy did I join\n\n? Because I believe that the administration of operating systems has reached its endgame. Kubernetes is going to revolutionise the way software is developed, and deployed, and I\u2019m honoured to be given the opportunity to join the company that is going to make that happen."}

In every instance I have met experienced, passionate, pragmatic programmers ready to accept Go for what it can do for them.\n\nAt the same time the message from each of these communities was the same; where is the documentation, where are the examples, where are the tutorials\u00a0? Travelling to these communities has been an humbling experience and has made me realise my privileged position as a native English speaker.\n\nThe documentation, and the tutorials, and the examples will come, slowly; this is open source after all.

I ended up writing way more than they asked for.\n\nIf you are a Nerd like me,\u00a0I hope you find some of this advice helpful.\n\nOf course you should do your research before talking about something, but also (re)read writing that you enjoyed as inspiration, analyse its style, analyse what qualities you enjoyed unrelated to its topic.\n\nRe-watch presentations that you enjoyed, you are going to be doing a presentation after all, analyse the style of the presentation, the manner of the speaker, the way they presented their argument, the way they present themselves on stage.\n\nIn this respect, imitation is the most sincere form of flattery.\n\nDon\u2019t write in the passive voice, ever. If you don\u2019t know what I mean, read\n\n.\n\nThe TL;DR of the passive voice is sounding like a CEO or a politician. Always use the first person or second person pronouns, I and You, to assign ownership of an idea or responsibility to someone, don\u2019t leave it hanging out there with phrases like \u201cwe should\u201d.\n\nIn order of importance you need\n\nThe conclusion is your position, your idea, your argument, your call to action, summarised in one slide.\n\nDon\u2019t start writing until you know how your talk ends.\n\nThe introduction should set the stage for the conclusion.\n\nThe rest of the talking points should flow logically from the proposition established in the introduction. They should be relevant and supportive of the conclusion. If a point does not relate to the introduction, or support the conclusion then either rewrite it, drop it, or in extreme cases reconsider your conclusion.\n\nEvery presentation will have a minimum and maximum time limit; if you don\u2019t know it, ask the organiser, don\u2019t guess. All things being equal it is preferable to finish sooner than to run overtime. Here are some of the techniques I use for planning my talk.\n\nThe two key elements are word count and the number of slides.\n\nI prefer to write my talks in full as a paper, you may choose to speak to bullet points, it\u2019s very much personal choice. Either way you have a set number of words to work with for your presentation.\n\nThe average speaking pace for native English speakers is around 120 to 130 words per minute. You can use this to calculate the number of words a presentation will require.\n\nProfessional speakers will talk slower, around 100 words per minute. Don\u2019t assume that you will be able to to do this unless you have had a lot of practice at public speaking. Plan for a higher word rate and write accordingly. It will be easier to speed up during your talk if you are short on time, than to make yourself slow down if you are panicking.\n\nA good rule of thumb is 2,000 to 2,500 words for a 20 minute presentation, 4,000 to 5,000 for a 45 minute slot.\n\nAim to finish ahead of time so people can prove they were listening by asking questions.\n\nI budget on one supporting slide per minute. So 18 to 20 slides for a 20 minute presentation, 35 to 40 for a 45 minute presentation.\n\nI\u2019ve found this to be a pretty reliable rule of thumb regardless of the style of presentation or how I have prepared for it.\n\nYou may want to structure your slides with one bullet point per slide rather than one topic, but don\u2019t think \u201cthis will take less time\u201d. It might be true, but it risks any small delay in covering a slide multiplying through your deck and blowing your time limit.\n\nIf you are running short on time it is easier to summarize slides with multiple points on tham to catch up without looking like you\u2019re rushing.\n\nRead through your talk multiple times to check your material and time yourself \u2013 this is why I prefer to write my talks in full, it helps avoid the temptation to skip the rehearsal of parts that I\n\nI know well.\n\nWith all respect to conference organisers, the presentation stage is the most hostile environment you will encounter. Every effort is made by the organisers to mitigate this, but the bottom line is, if things go to shit, you still have to do your talk, so plan for things to fail.\n\nIf your talk is formatted for wide screen, assume the projector is from the stone age and you\u2019ll have to use someone else\u2019s 4:3 laptop. If there is an opportunity to practice in the space, take it.\n\nAssume the internet won\u2019t work. Yup, it\u2019s 2015 and internet is everywhere, except on stage. This is super important if you use tools like Google present or anything that uses web fonts.\n\nAlso assume that multi monitor set ups just won\u2019t work, so all that clever shit that keynote does is useless, have a fall back.\n\nLarger conferences will either request, or demand that you use their laptops, even to the point of asking for presentation material well in advance. The lowest common denominator here is PDF, so whatever tool you use, make sure it can emit a PDF.\n\nBecause of these difficulties, if you plan to use speaking notes, you should have a way to access those independent of your presentation software. I\u2019ve found copying the text into a Google doc works well and lets me edit my speech after the presentation materials have been handed over to the organisers.\n\nBeware that Goggle docs is really pedantic about being online, so don\u2019t assume that just because the document was open on your laptop before lunch, it\u2019ll work on stage. If in doubt export your notes to a PDF.\n\nEstablishing contact with the audience is one of the hardest things for me. There are many aspects of this\n\nDuh, who doesn\u2019t say that ? The fact is you will be nervous, or if not nervous, excited, so you will talk faster than you plan to.\n\nThe key is to take time for yourself.\n\nIf you\u2019re reading from a script, then start a new paragraph between points and remind yourself to take a deep breath.\n\nIt gives the audience time to read the material on the slide before you start to speak. This is important because while you know it backwards and forwards, this is probably the first time the audience is getting a chance to see your idea.\n\nIf you feel uncomfortable then fill that time by taking a drink of water or walking to a different part of the stage. The latter is my favourite because it gives you excuse to take another pause to walk back.\n\nYour throat will get dry during your talk, this is part of our fight or flight response to stressful situations; it\u2019s the adrenaline. If it happens, don\u2019t let it throw you, focus on pausing between points. Take a drink of water to insert a pause into your presentation, but don\u2019t panic if taking a drink doesn\u2019t fix the problem, that\u2019ll just make it worse.\n\nLastly, don\u2019t beat yourself up afterwards.\n\nPublic speaking is a skill that needs practice, it\u2019s not something that any of us are born with. This is why they make us practice public speaking in high school. But it\u2019s probably been a long time since you and I were in high school, and we probably didn\u2019t realise the importance of what we were being taught at the time.\n\nSo, don\u2019t expect to be awesome every time, and don\u2019t put yourself in a position where your talk must be awesome. This isn\u2019t an interview, it\u2019s not a binary thing, even if you were nervous, or talked too fast, or realised that you crapped up one point in your argument, it\u2019s still ok, the audience will still get a lot from it.\n\nThis is\u00a0a short post to recognise the incredible contribution Alex Brainman has made to the Go project.\n\nAlex was responsible for the port of Go to Windows way back before Go 1 was even released. Since that time he has virtually single-handedly supported Go and Go users on Windows. It\u2019s no wonder that he is the 10th most active contributor to the project.\n\nThe Windows build is consistently\n\nmost popular download from the official go site.\n\nWhile I may not use Windows, and you may not use Windows, spare a thought for the large body of developers who\n\nuse Windows to develop Go programs and are able to do so because of Alex\u2019s efforts.\n\nEven if your entire business doesn\u2019t use Windows, consider the moment when your product manager comes to you and asks \u201cso, we\u2019ve got a request from a big customer to port our product to Windows, that\u2019s not going to be hard, right ?\u201d. Your answer is directly attributable to Alex\u2019s contributions.\n\nAlex, every Go programmer owes you a huge debt of gratitude. So let me be the first to say it, thank you for everything you have done for Go. None of us would be as successful as we are today without your work."}

Here's my all-time favorite gear so far \u2014 I hope you enjoy!\n\nNote: I was able to line up affiliate links for a handful of these, so if you buy using my links I may earn a bit o' cash that I'll put towards more free games like\n\n. You don't pay any extra and in some cases even get a discount.\n\nI'll keep this list up to date as new/better things come along!\n\nI'm a big fan of having a dual, vertical monitor setup. You get tons of screen real estate without having to crane your neck side to side. I searched far and wide for a heavy duty monitor arm that could support the weight of two big monitors. The\n\nis a dream come true. I've had it for over two years now and it hasn't failed me once. Having both monitors attached to a single arm means you can move the entire thing forward/back/up/down as you please. It's fantastic.\n\nI like putting code on the bottom monitor, browser on the top monitor. Here's the desk where the magic happens:\n\nI got some\n\nrecently and stuck them to the back edge of my desk. It has completely transformed and upgraded my office space. I can set the colors to whatever vibrant mood I'm in. Or a nice bright white for working. It's hard to describe the effect, but it just makes my working environment feel welcoming and ready for me to be productive in.\n\nis an incredible, split mechanical keyboard. I've had about a dozen different keyboards for coding and this one's my favorite. It's the only keyboard (that I know of) that lets you swap out the key switches. I started with Cherry Blues switches but found the clicky click a bit too distracting. Switched out to the softer Gateron Brown switches and they're just right.\n\nYou can control its LED atmosphere lights and customize all the keys with their\n\n. Here's my current setup with the (optional) blank keycaps:\n\nThe\n\nis an excellent mouse. I've had the previous two versions of this mouse as well, and each model upgrade has added a little bit of polish. The mouse is ergonomic, comfortable, tracks well on my slick bamboo desk surface, has decently big side buttons for back/forward, and an overall quality/industrial feel.\n\nAfter a ton of research and a few returns, I went with the\n\nbackpack. They're a small company not far from where I live here in the valley, and they make a really good bag. I've used mine heavily for over a year and the rugged thing is still good as new. It's made from a water-resistent canvas-like material that reminds me of camping as a kid. It has tons of pockets for all my stuff: laptop, iPad, chargers, headphones, notebook etc. You can get all sorts of accessories for it like a camera/drone insert. It's comfy on the ol' back, and is compact enough to be good for taking my rig on flights and to conferences.\n\nAnother local company makes this minimalist\n\nand it's perfect. Super slim, fits just a handful of things but that's all I need. I got one for my dad to see if I could get him to switch away from his ultra thick 80's style leather wallet, but no luck.\n\nI've been tryout out\n\n. I like the idea of evolving my own custom system for staying on top of everything. I'm just using the\n\nand it's quality.\n\nI'm a big fan of these ultra thin (0.38)\n\npens. They let you create small, neat writings which is perfect for journaling and\n\n. They dry fast, don't bleed through the page, and are waterproof once dry.\n\nI also like these fine tip (0.05)\n\n, but they don't seem to last very long.\n\nSince I build (education) games for a living, I figure it's important to play plenty of other games for\n\npurposes ;) I wanted a better gaming monitor that wasn't crazy expensive, and ultimately picked the\n\n. The high 144hz refresh rate makes a huge difference for games \u2014\u00a0everything is super smooth. Having g-sync is a nice, I no longer get screen tearing when I play Overwatch. This monitor is a VA panel instead of the more common IPS panel, so blacks are\n\n. Which is exactly what you want if you play games with lots of shadows (e.g.\n\n) or space (e.g.\n\n) like I do. This monitor doesn't have some of the newer tech like HDR or 4k, but you really don't need those for games yet. Like all tech, 4k and HDR are crazy expensive when new but will come down in price in a couple years.\n\nSpace games, and this monitor, are Pippin approved.\n\nI'm always trying new things and will keep this list up to date as I find more awesome gear. If you've got something you love that you think I'd enjoy please let me know!\n\nFlexbox is incredibly powerful. But it's also crazy hard to master. So\n    we all end up depending on a cheat sheet and guessing in the dev\n    tools. Enough of that! Time to master it once and for all, in a way\n    that actually sticks, so you can build any layout you can imagine with\n    flexbox."}
{"url": "https://mastery.games/post/practice-css/", "origin": "https://gedd.ski/", "title": "Practice CSS Like an Artist", "content": "As a kid I became interested in oil painting. My dad is a professional artist and I wanted to be like him. One day I asked if he would teach me. The invaluable lesson he gave me shaped how I learned to code and how I became good at CSS.\n\nOur house was like one big art gallery \u2014 paintings, pottery & sculptures everywhere. Dad walked me over to the nearest Arlo Coles painting on the wall, and said \"\n\n\":\n\nI asked. \"\n\n\" he replied. When pressed for more help, he said \"\n\n\"\n\nI did my best to copy this awesome painting. The result wasn't very good, but I learned a lot. He had me try again and again. Here's one attempt that I actually kept:\n\nTrying to recreate great work is one of the most effective ways to improve any skill\u2014 not just art. I used this same exercise to learn web development. I'd find a website that I thought looked slick, and I'd try to recreate it myself.\n\nSometimes I'd have to cheat and peek under the hood with the devtools. I'd see things in the code that made zero sense, and I'd have to go study them. I learned\n\nmuch doing this. It was way more effective than any of my University assignments. If you're at all like me, you\n\n.\n\nObviously it's not cool to rip off someone else's work and pass it off as your own, so only use this as a learning exercise.\n\nTo this day I still use this exercise to continue refining my skills. I'm often inspired by the UIs in video games. The designs and interactions are exciting. Recreating them really stretches your coding skills. Plus it means you\n\nto play games... for research ;)\n\nHere you can watch me build the\n\nand the\n\n.\n\nFrom a lifetime of teaching students, my dad knew to help me avoid the biggest pitfall: getting caught up in the details too soon. His\n\nadvice was incredibly helpful. But he didn't come up with the idea. Great artists have been using this principle for centuries.\n\nA classic example can be seen in\n\n's famous\n\n.\n\nWith a few bold, sweeping strokes he defines the composition of each piece. He probably\n\nto work fast as he preferred to draw the lions while they fed. Delacroix was masterful at capturing the overall essence, leaving the fine details for later.\n\nSo how do we apply this broad strokes principle to practicing CSS?\n\nCSS has a ton of properties, but you could group them into just two categories:\n\nor\n\n.\n\nThe primary broad stroke tools are Grid, Flexbox, and Position. All the rest are fine details: hover interactions, animations, padding, borders, clip-path etc.\n\nTo use broad strokes, you build the site\n\n. You focus first on the overall composition. CSS Grid is\n\ngood for this, as it lets you define an entire\n\nin a\n\n.\n\nIn the book\n\n, Bert Dodson clarifies the broad strokes principle. He's talking about pencil strokes but might as well be talking about divs:\n\nRule #1. Draw the large shapes first, then the smaller shapes... it's easier to work from the general to the specific than the other way around. Start with the largest shape you see. Forget everything else and draw that shape... Now you have something you can build on, restate, compare with surrounding shapes, subdivide into smaller shapes, etc.\n\nDodson also teaches a nifty little trick: you\n\nand look at your subject. By squinting you can no longer see a lot of the small details, but just the big broad shapes. Try it next time you go to build a layout!\n\nI encourage every dev to master these broad strokes tools of layout. I've made this as easy and fun as possible with my\n\nand\n\nmastery games. Once you have those broad stroke tools down, practice CSS by recreating the awesome work you admire. You'll\n\nat CSS before you know it!\n\nMaster CSS Grid right from the start by playing this new mastery\n    game. You'll learn the ins and outs of Grids one fun level at a time,\n    while saving an adorable alien life form from certain destruction."}
{"url": "https://mastery.games/post/deliberate-practice/", "origin": "https://gedd.ski/", "title": "Mastery through Deliberate Practice", "content": "A new student of mine recently shared his code-learning journey so far: he had watched countless videos on web development. But whenever he'd go to actually build something himself he couldn't remember how most of it worked. The smallest snag and he was stumped. He constantly felt frustrated and discouraged that all his time and effort spent wasn't translating into to actual skills. He wondered if he was even cut out for this. He was\n\n.\n\nWhenever I crack open a new board game I've never played before, I like to watch a video of someone experienced with the game explaining its concepts and rules. I read through the manual, setup the board, and try it out myself. Without fail, I get stuck and have to google for answers to my many questions:\n\nIf it's a complex (and amazing) game like\n\nthen it's going to take dozens of game nights before everything really clicks. Watching more tutorials isn't going to help at this point\u2014 you've just gotta play the game.\n\nLearning to code is the same way. The concepts are abstract and the rules are complex. New tech (like expansion packs) are constantly released. You don't need one more tutorial\u2014 you've just gotta play the game. Use the tech yourself. Build something (a lot of things) with it. This is the\n\nyou'll master it. It's the\n\nyou're ever going to get to the point where you can just sit down and work, without having to constantly stop and reference the rulebook. And that's when the\n\nfun begins.\n\nBefore you can learn anything you must first\n\n. Then once you begin to learn something, you start by loading information into your short-term memory. This is where reading blog posts, following tutorials etc is helpful. But don't stop there. And especially don't move on to something else too soon. Trying to cram a whole new topic into your overburdened prefrontal cortex isn't very effective. Your short-term storage centers only have so much capacity. Like a computer's RAM, if it runs out of space then new data will overwrite previous data.\n\nBefore moving on it's important to convert that fresh information into something more stable and long-term. For this you have two options: declarative memory and procedural memory.\n\nWhen you intentionally memorize information, your brain transfers that data via the hippocampus to the temporal cortex for safekeeping. This is an\n\n,\n\nmemory\u2014 you intentionally allocated space for it. Examples of this process would be memorizing CSS properties, or taking notes about JavaScript Array methods.\n\nTo be useful to you later, this type of memory has to be re-loaded back into working (short-term) memory. Similar to loading data from a computer hard drive back into RAM. This process is relatively slow and takes effort.\n\nThere is a much better long-term option for skills like coding: the cerebellum (and friends). Unlike memorization,\n\nmemories arrive here\n\n\u2014 on their own, often unintentionally. The process happens automatically simply by\n\nsomething. Procedural memory is formed every time you set a CSS property and watch the results. Every time you write a function implementation and check the result it returns.\n\nEvery time you write (or edit) code, you create (or strengthen) procedural memories.\n\nRecall of procedural memory is instant, unconscious, and effortless. Right now you are reading this post without having to remember how to read. Later you'll write an email or slack message without having to remember how to type. At this level the skill becomes natural, effortless. And it's completely possible to get there with coding skills.\n\nProcedural memory is also sometimes called\n\n, because when it was first discovered it was initially believed to only apply to motor skills (e.g. driving a car, playing the piano). But studies of people with amnesia (who are unable to form declarative memory) has broadened our understanding.\n\nProcedural memory is the superior long-term storage option, and creating it in students for coding skills is the primary goal of\n\n.\n\nThink of the last time you sat down to code something up. Was it effortless? Or did you have to work to remember how? Or did you have to work to remember where you might have seen the answer before as you go look it up? This simple exercise will reveal to you which long-term memory drive your coding skills are\n\nresiding in.\n\nBut don't get down on yourself if you realize you're mostly using declarative memory! We are all that way, in a lot of areas! The takeaway though is that you don't have to settle for that for your coding skills. You can have it better. You can transform yourself into a beast of a procedural memory machine.\n\nHow do we go about transitioning to this ideal type of memory?\n\nDoing something on repeat will form procedural memories. But mindless repetition isn't the most effective strategy. Deliberate practice is the key. With deliberate practice you pick a\n\nthing you'd like to improve, and you do it. Over and over, making sure you have good feedback to know whether you're doing it correctly.\n\nIn\n\nstudents spend an entire learning session on a single CSS Grid property like\n\n. They learn the ins and outs of the property, then solve challenge after challenge using it as the key component of the layout.\n\nMost courses and tutorials don't include the deliberate practice component, but you can set it up for yourself. It's not too complicated:\n\nDo this consistently and before you know it you'll notice yourself gaining the\n\n.\n\nSay you want to learn\n\n. Start with blog posts, videos or the great resources on\n\nand\n\n. Great! Your short-term memory is loaded up. Now go build a lot of things with what you just learned. Find layouts you think look nice and see if you can recreate them yourself. Direct that fresh information straight into your procedural memory centers. The more times you do it, the better.\n\nIn my\n\nI shared the story of how I used deliberate practice to get better at StarCraft2. You can use deliberate practice to get quite good at literally anything.\n\nThe student I told you about at the beginning of this post wrote me back a few weeks later, after using the deliberate practice I provide in my Mastery Games. He was ecstatic to tell me that\n\nand\n\nhad finally\n\nfor him. Not only had he escaped from tutorial hell, he now had the confidence to go master anything else himself. That's the power of using deliberate practice to form long-term procedural memory.\n\nBy the way,\n\nis currently on a huge sale. Save a ton of time creating your own deliberate practice sessions for CSS Grid. I've got the full Mastery Game experience ready and waiting for you.\n\nMaster CSS Grid right from the start by playing this new mastery\n    game.

So I wanted to collect & share them here for any web devs/designers/etc who might need a little boost today. Here are 80 reasons to love the web:\n\nOn the web, everyone has a chance to reach out and connect with other like-minded individuals and share in this wondrous thing we call life.\n\nThe barrier to entry for new web developers is still low. Prototyping a new idea is as easy here as it is anywhere, and these two advantages have naturally led to a third: a vibrant, community of brilliant, creative minds. The web is able to foster superior community because community is built into its DNA. I can think of nowhere else that allows a person to be limited only by his or her imagination and to have access to a community as deep and wide as the web.\n\nThe web is just like us, different is so many ways but actually all alike!\n\nWho knows but maybe if we all remembered that a little more often this world, and the world wide web, might become something even greater!\n\nHow awesome is it that we're even\n\nto argue about things on the internet?

Surprisingly spartan on details, the board implies that the wizards at Brough Real Estate have made two sets of sellers, buyers and a themselves very happy, an increasingly difficult task in the current climate. Less believable is the fact these properties are directly opposite each other.\n\nClearly this is a ruse.\n\nWith a reported 350,000 properties on the market across the country, the question becomes, who is the audience for this call to action?\n\nTo steal a quote from\n\nthe best days of Australian housing bubble may be behind it. As an amateur economist and armchair property speculator I wanted to share my views on this subject.\n\nDuring the 60s and 70s Ashfield, the formerly Polish, now Chinese migrant, inner west suburb of Sydney succumbed to vast swathes of development which saw the majority of Colonial and Fediterania bungalows replaced by two and three story apartment blocks. Due of their ubiquity and near identical layout, these properties provide an opportunity to study the effects of the Australian housing boom on a particular class of asset; the quintessential two bedroom flat.\n\nSkipping forward a few decades to October 2009, it was a heady time for the Sydney housing market, and it was no different for Vendors in Ashfield. Landlords were dumping unrenovated 2 bedroom units onto the private market for $400,000 a pop. Saturday mornings saw Agents, weighed down with keys, leading platoons of eager DINKYs from inspecting to inspection. Estate agents, banks and solicitors were doing a roaring trade on the back of the dying months of the final extension of the First Home Buyers grant. Those who waited for the governments handouts to cease in the hope that the market would cool were out of luck, twelve months later I watched a 2br flat sell at auction for over $520,000.\n\nHowever the present day in Ashfield reveals a different picture. The previous weekend I attended two auctions with similar outcomes. The first apartment, a ground floor flat sold for $370,000 to the first, and only bidder. The second, with rubberneckers spilling onto the stairs, was passed in at $451,000 after the vendor bid failed to push the lacklustre bidding above the reserve.\n\n, and I believe the diagnosis to be accurate. Clearly my shoulder surfing a brace of sales does not represent a trend, and more data is needed before I can say the age of the half million dollar Ashfield flat is over.\n\nWhat is, however, less clear to me, is the prognosis for the price of 70 square meters of real estate in Ashfield."}

With singular exception of Google I/O, every one of these conferences, and every meetup, has spawned from the Go community itself.\n\nWithout a doubt, 2015 is going to be the year of Go.\n\nWhen I was younger, I wanted to learn to play the guitar (this was the 90\u2019s after all). So I cracked open my piggy bank, bought a decent beginners guitar and took some lessons. I regularly bought the guitar magazines that appeared in the local newsagent and practised along to my favourite songs.\n\nI noodled away at this hobby for a few years. I joined a local band, we even recorded a demo, but never got any gigs. I was disillusioned with my progress, sure I could memorise the fingerings and chords, but my playing style was wooden and my tone stank.\n\nFrustrated, I decided that my beginners guitar wasn\u2019t up to the task and again pouring over guitar magazines I invested in a better guitar, a wah pedal, and a fuzz pedal, and a new amplifier which proudly sported the ultimate in guitar fetishism \u2014 a solitary analogue tube.\n\nAlas, I had spent my time working to earn money to buy guitars and accessories instead of\n\n, my tone still stank, and my style remained wooden, and so when I moved out of home, my guitar didn\u2019t follow me.\n\nPhil Haley and is comments, circa 2002\n\nA few years after I joined the workforce, I bought a camera on a whim.\n\nIt was early in 2000, so I suspect this was a present to myself for surviving the Y2K debacle (Dave: 1, Mayans: 0). I discovered that some of my co-workers at the time were also keen on photography and this shared interest lead to heated debates about the benefits of Nikon vs Canon, zoom lenses vs prime lenses, the right film stock, and above all the absolute sharpness of the final product.\n\nSoon our cadre would spend hours searching eBay for bargains, or sneak out early on a Friday to ogle the new arrivals at the 2nd hand camera stores. This was the beginning of the end of 35mm film so cameras which, only a few years prior, had\u00a0been priced outside our reach were suddenly flooding the market.\n\nPretty soon I had amassed a huge array of Nikon lenses, tripods, adapters, cables, and accessories, and at one point I owned every Nikon professional camera from the F to the F4.\n\nTo my credit I put more time into photography than I had into music and after overcoming crippling indecision by whittling my camera collection back to one body and two lenses I started to take images that I was happy with.\n\nInstead of obsessing about the photographs I\n\ntake if I had just the right kit, I started investing that money in books and retrospectives of photographers who I admired.\n\nThis year it has become\n\nGo\u2019s explicit simplicity as crudeness or condescension.\u00a0To those critics\u00a0I say:\n\n.\n\nDespite your hand wringing over the effrontery of Go\u2019s designers to not include your prerequisite features, interest in Go is sky rocketing. Rather than finding new ways to hate a language for reasons that will not change, why not invest that time\u00a0and\n\nthe\n\nof programmers who are using the language to write real software\n\n.\n\nYou\u2019ll be amazed what you can get done when you\u00a0stop looking over your shoulder.\n\nI am frequently contacted by recruiters looking for leads. This isn\u2019t an attempt to blow my own horn, I\u2019m sure you are also constantly pestered.\n\nWhat is frustrating is the recruiters who come calling for leads are universally unaware of the meetups and user groups in the local area for the\n\nRecruiters, how do you expect to be effective in your role as go between if you do not make even the most basic of efforts to join the community for which you are claiming to be proficient in sourcing talent from ?\n\nSeveral decades ago, when I graduated high school and was wondering what I would do with my life I faced a choice. Should I take the now common \u201cgap year\u201d and travel the world, or should I enrol\u00a0directly in university ?\n\nOft quoted wisdom recommends that programmers looking to better themselves in their craft should frequently learn new programming languages.\n\nPolyglotism is in many ways like visiting a new country. You pick a destination from a list that interest you, choose a time when the weather is nice; not too hot, not to rainy, arrange your travel, and book your leave.\n\nMaybe you do a little research before you go, looking up the local attractions and learn a few basic phrases (although you know your accent will always give you away).\n\nTravel helps you broaden your horizons. You get to meet the locals, experience the weather, the food, their dialect. You visit the famous monuments, the popular hangouts, and take in the night life.\u00a0Maybe you have a friend who can show you their favourite haunts, off the beaten track, so you can feel like a local, in the know. Perhaps you hire a guide who helps you experience a safe, less homogenised, version of the city.\n\nThen, once you\u2019ve had your time abroad, exhausted, you slump down in your\u00a0airplane seat to return home. You reflect on the people you\u2019ve met, how their experiences are different to your own, what it would have been like to grow up with their challenges and their opportunities. Then it\u2019s back\u00a0to your old life and your old routine. Maybe, you dream, one day you\u2019ll visit that city again.\n\nThis post is not a rejection of polyglotism any more than it is a rejection of tourism for personal growth.\u00a0There is a great deal of difference between spending a week or two in a foreign city, and emigrating there.\u00a0Don\u2019t think because you\u2019ve spent a week with a language in the summer you know what it is like to live there permanently.\n\nThis is the text of my closing keynote from Gophercon India. It has been slightly altered for readability from my original speaking notes.\n\nI am indebted to the organisers of Gophercon India for inviting\u00a0me to speak, and to Canonical for giving me the time off to attend the conference.\n\nIf you want to see me stumble through the real thing, the video is\n\n.\n\nClosing Keynote, Gophercon India\n\n21 Feb 2015\n\nI want to open my presentation with a proposition.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/davecheney/status/539576755254611968\n\nBeing passionate about Go means being passionate about language advocacy, and a natural hazard of dwelling too long on the nature of programming results in statements like these.\n\nBut underlying the pithy form enforced by a tweet, I believe there is a gem of truth\u2014\n\nOn the other hand, I cannot point to a language introduced in the same time frame with the rallying call of complexity; more complexity than its contemporaries\u2014but many instead claim to be powerful.\n\nThe idea of proposing a language which offered higher levels of inherent complexity is clearly laughable, yet this is exactly what so many contemporary languages have become; complicated, baroque, messes. A parody of the languages they sought to replace.\n\nClumsy syntax and non orthogonality is justified by the difficulty of capturing nuanced corner cases of the language, many of them self inflicted by years of careless feature creep.\n\nSo, every language starts out with simplicity as a goal, yet many of them fail to achieve this goal. Eventually falling back on notions of expressiveness or power of the language as justification for a failure to remain simple.\n\nAny why is this ? Why do so many language, launched with sincere, idealistic goals, fall afoul of their own self inflicted complexity ?\n\nOne reason, one major reason, I believe, is that to be thought successful, a language should somehow include all the popular features of its predecessors.\n\nIf you would listen to language critics, they demand that any new language should push forward the boundaries of language theory.\n\nIn reality\u00a0this appears to be a veiled request that your new language include all the bits they felt were important in their favourite old language, while still holding true to the promise of whatever it was that drew them to investigate your language I the first place.\n\nI believe that this is a fundamentally incorrect view.\n\nWhy would a new language be proposed if not to address limitations of its predecessors ?\n\nWhy should a new language not aim to represent a refinement of the cornucopia of features presented in existing languages, learning from its predecessors, rather than repeating their folly.\n\nLanguage design is about trade-offs; you cannot have your cake and eat it too.\u00a0So I challenge the notion that every mainstream language must be a super-set of those it seeks to replace.\n\nThis brings me back to my tweet.\n\nGo is a language that chooses to be simple, and it does so by choosing to not include many features that other programming languages have accustomed their users to believing are essential.\n\nSo the subtext of this thesis would be; what makes Go successful is what has been left out of the language, just as much as what has been included.\n\nOr as Rob Pike puts it \u201cless is exponentially more\u201d.\n\nWhen raising a new building, engineers first sink long pillars, down to the bedrock to provide a stable foundation for the structure of the building.\n\nTo not do this, to just tamp the area flat, lay a concrete slab and start construction, would leave the building vulnerable to small disturbances from changes in the local area, at risk from rising damp or subsidence due to changes in environmental conditions.\n\nAs programmers, we can recognise this as the parable of leaky abstraction. Just as tall buildings can only be successfully constructed by placing them on a firm foundation, large programs can not be successful if they are placed upon a loose covering of dirt that masks decades of accumulated debris.\n\nYou cannot add simplicity after the fact. Simplicity is only gained by taking things away.\n\nSimplicity does not mean\n\n, but it may mean\n\n\u009d or\n\n.\n\nSomething which is simple may take a little longer, it may be a little more verbose, but it will be more comprehensible.\n\nPutting this into the context of programming languages, a simple programming language may choose to limit the number of semantic conveniences it offers to experienced programmers to avoid alienating newcomers.\n\nSimplicity is not a synonym for easy, nor is achieving a design which is simple an easy task.\n\nJust because something may be simple, don\u2019t mistake it for crude.\n\nWhile lasers are fabulous technology used in manufacturing and medicine, a chef prefers a knife to prepare food.\n\nCompared to the laser, a simple chefs knife may appear unsophisticated, but in truth it represents generations of knowledge in metallurgy, manufacturing and usability.\n\nWhen considering a programming language, don\u2019t mistake a lack of the latest features for a lack of sophistication.\n\n\u201cnothing went in [to the language], until all three of us [Ken, Robert and myself], agreed that it was a good idea.\u201d \u2014 Rob Pike, Gophercon 2014\n\nYou should design your programs with simplicity as a goal, not aim to be pleasantly surprised when your solution happens to be simple.\n\nAs Rob Pike noted at Gophercon last year, Go was not designed by committee. The language represent a distillation of the experiences of Robert Griesemer, Ken Thompson, and himself, and only once all three\u00a0were all convinced of a feature\u2019s utility to the language was it included.\n\nThere is an exponential cost in completeness.\n\nThe 90% solution, a language\u00a0that remains orthogonal while recognizing some things are not possible, verses a language attempting to offer 100% of its capabilities to every possible permutation will inherently be less complex, because as we engineers know,\n\nThe last 10% costs another 90% of the effort.\n\nA lack of simplicity is, of course complexity.\n\nComplexity is friction, a force which acts against getting things done.\n\nComplexity is debt, it robs you of capital to invest in the future.\n\nGood programmers write simple programs.\n\nThey bring their experience, their knowledge and their failures to new designs, to learn from and avoid mistakes in the future.\n\nTo steal a quote from Rich Hickey\n\n\u201cSimplicity is the ultimate sophistication\u201d \u2014\u00a0Leonardo da Vinci\n\nGo is a language designed to be simple. It is a feature, not a by-product, or an accident.\n\nThis was the message that spoke to me when I first learned about the language in 2009, and is the message that has stayed with me to this day.\n\nThe desire for simplicity is woven through every aspect of the language.\n\nMy question for you, the audience: Do you want to write simple programs, or will you settle for writing powerful programs ?\n\nI hope by now I have convinced you that a need for simplicity in programming languages, is self evident, so I want to move to my second topic; collaboration.\n\nIs programming an art or a science ? Are we artists or engineers ? This one question is a debate in itself, but I hope you will humour me that as professionals, programming is a little of both; we are both software artists, and software engineers\u2014and as engineers we work as a team.\n\nThere is more to the success of Go than just being simple, and this is the realization that for a programming language to be successful, it must coexist inside a larger environment.\n\nLarge programs are written by large teams.\u00a0I don\u2019t believe this is a controversial statement.\n\nThe inverse is also true.\u00a0Large teams of programmers, by their nature, produce large code bases.\n\nProjects with large goals will necessitate large teams, and thus their output will be commensurate.\n\nThis is the nature of our work.\n\nGo is a small language, but deliberately designed as a language for large teams of programmers.\n\nSmall annoyances such as a lack of warnings, a refusal to allow unused imports, or unused local variables, are all facets of choices designed to help Go work well for large teams.\n\nThis does not mean that Go is not suitable for the single developer working alone, or a small program written for a specific need, but speaks to the fact that a number of the choices within the language are aimed at the needs of growing software teams.\n\nAnd if your project is successful, your team will grow, so you need to plan for it.\n\nIt may appear heretical to suggest this, as many of the metrics that we as professional software developers are judged by; lines of code written; the number of revisions committed to source control, and so on, are all accounted for character by character. Line by line. File by file.\n\nBut, writing a program, or more accurately solving a problem; delivering a solution, has little to do with the final act of entering the program into the computer.\n\nPrograms are designed, written, debugged and distributed in an environment significantly larger than one programmer\u2019s editor.\n\nGo recognizes this, it is a language designed to work in this larger environment, not in spite of it.\n\nBecause ultimately Go is a language for the problems that exist in today\u2019s commercial programming, not just language theory.\n\nThe author Peter Seibel suggests that programs are not read, but instead decoded.\u00a0In hindsight this should have been obvious, after all we call it\n\n, not\n\n.\n\nThe source code of a program is an intermediary form, somewhere between our concept and the computer\u2019s executable notation.\n\nAs with many transformations, this encoding of the source program is not lossless; some loss of fidelity, some ambiguity, some imprecision is present. This is why when reading source code, you must in fact\n\nit, to divine the original intention of the programmer.\n\nMany of the choices relating to the way Go code is represented as source, speak to this impedance mismatch. The simplicity and regularity of the grammar, while providing few opportunities for individuality, in turn makes it easier for a new reader to decode a Go program and determine its function.\n\nBecause source code is written to be read.\n\nGo is a language designed from the beginning to be transposed, transformed and processed at the source level. This has opened up new fields of analysis and code generation to the wider Go community.\u00a0We\u2019ve seen several examples of this demonstrated at this conference.\n\nWhile these tools are impressive, I believe the regular syntax of a Go source file belies its greatest champion; go fmt.\n\nBut what is it that is so important about go fmt, and why is it important to go fmt your source code ?\n\nPart of the reason is, of course, to avoid needless debate. Large teams will, by their nature have a wide spectrum of views on many aspects of programming, and source code formatting is the most pernicious.\n\nGo is a language for collaboration. So, in a large team, just as in a wider community, personal choices are moderated for a harmonious society.\n\nThe outcome is that nearly all go code is go formatted\n\n. Adherence to this convention is an indicator of alignment with the values of Go.\n\nThis is important because it is a social convention leading to positive reinforcement, which is far more powerful than negative reinforcement of a chafing edict from the compiler writer.\n\nIn fact, code that is not well formatted can be a first order indicator of the suitability of the package.\u00a0Now, I\u2019m not trying to say that poorly formatted code is buggy, but poorly formatted code may be an indication that the authors have not understood the design principles that underscore Go.\n\nSo while buggy code can be fixed, design issues or impedance mismatches can be much harder to address, especially after that code is integrated into your program.\n\nAs Go programmers we can pick up a piece of Go code written by anyone in the world and start to read it.\u00a0This goes deeper than just formatting.\n\nGo lacks heavy libraries like Boost. There are no QT base classes, no gobject. There is no pre-processor to obfuscate. Domain specific language rarely appear in Go code.\n\nThe inclusion of maps and slices in the language side steps the most basic interoperability issues integrating packages from vendors, or other parts of your company. All Go code uses these same basic building blocks; maps, slices and channels, so all Go code is accessible to a reader who is versed in the language, not some quaint organization specific dialect.\n\nIn 1964 Doug McIlroy postulated about the power of pipes for composing programs. This was five years before the first Unix was written mind you.\n\nMcIlroy\u2019s observations became the foundation of the UNIX philosophy; small, sharp tools which can be combined to solve larger tasks, tasks which\u00a0may not have even been envisioned by the original authors.\n\nIn the last few decades, I feel that programmers have lost the ability to compose programs, lost behind waves of run time dependencies, stifling frameworks, and brittle type hierarchies that degrade the ability to move quickly and experiment cheaply.\n\nGo programs embody the spirit of the UNIX philosophy. Go packages interact with one another via interfaces. Programs are composed, just like the UNIX shell, by combining packages together.\n\nI can use fmt.Fprintf to write formatted output to a network connection, or a zip file, or a writer which discards its input. Conversely I can create a gzip reader that consumes data from a http connection, or a string constant, or a multireader composed of several sources.\n\nAll of these permutations are possible, in McIlroy\u2019s vision, without any of the components having the slightest bit of knowledge about the other parts of this processing chain.\n\nInterfaces in Go are therefore a unifying force; they are\n\nmeans of describing behaviour. Interfaces let programmers describe what their package provides, not\n\nit does it.\n\nWell designed interfaces are more likely to be small interfaces; the prevailing idiom here is that interfaces contain\u00a0only a single method.\n\nCompare this to other languages like Java or C++. In those languages interfaces are generally larger, in terms of the method count required to satisfy them, and more complex because of their entanglement with the inheritance based nature of those languages.\n\nInterfaces in Go share none of those restrictions and so are simpler, yet at the same time, are more powerful, and more composable, and critical to the narrative of collaboration, interfaces in Go are satisfied\n\n.\n\nAny Go type, written at any time, in any package, by any programmer, can implement an interface by simply providing the methods necessary to satisfy the interface\u2019s contract.\n\nIt follows logically that small interfaces lead to simple implementations,\u00a0because it is hard to do otherwise. Leading to packages comprised of simple implementations connected by common interfaces.\n\nI\u2019ve written a lot about the subject of Go\u2019s error handling, so I\u2019ll restrict my comments here to errors as they relate to collaboration.\n\nThe error interface is the key to Go\u2019s composable error handling story.\n\nIf you\u2019ve worked on some large Go projects you may have come across packages like Canonical\u2019s errgo, which provide facilities to apply a stack trace to an error value. Perhaps the project has\u00a0rolled their own implementation. Maybe you have developed something similar in house.\n\nI want to be clear that I am remaining neutral on the relative goodness or badness of the idea of gift wrapping errors.\n\nWhat I do want to highlight is even though one piece of code you integrate uses fmt.Errorf, and another a third party package, and in your package you have developed your own error handling type. From the point of view of you the programmer consuming your work, the error handling strategy\n\nlooks the same. If the error is nil, the call worked.\n\nCompare this to the variety of error handling strategies that must be managed in other languages as programs grow through accretion of dependencies.\n\nThis is the key to a Go programmer\u2019s ability to write an application at any size without sacrificing reliability. In the context of collaboration, it must be said that Go\u2019s error handling strategy is the only form that makes sense.\n\nGo\u2019s lack of Makefiles is more than a convenience.\n\nWith other programming languages, when you integrate a piece of third party code, maybe it\u2019s something complex, like v8, or something more mundane, like a database driver from your vendor, you\u2019re integrating that code into your program, this part is obvious, but you are also integrating their build system.\n\nThis is a far less visible, and sometimes far more intractable problem. You\u2019ve not just introduced a dependency on that piece of code, but also a dependency on its build system, be it cmake, scons, gnu autotools, what have you.\n\nGo simply doesn\u2019t have this problem.\n\nPutting aside the contentious issues of package versioning, once you have the source in your $GOPATH, integrating any\u00a0piece of third party Go code into your program is just an import statement.\n\nGo programs are built from just their source, which has everything you need to know to compile a Go program. I think this is a hugely important and equally under-appreciated part of Go\u2019s collaboration story.\n\nThis is also the key to Go\u2019s efficient compilation. The source indicates only those things that it depends on, and nothing else. Compiling your program will touch only the lines of source necessary.\n\nDoes your heart sink when you want to try the hottest new project from Hacker News or Reddit only find it requires node.js, or some assortment of Ruby dependencies that aren\u2019t available on your operating system ? Or you have to look up what is the correct way to install a python package this week. Is it pip, is it easy_install, does that need an egg, or are they wheels ?\n\nI can tell you mine does.\n\nFor Go programmers dependency management remains an open wound, this is a fact, and one that I am not proud of. But for users of programs written in Go their life just got a whole lot easier; compile the program, scp it to the server, job done.\n\nGo\u2019s ability to produce stand alone applications; and even cross compile them directly from your workstation\u00a0means that programmers are rediscovering the lost art of shipping a program, a real compiled program, the exact same one they tested, to customers.\n\nThis one fact alone has allowed Go to establish a commanding position in the container orchestration market, a market which arguably would not exist in its current form if not for Go\u2019s deployment story.\n\nThis story also illustrates how Go\u2019s design decisions move beyond just thinking about how the programmer and the language will interact during the development phase, and extend right through the software life-cycle to the deployment phase.\n\nGo\u2019s choice of a single static binary is directly influenced by Google\u2019s experiences deploying their own large complex applications, and I believe their advice should not be dismissed lightly.\n\nC# isn\u2019t portable, it is joined at the hip to a Windows host.\n\nSwift and Objective-C are in the same boat, they live in the land of Apple only programming languages. Popular ? yes, but portable ? no.\n\nJava, Scala, Groovy, and all the rest of the languages built atop the JVM may benefit from the architecture independence of the JVM bytecode format, until you realize that Oracle is only interested in supporting the JVM on its own hardware.\n\nJava is tone deaf to the requirements of the machine it is executing on. The JVM is too sandboxed, too divorced from the reality of the environment it is working inside.\n\nRuby and Python are better citizens in this regard, but are hamstrung by their clumsy deployment strategies.\n\nIn the new world of metered cloud deployments in which we find ourselves, where you pay by the hour, the difference between a slow interpreted language, and a nimble compiled Go program is stark.\n\nGo\u2019s fresh take on portability, without the requirement to abstract yourself away from the machine your program runs on, is like no other language available today.\n\nFor the last few decades, since the rise of interpreted languages, or virtual machine run-times, programming has been less about writing small targeted tools, and more about managing the complexity of the environment those tools are deployed into.\n\nSlow languages, or bloated deployments encourage programmers to pile additional functionality into one application to amortize the cost of installation and set up.\n\nI believe that we are in the early stage of a command line renaissance, a renaissance driven by the rediscovery of languages which produce compiled, self contained, programs. Go is leading this charge.\n\nA command line renaissance which enables developers to deliver simple programs that fit together, cross platform, in a way that suites the needs of the nascent cloud automation community, and reintroduces a generation of programmers to the art of writing tools which fit together, as Doug McIlroy described, \u201clike segments in a garden hose\u201d.\n\nA key part of the renaissance is Go\u2019s deployment story. I spoke earlier and many of my fellow speakers have praised Go for its pragmatic deployment story, focusing on server side deployments, but I believe there is more to this.\n\nOver the last year we\u2019ve seen a number of companies shift their\n\nside tools from interpreted languages like Ruby and Python to Go. Cloud Foundry\u2019s tools, Github\u2019s hub, and MongoDB\u2019s tool suite are the ones that spring to mind.\n\nIn every case their motivations were similar; while the existing tools worked well, the support load from customers who were not able to get the tool installed correctly on their machine was huge.\n\nGo lets you write command line applications, that in turn enables developers to leverage the UNIX philosophy; small, sharp tools that work well together.\n\nThis is a command line renaissance that has been missing for a generation.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/supermighty/status/548897982016663552\n\nGo is a simple language, this was not an accident.\n\nThis was a deliberate decision, executed brilliantly by experienced designers who struck a chord with pragmatic developers.\n\nPut simply, Go is a language for programmers who want to get things done.\n\n\u201cI just get things done instead of talking about getting them done.\u201d\u00a0\u2014 Henry Rollins\n\nAs Andrew Gerrand noted in his fifth birthday announcement\n\n\u201cGo arrived as the industry underwent a tectonic shift toward cloud computing, and we were thrilled to see it quickly become an important part of that movement.\u201d \u2014 Andrew Gerrand\n\nGo\u2019s success is directly attributable to the factors that motivated its designers. As Rob Pike noted in his 2012 Splash paper.\n\n\u201cGo is a language designed by Google to help solve Google\u2019s problems; and Google has big problems\u201d \u2014 Rob Pike\n\nAnd it turns out that Go\u2019s design choices are applicable to the problems that an increasing number of professional programmers face today.\n\nNovember last year, Go turned 5 years old as a public project.\n\nIn these 5 years, less if you consider that the language only reached 1.0 in April of 2012, Go, as a language, and a proposition to programmers and development teams, has been wildly successful.\n\nIn 2014 there were five international Go conferences. In 2015 there will be\n\n.\n\nLastly, look around this room and see your peers, 350 experienced programmers, who have decided in invest in Go.\n\nThis paper describes the language we have today. A language built with care and moderation. The language is what it is because of deliberate decisions that were made at every step.\n\nLanguage design is about trade-offs, so learn to appreciate the care in which Go\u2019s features were chosen and the skill in which they were combined.\n\nWhile the language strives for simplicity, and is easy to learn, it does not immediately follow that the language is trivial to master.\n\nThere is a lot to love in our language, don\u2019t be in such a hurry to dismiss it before you have explored it fully.\n\nLearn to love the language.\n\nlearn the language. It\u2019ll take longer than you would think.\n\nLearn to appreciate the choices of the designers.\n\nBecause, and I truly mean this, Go will make you a better programmer.\n\nCross compilation is one of Go\u2019s headline features. I\u2019ve written about it a\n\n, and others have taken this work and built\n\naround it.\n\nThis morning Russ Cox committed\n\nwhich resolved the\n\nin making cross compilation simpler and more accessible for all Gophers. When Go 1.5 ships in August any Go programmer will be able to cross compile their program without having to go through a fussy\u00a0set up phase.\n\nIn the current version of Go, (if you\u2019re from the future, read Go 1.4 and earlier) before you could cross compile a Go program, you needed to go through a set up phase to enhance your Go installation with the bits necessary to build for other platforms.\n\nThis worked ok if you had built Go from source, but if you were using one of the binary distributions or something from your operating system (brew, apt, etc), then the process would turn into a maze of twisty passages, all alike.\n\nThis was necessary because for successful cross compilation you would need\n\nWith the plan to translate the\n\ncoming to fruition in the 1.5 release the first issue is now resolved. That just left the small amount of customisation to the runtime done at installation time, which has been whittled away as part of the compiler transition (most of the customisation was generation of include files for the C parts of the runtime), and as of this morning,\n\n.\n\nIf you can\u2019t wait til August, you can try this out today by building the development version of Go.\n\nAs mentioned above to build the development version of Go, you also need Go 1.4 installed to\n\n. Once Go 1.5 comes out this step will be unnecessary.\n\nThese steps are a simple procedure to do this which I would recommend following\n\nNow you have the development version of Go 1.5 installed, cross compiling this simple program is trivial\n\nNow build for darwin/386\n\nOr build for linux/arm\n\nCross compilation can\u2019t get any simpler than that.\n\nSo what is happening under the hood when we compile a program for a different platform ? The\n\nflag gives us a clue.\n\nComparing the two examples above, the first build is using the standard library that was built as part of the Go installation. That is to say, all the packages that\n\nand\n\ndepend on are already built into\n\n.\n\nIn the second example, the\n\ntool detects that all the dependencies of this program need to be built for the target plaform before\n\ncan be compiled and builds them, all the way back to the\n\npackage.\n\nI have not included the output here because it is very verbose, but you can look at all the steps that are being performed if you pass the\n\nflag to\n\n.\n\nCross compilation while linking to libraries via cgo is the holy grail for some. Sadly the changes mentioned above do not change the situation with respect to cgo. In fact you may still need to rebuild your Go installation in the traditional way to pass environment variables like\n\n. Please try it out.\n\nIn case you can\u2019t tell, I\u2019m over the moon about this improvement. Cross compilation is Go\u2019s ace in the hole and Go 1.5 will make it even better.\n\nPlease try it out and if you find issues please let us know on the\n\n."}

Time passes and finally a few bombers struggle back to their base, the crew shaken, but alive, their aircraft riddled with bullet holes.\n\nShocked by their losses, the reaction by Air Force was to order the areas of the air frame wounded by enemy fire be reinforced with additional armor plating to improve the success of future missions.\n\nFortunately for the Allies, a statistician engaged by the British raised the issue that the aircraft that had returned, although battle scared, were hit in places not crucial for flight. In comparison, their missing comrades had not fared so well. Having succumb to enemy fire, the damage their aircraft suffered could not be accounted for.\n\nThus, the statistician argued, the portions of the aircraft which should receive additional armor should the places which\n\nsuffer damage.\u00a0This then is a tale about Selection Bias.\n\nThirty years later, Frederick P Brooks, Jr wrote his seminal work,\n\n. Brooks\u2019 observation that \u201c\n\n\u201d\u00a0has become a rallying cry for the software development industry;\u00a0one which we have had no shortage of opportunities to validate against a steady stream of prominent projects who over promised yet under delivered.\n\nHowever, for all our well founded chortling, I wonder if we are not succumbing to our own selection bias. For all the attempts to throw people at a floundering project is there a percentage of teams that quietly pull it off, meet their audacious schedule and live to code another day ?\n\nIs Brooks\u2019 law an axiom of the software development industry, or are we simply counting the losers and drawing the wrong conclusion?\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in the performance improvements delivered in Go 1.2, I\u2019ve written about it as part of this years Go Advent project.\n\nYou can find the post on the Gopher Academy blog,\n\n."}

It's better than my old one (d15.biz) in my opinion. \"d15\" doesn't have\n\nmuch meaning (apart from people that know it means \"Daniel15\"), whereas \"dan\" is a lot better.

I also got\n\nlast night, but I'm not sure where I'll use that (\"daniel good?\" I dunno). It currently just redirects to dan.cx. I should probably stop buying domains.

I don't really work on MySpaceTools any more, so I'm just letting the domain expire. \ud83d\ude1b\n\nI guess you've probably noticed, but I've been doing some updates to my site (finally!). I rewrote it to use my own very simple CMS \u00a0(instead of a static HTML file), and added a\n\nshowing some of the bigger projects I've worked on in the past. I'm considering switching the site to be fully WordPress (instead of just the blog), but I haven't done that just yet. Not sure if I will, I'm happy with the simple CMS for now. I thought WordPress might be easier for site management though. And the main part of the site is the blog, which might be better in the root. I dunno.\n\nA proper blog post will come eventually. One day. \ud83d\ude03\n\nUntil next time,\n\n\u2014 Daniel\n\nWell, I haven't blogged for a while (seems to happen to me quite often). I was pretty busy with university work, exams, arranging a work placement for next year for IBL, and other stuff. I get my exam results in about one and a half weeks, hopefully I did alright on them. We'll see I guess...\n\nMany of you know about my girlfriend. If not, her name is\n\n, and she's absolutely\n\n\ud83d\ude04. We met online on MySpace (haha) towards the end of September 2008. I had broken up with my ex-girlfriend after a short and hopeless relationship in August 2008. I was rather upset after my ex broke up with me (to be honest, I really have no idea why, looking back at it now), and was just looking for people to talk to, to make me feel better. I was browsing MySpace one of those days, and was looking through\n\n's (you know, the guy with the pretend friends) blog, where Ciera had posted a comment on one of the posts. There was something about her in particular (the way she wrote? Her picture? I really don't know) that made me click on her and take a look at her profile. Now, I don't know\n\nthis happened (even today, neither me nor her know why things happened the way they did), but I'm glad it did. Reading her profile made me realise that we had so much in common! I sent a friend request right away, wondering if she'd accept and become my friend. I really wanted to get to know her more.\n\nLuckily, she accepted my friend request. We started talking on MySpace, and eventually on Windows Live Messenger. We chat for\n\nand hours every day... It made me really happy (still does today), and made me forget about my ex-girlfriend and what happened with her. We kept learning more and more about each other, and got closer and closer. It was amazing how much we have in common! After about a month, we started to realise how we felt about each other. What started as a good friendship was definitely growing into something bigger (bigger is better, right?). There was only one problem with this \u2014 Distance. You see, while I'm here in Australia, she's all the way in the USA. We were so close, and yet physically we were so so far away from each other. Quite annoying really \ud83d\ude26. She told me that when she finds a job, she'd start saving up to come see me!\n\nFast-forward eight months later, to June 2009, and Ciera was on her way here! She had saved up some money for the flight here, and I contributed some money towards it as well. It was so unbelievable, finally getting to be with her. I honestly didn't know what to expect, but I knew things were going to be alright (since me and Ciera were extra-close by this time \ud83d\ude04). And things were\n\nthan just \"alright\" \u2014\u00a0The whole experience was\n\n! We had a great time staying together! She was here for three months, and we did so much in that time! I showed her around some places in Melbourne, and we just generally \u00a0had a great time. Just holding hands and even just being in the same room as each other felt so amazing after dreaming about it for so long. It was really like a dream come true to us. \u00a0It was really upsetting when she had to leave though, and I still miss her all the time \ud83d\ude26. At least now I know who I'm going to spend my life with. It's a great feeling knowing someone as amazing and attractive as Ciera. \ud83d\ude03\n\nBeing in a long-distance relationship has been quite an experience. While it's quite hard and I miss her every day, knowing that she's there for me and we'll be together one day is an amazing thing. I miss her heaps. I miss her smile, her laugh, everything about her. Being able to chat to her every day helps HEAPS though. It makes me feel like she's with me, even though we're physically so far away.\u00a0 A lot of people say that online relationships don't work, but me and Ciera are proving them wrong \ud83d\ude04. I love her more than anyone else I've ever met, and I have a feeling things will be like this forever. We're both working towards seeing each other again, and it'll be amazing. Like I mentioned at the start, I have a work placement next year. If that goes well, I'll save all the money from that, and use it to fly over to see her at the end of the year. That's pretty far away, but it'll be incredible when it happens. It'll be the first time I've travelled outside Australia (outside Victoria, even).\n\nCiera's also\n\non\n\n, if you want to read her one.\n\nUntil next time,\n\n\u2014 Daniel"}

I wanted to do something special, seeing as this year's the first year I've considered buying something for someone \ud83d\ude1b. Apart from that, I haven't been doing all that much. Over the last few weeks, I worked on a few programming projects, then got bored of that and stopped working on them xD. Nothing much apart from that, just the usual chatting on Windows Live Messenger, and browsing Digg, news.com.au, and some other sites.\n\nI go back to university on Monday... Second year of\n\n, should be fun \ud83d\ude03. No usability this semester!

Not another XSS hole, this is a different security hole with some privacy implications.

However, if someone were to do something like that, assuming it's posted anonymously, nothing bad would happen. So, the thing that's the most \"correct\" (reporting it to them) would get punished (as my previous reported security hole showed), whereas the thing that's \"wrong\" (posting it to a security site) wouldn't. Isn't it obvious what most people would do? How funny.\n\n\u2014 Daniel\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI got bored today and thought it might be fun to make a MySpace profile layout that looks like Facebook. Considering I'm not a designer, I'm rather happy with how it turned out. There's a screenshot to the right, click on it to see a full-size version.\n\nI haven't tested in Internet Explorer, but that shouldn't be much of an issue, as most people are using better browsers... Right?\n\nPlease feel free to use this layout on your profile. The only thing I ask is that you keep the credit (Layout by Daniel15) on the page, and in the CSS code itself.\n\nHere's what you need to do if you want to use this layout on your MySpace profile. You should probably already know how to use a MySpace Profile 2.0 layout, but here's a brief overview:\n\nIf you don't like the header, and would prefer the default MySpace one, delete everything between\n\nand\n\nNote I'm giving\n\nfor this layout. I can try to help you with bugs in the layout itself, but can't help you with anything beyond that. Having said that, please feel free to leave a comment if you find any issues with the layout.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\u2014 Daniel\n\nA while back, I reported a security problem to MySpace. Being a nice person, I thought I'd email them and wait for a reply before telling anyone else (I thought I was the only one to find this problem, but it appears a few others knew of it too. I didn't know this until later). I have reported a few problems to MySpace in the past, and they usually took around two weeks or so to reply. Sure, their reply was something generic, but it was a reply at least. Anyways, back to this story. So, after writing to them, I waited two weeks. Didn't hear anything back from them. A month, still didn't hear anything. So I thought that as a month had passed, I may as well report the security hole to a security site. I wrote to xssed.com, and after a small wait they published an article on it.\n\nToday, I try to log in to my account, and it didn't work. Interesting, I was sure I was typing the correct password. I go to use the \"Forgot your password?\", and it says my email is invalid. So that's it, they've\n\n. For me, MySpace was a way to keep in touch with old friends I otherwise wouldn't be able to talk to. And now they've deleted my account. So, they deleted my account for\n\na security issue and showing them a\n\n, yet people that actively try to attack MySpace accounts still have active accounts? This makes no sense, if anything they should be thanking me for finding the bug on their site, and being nice enough not to do anything evil with it. It's totally unfair. Just before deleting the account, I had 467 friends, 1991 comments, 2300 messages, and just over 19000 profile views. I have no clue what's going to happen to my\n\n, an application that now has\n\n.  Whatever, I'm done with MySpace now. I made a new account but don't really care about it any more.

Mainly due to real-life getting in the way. Yeah, real life gets like that sometimes, it's rather annoying \ud83d\ude1b . That, and the fact that I'm lazy - I won't really do anything unless I'm forced to (or force myself to). Well actually, most people are like this, it's just very few seem to admit it. And realisation is the first step to admitting you have a problem, right? \ud83d\ude1b . And I haven't really had anything to blog about either. Aaaand this blog has approximately 0 readers. I don't think anyone is even reading what I'm writing right now. If you're one of the 0 readers, then HELLOOOOOOOO TO YOOOOOOUUUUUU!!! I have a cookie for you, come and get it before I eat it.\n\nWell anyways, enough of my stupid rambling... my first year of University is finally over, and geez did the time pass quickly \ud83d\ude10 !  It was generally enjoyable, way way more so than high school was. University life is completely different to high school, in a sense it's a lot more relaxed. Some people take advantage of this and try to breeze through Uni without studying... And end up dropping out \ud83d\ude1b.  I tried concentrating in class (moreso than last year at high school), but in the end I just ended up not paying attention at all, and rushing all my last assignments (isn't this the case with everyone?). Results day is\n\n, so I guess I'll be worrying about my results until then. There's one... no, wait, two things I really hated though:\n\nOkay, sure, everyone hates exams. Me moreso than most I reckon. I seriously HATE HATE HATE exams. On a scale from 1 to OMG I HATE THIS, it'd be on the very end. Seriously. They drive me crazy. Crazier than I normally am, and that's a LOT. \ud83d\ude2e I seem to often forget everything and have a whole heap of stuff rush back to me at the last minute. I hate it, haha. At least these exams aren't as bad as the\n\n(or maybe Usability is that bad... I'll get to that in a bit)\n\nAnd especially one of my subjects was a subject about website development using HTML. We had to\n\nHTML (yes, by hand) in the exam. Seriously, what is that testing? Most (hell,\n\n) normal web developers always have references handy (HTML for Dummies, Complete All-In-One Website Reference, Garfield comic strips out of their local news paper, whatever), they don't need to know all HTML stuff off the top of their head (and certainly don't need to write it on paper). But this subject was nowhere near as bad as everyone's enemy:\n\nFalling over might be enjoyable. Jumping off a cliff could potentially be enjoyable. But this,\n\n, this subject is not enjoyable at all, it's literally the worst subject. Ever. Well maybe not really, but it's boring. Most of the class was common knowledge (you know, things like \"red writing on a green background looks fugly\", \"make sure users find your software interface easy to use\", and \"don't stab people\"). I'm hoping we don't get more subjects that are as annoying as this one was. If we do, I'm stabbing someone with a red and green paper. An easy-to-use one.\n\nGo-karts? Did someone mention go-karts? Oh yeah, it was an idea I had when I was around 8 years old or so. I had this amazingly awesome (and by \"amazingly awesome\" I mean \"it sounded good at the time\") idea to build a go-kart that goes along the tram lines (anyone not living in Melbourne should look up \"Melbourne Trams\" on Wikipedia to see these mythical \"tram\" thingies I'm talking about). But basically, trams are a form of public transportation here, a form of light rail. The streets have tram lines in the middle of the street, kinda like a train line except it's on the road instead of being separate. Trams have overhead powerlines, which is what gave me this idea. Instead of the go-kart needing petrol or a battery, it could simply use the power the trams are using. Although now I realise several downfalls with this:\n\nSo what else can I say? There's not much really, my life's pretty boring right now. Oh yes, my girlfriend and I broke up, I guess just things weren't working out. So yeah, I'm single again. And no I'm not looking for a girlfriend at the moment, so don't bother asking (unless you like the feeling of being rejected I guess) xD. I guess that made me realise a lot more about myself, who I am and exactly\n\nI'm looking for. I made a special friend that I'm very similar and now extremely close to, it's like we're soulmates or something. She knows who she is, and I'm pretty certain she'd be reading this (maybe she's the one of the 0 readers \ud83d\ude2e ) \ud83d\ude03. As a person I've changed pretty significantly over the past year or so (especially in the last few months), and it really seems like a pretty good thing. But I'll save all of this for another blog post, this one's getting rather long. I should try to blog more about life I guess, it's something I like writing about. If you look through the firsts posts to this blog, they were pretty geeky. Then again, I've become way less geeky (still do programming though), haha \ud83d\ude1b . It all fits in to the whole \"change\" thing.\n\nOh, and for anyone from Australia, the NoCleanFeed protests are on the\n\n(same as Swinburne results day!). For more information take a look at\n\n. The protests in Melbourne are going to be at the state library, and I\n\nbe going, I'm not sure yet. Perhaps you want some\n\n, thanks to my friend Joseph. \ud83d\ude04\n\nWell that's all for now...\n\nOh and btw, the cookie's all gone. Sorry about that.\n\nUntil next time \ud83d\ude03"}
