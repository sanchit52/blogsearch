Camels have pretty silly (and grumpy) personalities as it is, but the Bactrian variety have wildly ridiculous camel humps. I got up close and personal with some at a wild live reserve kinda\u2019 thing once.\n\nPlant Superpower\n\nHonestly I did some web searching to find cool \u201cabilities\u201d I would want to steal from a plant and came up kinda empty. Fire resistance, regeneration, growing super tall\u2014these are all things that are kinda cool, but nothing specific stood out to me. So, as my pick, I\u2019ve decided to go with the wise old Oak Tree. For any particular ability? Not really. I just like the idea of being a chill old Oak Tree that animals love to hang out with.\n\nFavorite Nature Sound\n\nI\u2019d say it\u2019s a close tie between the sound of a mountain stream and that of a rain storm with low, rolling thunder.\n\nThe Perfect Nature Spot\n\nEasy. Western-facing, mountain-side cabin. Conifers as far as the eye can see. A mountain creek babbles nearby. The glow of a camp fire flickers across my face as I watch the sun melt behind the distant peaks.\n\nThanks for reading!", "label": "non_personal"}
{"title": "One of us", "url": "https://shellsharks.com/notes/2024/05/14/one-of-us", "content": "Mike Sass\n\n@shellsharks\n\nI recently came across this post where the author laments that the IndieWeb is \u201cnot for them\u201d, simply because of their inability to implement Webmentions and thus (as they put it) the \u201cIndieWeb is a social club for developers\u201d only. (See also this one with respect to not feeling part of the \u201ccommunity\u201d.)\n\nLet me be extremely clear. You do not need Webmentions to be part of the \u201cIndieWeb\u201d. The only real \u201crequirement\u201d, if you want to think of it that way, is to just have your own site on your own domain where you put your own stuff. That\u2019s it. How you make it look, what you put on there, what fancy IndieWeb.org \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d you decide to implement, doesn\u2019t make your site any more or less \u201cIndieWeb\u201d than any other.\n\nIndieweb.org is a great resource. But I fear that for as much good as it does, it can do equal harm. On the surface, Indieweb.org has a fantastic message.\n\nWhat is the IndieWeb? The IndieWeb is a people-focused alternative to the \u201ccorporate web\u201d. It is a community of independent and personal websites connected by open standards and based on the principles of: owning your domain and using it as your primary online identity, publishing > on your own site first (optionally elsewhere), and owning your content. Your content is yours When you post something on the web, it should belong to you, not a corporation. Too many companies have gone out of business and lost all of their users\u2019 data. By joining the IndieWeb, your content stays yours and in your control. You are better connected Your articles and status messages can be distributed to any platform, not just one, allowing you to engage with everyone. Replies and likes on other services can come back to your site so they\u2019re all in one place. You are in control You can post anything you want, in any format you want, with no one monitoring you. In addition, you share simple readable links such as example.com/ideas. These links are permanent and will always work.\n\nThe message is simple. The IndieWeb is about people. It\u2019s about owning your own domain and putting your stuff there. Great! But just below the surface, as you start to click on some of the links, IndieWeb.org begins to preach complexity. IndieAuth, Webmention, Micropub, WebSub, Microsub, building blocks, microformats, backfeeds, etc\u2026 These convolutions are niche, techno-aristocratic IndieWeb fever dreams which discourage and alienate those desperate to break from corporate web-silos and start anew on a simpler, more human web. Ignore them.\n\nA note on \u201ccommunity\u201d\u2026\n\nIf you are reading this, or you have a personal site, you are already part of it. Full stop. You don\u2019t need to be shy. You have things to say and people WANT to listen, they want to read, they want to connect. You don\u2019t have to be an \u201cinfluencer\u201d or have a big following. Your writing doesn\u2019t need to be AMAZING. You don\u2019t need to write to an audience. Write for yourself. Then share it. People will be interested I promise you. The #indieweb revival is here and you are 100% invited! Tell your friends.\n\nSo, hopefully this message can make it out to those who need to hear it\u2026\n\nYou want to be part of the IndieWeb? Be one of us? Get a domain. Put your site on it. Be yourself. Because the IndieWeb is about you.", "label": "non_personal"}

You can always start real simple and get more complex as you go. Time may be the biggest hurdle. I would just say that a blog isn\u2019t something you need to maintain or publish regularly.

{"title": "The adolescents are alright. So are the common people. Let\u2019s make tech good for them.", "url": "https://tommorris.org/posts/2025/the-adolescents-are-alright-so-are-the-common-people-lets-make-tech-good-for-them/", "content": "I\u2019ve been trying and failing to write about the current vibes of technology for the last few months, with a specific focus on both the wrapping up of the Post Office Horizon Inquiry, and the threat/promise by Keir Starmer to \u201cmainline AI in the veins\u201d of the United Kingdom. But that\u2019s way too big. I want to talk about aforementioned vibes based on two recent fictional depictions that directly touch on the societal role of technology. And because we\u2019re talking about vibes, I need to give two warnings. One is that it\u2019s just my opinion, man, and it will meander around a bit.\n\nAnd the second is a spoiler warning for both Adolescence and Black Mirror Series 7 Episode 1 (\u2018Common People\u2019).\n\nTo say Adolescence has become a touch point for popular concern about technology in the UK is an understatement. Each episode is a technically flawless one shot. The mini-series starts with a dramatic early morning arrest of a thirteen year old boy for murder of a classmate. The camera then follows the plodding institutional procedure of Jamie being booked into a police custody suite, having his fingerprints and samples taken, then an interview. It should be noted that the apparent commitment to procedural accuracy gets a bit shaky when it comes to the role of the defence solicitor, but given the number of disclosure violations in the criminal justice system of England and Wales, a few more occurring in fiction is at least in keeping with the show\u2019s commitment to brutal realism.\n\nThe subsequent episodes apply the same masterful theatre-like technique to the investigation of the crime by detectives at the unpleasant secondary school where both perpetrator and victim studied, then to a pre-trial interview by a psychologist in a youth detention centre, and finally to the consequences of the conviction on Jamie\u2019s family.\n\nGiven the centrality of technology to the crime at the heart of both the drama and the societal discussion it has spawned, it is weirdly absent from the masterly manoeuvred view of the camera. It reminds me of the depiction of HIV/AIDS on screen\u2014it is always there in the sense that it shapes the lives of those it affects, but you never see it, only the wretched physical effects it has on people infected, and the emotional consequences for their partners, friends and communities. Here, the smartphone, or the gaming console or PC, is the unseen horror, a malevolent ghost that is everywhere and nowhere. The inciting incident for the murder\u2014a series of interactions on Instagram\u2014are never seen, only discussed by others. The key to interpreting them is only grasped indirectly, when the detective\u2019s son Adam takes pity and gives his father a remedial education in translating semantically-overloaded emojis from impenetrable zoomer lingo into a motive that explains murder.\n\nThe Prime Minister incorrectly referring to Adolescence in Parliament as a \u201cdocumentary\u201d is perhaps a testament to the artful camerawork, but it is practically being treated as one\u2014with efforts to add it to the National Curriculum and legislate based on the assumption that screen time is not just rotting the brains of the young, it is turning them into murderers. Something. Must. Be. Done. Ban smartphones from the schools. Oh, what, headteachers can already do that? Well, double triple quadruple ban them! And ban the kids from social media too. Maybe we could pass some kind of Online Safety Bill to\u2026 oh, wait, we already have.\n\nLet\u2019s start with some concessions. There are bad consequences of technology. Obviously. But the nuance-free debate we\u2019ve seen since seems predicated on the idea that there is this giant immutable thing called Technology, and we can\u2019t do much about it. The most we can do is to save the Jamies and Lisas from the Satanic evils of Snapchat, Instagram and TikTok until they\u2019re old enough to make their own decisions. And once we\u2019ve returned to the pre-iPhone norm, order will be restored and childhood saved.\n\nThe framing around the government\u2019s AI policy is also worth noting here. The pressing need to \u201cmainline\u201d it into our national veins is roughly \u201cthis seems like it is inevitable, we at least want it to make some money and create some jobs\u201d, combined with a little dash of \u201cwe don\u2019t know what it is, but whatever it is, we want to beat China at it\u201d. The train is rolling, we either get on board and reap some economic and geostrategic benefits, or we don\u2019t. And we\u2019d rather reap some benefits than be stuck in the past, right? Stop with all the nuance. Get on board or die. (Silicon Valley accelerationism is basically a version of this view, but with a penchant for skull measuring, and an addiction to ketamine.)\n\nBoth the post-Adolescence moralism and the boosterish \u201cmainline AI into our veins\u201d narrative seem to coexist in the political imagination of Sir Keir Starmer, and both depend on a feeling that the result is inevitable and foreordained, and all we can do is react. We either accept it, and hope we can nudge it gently towards some social benefit, or bring down the regulatory banhammer.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable why people don\u2019t feel much control over technology. It\u2019s a fact they don\u2019t have much control. That\u2019s a problem we need to fix. The solution to that is imagining an alternative where they do. Let\u2019s imagine if technology was a tool that individuals could shape in accordance with their goals for a better life.\n\nA nuanced discussion of technology that doesn\u2019t fall into inevitabilism and moral panic might help us understand technology in a way where we can respond to it in intelligent and effective ways.\n\nAs an illustration, let\u2019s talk about Roblox. I have friends with young children who spend hours and hours every day playing Roblox on an iPad. When discussing Roblox, their chief concerns are \u201care they spending too much time on this thing?\u201d and \u201care they gonna end up talking to predators?\u201d\n\nThe easy answers you\u2019ll generally hear from the media: yes and yes.\n\nThe real answers to this are: that depends on a whole load of other variables and perhaps, but that risk very hard to quantify.\n\nAre there sexual predators on Roblox? Yes. This is because Roblox is a service on the internet, and there are sexual predators on the internet, in much the same way there are sexual and other predators everywhere. Are Roblox doing enough to combat predators on their platform? Maybe. Hard to tell. We may get more information as the new regulatory regime in the Online Safety Act takes shape, along with similar regulatory regimes in EU and Australia. Or we might not. But, absolutely, be vigilant against awful people, and don\u2019t assume the company will give a damn unless it reaches a point where it affects their stock price.\n\nAre children spending too much time on Roblox? Depends on the child, what they\u2019re getting from using the service, and what the opportunity cost there is. A lot of children and young people spend a lot of time playing computer games. So do adults. I\u2019ve spent a fair amount of time playing games. Some of them were crap, some of them were amazing. Kinda like books or albums or movies or meals in restaurants. Some of the people I knew at school likely spent time hanging around rural bus stations drinking bottles of White Lightning, a substance that\u2019s only charitably referred to as cider. Others took violin lessons and went to Oxford. (You can adjudicate which ones turned out happier and better adjusted.)\n\nSome of the kids I knew at school would have had colossally high levels of what is now called \u201cscreen time\u201d. Many also had colossally high levels of bullying. If you take the view that the time wandering around Roblox or watching weird algorithmically generated YouTube kids videos is time that said kids aren\u2019t spending playing with friends in wholesome ways, or taking ballet classes or composing sonnets, then, yes, your utilitarian calculus will swing heavily against it. But then you also need to weigh up the kids who are learning to build their own websites or video games, or finding supportive communities, or reading, or playing videos games with really strong narratives. And you need to add all the stuff in the plus column against all the absolutely bloody silly things kids got up to that did not need involve screens or internet connections. \u201cScreen time\u201d is a number, not an evaluation of whether the time spent was worthwhile in the context of their life.\n\nInto those conversations with parent friends about Roblox come the concessions: yes, it might be a waste of time. Yes, there might be Bad People on there, do keep an eye out for that. But, please, keep listening, it\u2019s also way worse than that. The whole enterprise of things like Roblox are built on pester power. Roblox makes absolute bank out of users convincing their parents to buy Robux to spend on random stuff in Roblox. That\u2019s how Roblox is very, very rich.\n\nLoads of other games do likewise too. Finding the games that don\u2019t suck is hard because our rating systems are based on a perception of risk that is centred around violence, profanity and nudity/sexual content. This is understandable: the video game rating system was basically cut and paste from the rating system used for films and television. But it isn\u2019t actually helpful to think about them in the same way as you do for film and television.\n\nAn illustration of this: Elden Ring is rated 16+ by PEGI, because it contains violence and gore and some nudity, apparently. (I haven\u2019t played it. I hear it is very good.) EA Sports FC \u201925 (formerly known as FIFA) is rated 3+ because it doesn\u2019t contain any violence or gore or nudity\u2014it\u2019s a football game, after all. It has an in-game currency, which is used to purchase randomised card packs. These are ways you give the game developer money in order to have a random chance to win something of benefit to you in the game\u2014namely, players. (So I\u2019m told. I also haven\u2019t played it.) If you don\u2019t win, you can pay lots of money to keep buying more and more card packs and opening them on the off-chance of getting the prize you want. That may sound like the sort of thing gambling addicts do with a fixed odds betting terminal. But you\u2019ll be glad to know it is not within the scope of the Gambling Act 2005 because that requires it be done \u201cfor a prize\u201d. A prize is defined as \u201cmoney or money\u2019s worth\u201d. And cards that give you the ability to add football players to your team aren\u2019t that. Other jurisdictions disagree, specifically Netherlands and Belgium.\n\nSure, there have always been ways for kids to waste their pocket money, from Panini stickers to Pogs to Pokemon cards. You used to have to slog your way down to your newsagent to waste your money on Panini football stickers. Now, PEGI, the Pan European Game Information service, who rate video games in the UK and Europe have decided that a game that pummels you with both the aesthetics of, and the mechanics of, gambling in order to win the chance of signing better players for your virtual football team deserves a 3+ \u201cSuitable for all ages\u201d ranking, with a little notice that reads:\n\nThis game offers players the opportunity to purchase in-game items, in the form of an in-game currency, which can be used to purchase random card packs and other game items. Some parents or carers may want to be aware of this. Parents, carers or other responsible adults should check to see what is being offered before making any purchase on behalf of a child. It should be noted that the game can still be played without the need to purchase such items.\n\nWhat is omitted from this description is that the game will usually really suck if you don\u2019t purchase said items, so you\u2019ll be constantly pressured to do so over and over.\n\nAnother example: let\u2019s talk about Balatro. It\u2019s an indie card-based computer game, and it is incredibly addictive. It is not a gambling game but it does rely on the scoring rules of poker hands. When PEGI first rated the game last year, they gave it an 18+ rating as it contained \u201cprominent gambling imagery\u201d. This is enough to classify it as 18+. EA Sports FC, which tries to get players to play what\u2019s essentially an I Can\u2019t Believe It\u2019s Not Gambling! slot machine to build their football team, is rated 3+. Balatro was reclassified on appeal as 10+, perhaps so PEGI could still retain some shred of professional dignity. Presumably, PEGI are still committed to the idea that EA Sports FC card packs are suitable for 3-9 year olds in a way that cartoon depictions of playing cards aren\u2019t.\n\nIt has now taken me boatloads of paragraphs to explain what sucks about lots of modern video games from AAA studios in a way someone who doesn\u2019t play video games can understand, and to give you examples of how the rating system designed by the industry and approved by regulators to protect children from harm does not actually do this very well. Humans are busy people and don\u2019t want to have to think about this. By contrast, \u201ctoo much screen time bad\u201d fits in a tweet or an opinion column. Guess which one takes off more in the public consciousness. And if you\u2019re a government, banning stuff costs nothing. (Except if you do it really badly. Which we have. More on that later. Let\u2019s get back to the really important stuff, namely television.)\n\nIf the technology in Adolescence takes the form of ghoulish off-screen actions that requires a secret Gen-Z emoji-to-English decoder ring to understand, the technology in \u2018Common People\u2019, the first episode of the new series of Black Mirror is as clear as day.\n\nAmanda is a teacher, and her British partner Mike is working in manual labour in Smalltown, USA. While in front of her class, Amanda collapses into a coma and suffers brain damage. There is no hope, says the doctor, except an experimental neurotech startup called Rivermind. In walks a kind saleswoman for the company. Installing the device would be free. The affected bit of the brain would be backed up to the cloud, and restored to the McGuffin every night while you sleep. The catch? it would be $300/month to pay for the subscription service. When the alternative is being dead, $300 is a bargain! OpenAI want $200 a month for the super duper version of ChatGPT after all.\n\nThe satire goes exactly where anyone who understands the arc of consumer tech would guess from the premise. Mike takes on extra shifts to help pay for the service keeping his partner alive, and ends up hustling for money on a website that\u2019s basically Twitch for sadistic humiliation. A premium tier is rolled out, and the basic tier is rapidly enshittified (technical term, don\u2019t blame me). Contextual adverts spew from Amanda\u2019s mouth at inopportune times (without her even being aware), which leads to her being almost fired after an advert for a shady Christian counselling service is unknowingly spewed directly at a pupil needing her support. Her \u201crest mode\u201d gets further extended, and her brain starts being used for some unstated purpose to benefit the Rivermind corporation, rather like a piece of malware mining cryptocurrency for someone else\u2019s benefit, except it\u2019s living in your own brain. (That\u2019s some real body horror.)\n\nI won\u2019t spoil the ending. It\u2019s as grim as you expect from Black Mirror.\n\nYes, it\u2019s Black Mirror, it\u2019s going to be over the top. Except, of course, the satire is real. People with \u201cobsolete\u201d bionic eyes that are no longer supported by the manufacturer are now losing their sight because\u2026 well, I\u2019d love for someone to justify this, because I sure as hell can\u2019t. There was once a time when restoring someone\u2019s sight got people to start spreading rumours about you being the messiah and fulfilling the prophecies foretold in the Book of Isaiah. Well, great news, we achieved a similar feat using technology. Then we cancelled the miracle that\u2019s sitting inside the eyelids of actual human beings when it conflicted with corporate intellectual property rights, and now they will go blind again.\n\nEvery time I think about the notion of the discontinued bionic eyes losing sight, I want to punch a wall. It\u2019s just so incredibly awful and in direct opposition to any humane version of how I envision technology working in society. We have the tech. It works. \u201cAI will fix it?\u201d Fuck right off, we\u2019ve already fixed it. And yet we haven\u2019t because of this? Absolutely ghoulish.\n\nThis episode of Black Mirror is not really about tech. Unlike some vibe-coded fantasy by a founder who doesn\u2019t want to pay software developers (or indeed, large chunks of what passes for enterprise software), the tech here actually does work. The culture around it doesn\u2019t. If you wanted to imagine a world where people have to engage in public displays of self-degradation on social media in order to pay for essential healthcare costs, well, type \u201cinsulin GoFundMe\u201d into a search engine. Researchers have written papers on the phenomena.\n\nThe McGuffin in this episode doesn\u2019t need fixing. The laws do. If someone sells you what the tech industry incorrectly refers to as a \u201cproduct\u201d, then fundamentally changes the terms in this manner\u2026 that ought to be an actionable consumer rights issue. Yes, even if in teeny tiny print on page 87 of the contract it says they can do that. But rebalancing consumer rights in an age of enshittified software-as-a-service is boring, involves tradeoffs, and might cost money. Take Smartphones Off Teenagers is super easy in comparison.\n\nThe point here is technology is not a magic box brought down from on high, it is a thing we create, and we collectively can decide how to regulate and shape it. We can just accept some Adolescence-style moral panic about ghostly black rectangles, decide we have no agency to meaningfully morph it to further the goals we want. We could do something, anything, because please won\u2019t someone think of the children. Or we could engage with it in a sensible but extremely critical way. If you want to be extremely critical, you\u2019ve got to understand it first.\n\nTechnologists\u2014the people who create, design and develop the technology\u2014are incredibly critical of technology.\n\nA little sample. Blockchain nonsense: absolutely crap, pretty much just scams. AI: yeah, in small, very well-tested domains it can be useful, but there\u2019s so much hype and nonsense, most of it pushed by politicians and business executives. Data security: Jesus, we\u2019re about a decade behind where we need to be. Those printers that want a subscription fee: yeah, throw that in the garbage and buy whatever the least awful laser printer is this year and use it until it dies.\n\nI frequently find myself explaining that there are viable alternatives to the exploitative treadmill of software-as-a-service subscription-based spyware. And yes, the barely functional AI nonsense they\u2019ve crowbarred into Office, Windows, iOS or WhatsApp is not there for your benefit. It is there because there\u2019s an AI investment bubble, and investors need to be convinced that Microsoft, Apple, Meta et al. have jumped on the hype train, even if it isn\u2019t actually going anywhere worth going.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to Roblox a second. Yes, yes, child predators, pester power, wait, virtual concentration camps. Oh god, do we have to?\n\nWhat does Roblox do right? It gives kids tools to make games. Wait, they don\u2019t call them games, they call them \u201cexperiences\u201d, probably because of App Store review rules or whatever. But you can make game-like things and share them with your friends. That\u2019s really cool.\n\nWe have a creation tool here that allows children to creatively use it to express themselves. That\u2019s good at least. Ah, but, I\u2019m sorry, there\u2019s bad stuff when you look a bit harder. Not the murdering-your-classmates genre of bad, but the boring nerdy regulatory kind of bad.\n\nIf you make a game on Roblox, the nice people at the Roblox Corporation pay you money if you do well in the form of Robux, which you can use to buy other stuff on Robux. When kids pester their parents to buy them Robux, the current exchange rate is \u00a34.99 for 500 Robux. You can buy them at a discount if you buy lots of them. The official exchange rate is 1 Robux = $0.0125 (\u00a30.009572 at time of writing).\n\nIf you accumulate lots of Robux because you\u2019ve made a successful \u201cexperience\u201d (i.e. game), you can cash out through a process called Developer Exchange, or DevEx. You can only do this when you\u2019ve earned 30,000 Robux. Great, so you get $375, right? Wrong! That\u2019s the rate at which you buy Robux. When you cash them out, you only get $0.0035 per Robux. Your 30,000 Robux turns into $105. You want to ask careful critical questions about technology? \u201cHow the hell isn\u2019t this exploitation of children?\u201d is the one that immediately comes to mind, followed quickly by \u201cthis is modern day company scrip, we banned that ages ago\u201d.\n\nTo learn more about the absolutely wild world of Roblox, go watch How Roblox Is Exploiting Young Game Developers from People Make Games.\n\nEvery new thing I learn about Roblox makes me genuinely infuriated. You\u2019ve made a platform to let children build things and express their creativity and ruined it with so much garbage. The wall needs punching so bad.\n\nIf a child wants to learn how to write, they need a pen, some paper, and an imagination. The latter is free, the former cost a few pounds at most. If a child wants to learn to make computer games, they should be afforded a way to do so without entering into an exploitative relationship with some massive corporation who will pay them in scrip and keep two thirds of their earnings. Maybe we could build something that gives them the ability to make stuff and learn. And the thing they create is theirs rather than something that Roblox has a hand in.\n\nOn a broader societal level: politicians could pass legislation that is better if they thought about technology in a more nuanced way. The harshest bits of the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act only affects the twenty biggest online platforms, for instance. (Roblox isn\u2019t one of them, curiously.) This is unlike the UK\u2019s Online Safety Act which sets no compliance threshold, and so affects basically everyone. Even the most spooked parent probably doesn\u2019t stay up at night worrying about some kind of Adolescence-style scenario playing out with their little Jamie on the London Fixed Gear and Single Speed forum, a place where cycling nerds discuss, well, fixed gear and single speed bikes. Thankfully, they won\u2019t be troubled by this risk. The faff of complying with the Online Safety Act has led the site administrators to close it down. Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon et al. will be able to shoulder whatever regulatory burden anyone puts on them. But the legislation passed ostensibly to stick it to Big Tech has led to lots of people running little hobbyist forums having to read long and incredibly boring Ofcom documents, and take on substantial personal legal risk for their hobby websites if they get it wrong. If you do care about fixed gear bikes, I guess you could find a Facebook group to talk to others about it. That\u2019d really stick it to Zuck.\n\nWhat we lose when the entire debate becomes about the notion of \u201cscreen time\u201d and ghostly Satanic rectangles is a dream of someting better. Technology could actually be good and not something that we just hate using. It feels weird to say this because so much of technology is just the product of unpleasant, lazy, cynical people who don\u2019t give a damn. (Or maybe they do, but the incentive structures doesn\u2019t really allow them. The output looks the same.) And non-technical people not only can understand it deeply rather than in reductive tabloid soundbitey chunks and moral panics , they can help build it carefully, deliberatively and in a way that brings out more humanity.\n\nHow you achieve this is a topic I defer to far smarter people, so I can go finish the rest of the new Black Mirror which has turned out to be rather better than I expected it would.", "label": "non_personal"}

{"title": "TIL: track changes in Emacs with highlight-changes-mode", "url": "https://tommorris.org/posts/2025/til-track-changes-in-emacs-with-highlight-changes-mode/", "content": "I find myself having to review and edit a lot of plain text. You\u2019d think a \u201cbicycle for the mind\u201d could make this better.\n\nNon-programmers have Word\u2019s Tracked Changes. Or the Google Docs equivalent. The point of this is if Person A wrote a document, and sent it to Person B for review, Person B could make a bunch of changes, then send it back to Person A.\n\nProgrammers, meanwhile, have tools that are\u2026 more sophisticated? Like diff for one. Both Vim and Emacs have much more sophisticated versions of undo/redo, and tooling like undo-fu because that complexity can be a lot. Plus we have version control systems like Git (or even fancier stuff like Jujutsu which I can\u2019t get on with). If you have the self-discipline and/or tooling to commit lots of little \u201cwip: refactored\u201d changes, you can then use rebase -i , cherry-pick and friends to stitch all those little scraps into a beautiful series of atomic commits that tell a lovely story for both your future self and others. Or git commit -am \"did stuff\" and embrace the chaos demon. But version control is perhaps over-the-top for drafting emails, blog posts and the like.\n\n(If you\u2019re vibe coding, feel free to disregard. Version control is completely optional, and it\u2019s way funnier not to use it.)\n\nIf you write lots of prose, you (or a hallucinating chatbot acting on your behalf) frequently cranks out a crappy first version, or a rough outline, and then you want to go through and polish it meticulously until it doesn\u2019t suck. When doing this, you want to make sure you\u2019ve properly edited everything. If you\u2019ve been noodling around in the intro, then get distracted and pootle around elsewhere, you might entirely skip doing anything about entire paragraphs. In the early days of word procesing, one often printed out the first draft, grabbed a red pen to review it methodically, then returned to the computer to make the edits. While doing this, you could obviously tick off each paragraph after you\u2019ve reviewed it. As previously noted, I see great merit in taking notes by hand, and so, yes, great if you can. But that means you have to use printers which are cursed. And it is a lot of faff, so you often can\u2019t.\n\nThe print-it-out-then-redline-it method is what Tracked Changes reimplements electronically, but Tracked Changes seems to have a baked-in assumption that the person doing the reviewing is separate from the person who wrote it. Which is often the case in a corporate environment\u2026 but often not the case. Also, I don\u2019t wanna use Word or Word clones because plain text is good.\n\nWhat I want then is a way to visually see \u201cwhat have I changed?\u201d as I\u2019m editing a document.\n\nEnter Emacs highlight-changes-mode .\n\nOpen a buffer in Emacs. Type M-x highlight-changes-mode . Start editing. The text you change will be highlighted. The text you don\u2019t change won\u2019t be. If you delete some text, the closest character will be marked with a delete symbol. By default, the changed text is coloured red, and the delete symbol is an underscore.\n\nIf you M-x highlight-changes-mode again, the change markers go away.\n\nI found the default red to be a bit over-the-top, and would rather have the change applied to the background rather than the text itself (also, avoids affecting syntax highlighting). I picked a colour that better matched my preferences and theme.\n\n(custom-set-faces! '(highlight-changes :foreground nil :background \"#004272\") '(highlight-changes-delete :underline t :foreground nil :background \"#004272\"))\n\nHighlight Changes mode does some other stuff too\u2014you can have it cycle through multiple colours, and distinguish between saved and unsaved changes. You can bounce around between bits of the text that you\u2019ve changed and bits you haven\u2019t. I\u2019m not sure I need that\u2026 yet. The EmacsWiki has some other fun stuff about how people have used highlight changes, along with some grumpiness about the choice of colours.", "label": "non_personal"}

In general the changes seem good, but there is one proposed change that is concerning: allowing townhomes instead of apartments or condos on some large sites that ought to be developed as densely as possible (link to packet). There is a great deal of community opposition to these upzones, so I sent in a supportive note to the Planning Commission in advance of their evening meeting.\n\nIn support of higher density at Michael\u2019s and Goodwill sites\n\nTo the Kirkland Planning Commission:\n\nI am writing in favor of proposed zoning amendments to the Michael\u2019s and Goodwill sites to allow higher density, taller building heights, and reduced parking requirements. These rare anchor sites offer great potential to make the neighborhood denser and more walkable.\n\nI do not support allowing townhomes in this area \u2014 along arterial routes with transit access, with many goods and services within walking or biking distance, we ought to support as much housing density as feasible. Kirkland and the greater Seattle area are in desperate need of more housing, so I urge you to use the code to require higher densities in the BC1 zone. If we do not push for higher density where it makes sense \u2014 and it makes a great deal of sense here \u2014 then the overall amount of additional housing Kirkland can accommodate will be much lower than the need. Please require a minimum density for ADUs in this area as in Alternatives 1 or 2 from Appendix 5.", "label": "non_personal"}
{"title": "Generative AI as a magic system \u2013 Tracy Durnell's Mind Garden", "url": "https://tracydurnell.com/2025/06/24/generative-ai-as-a-magic-system/", "content": "We treat generative AI like magic\u2026 and magic systems have rules. When creating fantasy worlds, writers think about who can use magic, how magic is performed, what it\u2019s able to do, what its constraints are, what the source of magic is, and what it costs. I\u2019m applying a bit of reverse worldbuilding to the real world to extrapolate the rules of the AI magic system.\n\nIslands in the Sky by Death Valley Girls\n\nWho can use AI magic: magic users pay to use corporate AI magic systems. Those who are wealthy and tech savvy enough can host their own local model. Free magic use is mostly limited to corporate largesse ultimately intended to build magic dependency.\n\nHow AI magic is cast: AI spells are cast with written text input through a digital interface. Spells are refined and recast until the outcome satisfies (spells produce different results every time they are cast).\n\nWhat AI magic can do: AI spells can produce combinations of words that are interpreted as writing, code-like material that sometimes runs as code, images that resemble art, and video that resembles reality. It can create imitations of specific human creators\u2019 work, as well as individual\u2019s speech and appearance. It can also mimic human conversation for a span of time before the spell dissipates. AI magic is near instantaneous, allowing people without technical skills to produce text and graphics faster than writers and artisans.\n\nWhat AI magic cannot do: AI magic cannot produce the same outcome twice, nor act upon existing conjurations, instead casting spells anew each time. AI magic itself cannot reference sources, though may be used in tandem with other tools that enable citation (though with questionable accuracy). AI magic cannot reason or write, but its conjurations may create the illusion of intelligence through their statistical consistency with written language use.\n\nThe source of AI magic: AI magic derives from statistical analysis of human-created art, writing, speech, music, and video, classified and sorted by human laborers in low-cost geos.\n\nThe cost of AI magic: Resource costs of AI magic include power, water, and high-end chips, which themselves require specialized manufacturing and rare earth minerals.\n\nSocial costs include the reinforcement of racism and sexism, as well as mental harm to AI trainers assessing inputs to the magic system.\n\nSocietal costs include job elimination and job intensification as positions able to be reproduced in part by magic are eliminated and that magic work is shifted to the remaining workers.\n\nInformation costs include the destruction of the online publishing incentive structure / information commons, leading to more paywalled content; an increase in low-quality material, which makes finding accurate information harder; as well as the danger of political propaganda by poisoned magic systems.\n\nIndividual user costs include critical thinking skills, writing abilities, and patience for conversing with humans.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nThe new magic of AI vs. the old magic of artists by Kening Zhu\n\nSee also:\n\nGenerative AI and the Business Borg aesthetic", "label": "non_personal"}
{"title": "Copyright anti-circumvention: an AI hypothetical", "url": "https://tommorris.org/posts/2024/copyright-anti-circumvention-ai-hypothetical/", "content": "Imagine there is an American company called FancySiri Inc. who make a commercially available large language model similar to those offered by Google, OpenAI, Anthropic etc. It provides a chatbot service similar to ChatGPT, Gemini, et al. where users can ask questions and get a load of synthetic text of dubious provenance and accuracy that purports to answer the question they asked.\n\nNow imagine there is a person, let\u2019s call him Keith Jones. Keith is a British citizen and runs a website hosted in the UK. Every page on his website is marked with \u201cCopyright \u00a9 2024 Keith Jones. All rights reserved.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Keith places Schema.org metadata in the page, in a manner broadly as follows:\n\n<body vocab=\"https://schema.org/\" typeof=\"WebPage\"> ... <footer> <span property=\"copyrightNotice\"> Copyright \u00a9 <span property=\"copyrightYear\">2024</span> <span property=\"copyrightHolder\" typeof=\"Person\"> <span property=\"name\">Keith Jones</span> </span>. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_rights_reserved\" property=\"license\">All rights reserved.</a> </span> </footer> </body>\n\n(Other metadata standards are available: microformats, DC terms etc. Pick whichever one you hate least.)\n\nKeith is not particularly impressed with the trend towards artificial intelligence, so he obtains a list of the User Agents of commercially available large language models that happens to include well-known existing services already mentioned and our hypothetical FancySiri Inc. (ai.robots.txt or similar lists on the web)\n\nKeith puts up a robots.txt file and implements filtering based on User Agent string matching to always return an HTTP 401 Unauthorized response to known AI/LLM scrapers including FancySiri. This denies them access to his beautifully curated collection of tasteful cat pictures and discussions of the nerdiest of minutiae concerning programming in Rust.\n\nFancySiri Inc. have published on their website\u2019s legal FAQ that they comply with robots.txt and only scrape material using the User-Agent specified, \u201cFancySiriBot\u201d.\n\nUnfortunately, they lied.\n\nEither they did not respect the contents of Keith\u2019s robots.txt, or they ran a second scraper that uses the User Agent string of a human-operated web browser. Like, say \u201cMozilla/5.0 (iPhone14,3; U; CPU iPhone OS 15_0 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/602.1.50 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/10.0 Mobile/19A346 Safari/602.1\u201d (for those not familiar with reading User Agent strings, this UA is for an iPhone 13 Pro Max running iOS 15).\n\nA tech company lying? Shocking, I know.\n\nKeith learns that a blog post he published about some particularly abstruse Rust minutiae has become part of the training data used for FancySiri\u2019s large language model. For instance, when the FancySiri chatbot is asked about the rather niche topic, the server returns words that are so remarkably close to Keith\u2019s blog post that it\u2019s beyond any doubt where it came from.\n\nKeith is rather puzzled about this and takes a break from photographing his cat and writing Rust to peruse the UK\u2019s Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988. After some consideration, he has some interesting questions. Purely hypothetically, one must note. He does not have the money to take FancySiri Inc. to court, and has a wise policy of avoiding civil litigation on the very reasonable basis that he enjoys not being sad all the time.\n\nDoes the publication of a robots.txt file and the use of a User-Agent matching traffic block amount to an effective technological protection measure as defined by s296ZF of the CDPA? Assuming the answer to (1) is yes, has FancySiri Inc. circumvented those measures knowing, or with reasonable grounds, to know that they are trying to circumvent it? That is to say, have they breached s296ZA of the CDPA? Is the machine readable metadata on Keith\u2019s webpage \u201crights management information\u201d under the definition given in s296ZG(7)(b)? If the answer to (4) is yes, has FancySiri Inc. \u201cremoved or altered\u201d the rights management information from Keith\u2019s website? If the answer to (5) is yes, are there reasons on which a court could reasonably conclude that FancySiri Inc. did so \u201cknowingly and without authority\u201d while knowing or having reason to believe that by doing so they are inducing, enabling, facilitating, or concealing an infringement of copyright (per s296ZG)?\n\nIf you\u2019re a nerd, feel free to re-run this exercise with the particular anti-circumvention rules as implemented in your preferred jurisdiction. They\u2019re all fairly similar because large chunks of copyright law is the product of international agreements (in this case, the 1996 WIPO Copyright Treaty).\n\nThe rough intuition behind this hypothetical is as follows: anti-circumvention rules are really strong. The domain of things which they protect has expanded way beyond the original purpose (computer software and other creative works including music, books, movies, visual arts etc.) to afford copyright protection to the DRM on ink cartridges, tractors and ventilators (the latter being a particularly unpleasant illustration of the prioritisation of corporate greed over human life during the COVID pandemic). Such a broad legal rule could also potentially allow a suitably placed claimant to challenge\u2014at least, in theory\u2014the use of online materials by AI companies.\n\nThe UK government are currently consulting on Copyright and Artificial Intelligence, though they seem to have not mentioned the application of anti-circumvention rules (either in the consultation document or the summary assessment of options document). Some of the questions the government are consulting on\u2014specifically about machine-readable methods for \u201creserving rights\u201d\u2014would seem to envision a regime where one has to take specific technical steps to protect works from infringement. Hence they kind of run in parallel to the anti-circumvention rules already in the CDPA and similar instruments. It might be sensible to ensure they don\u2019t conflict, or cause confusion.\n\nIf the government wish to amend the copyright laws to broaden the current limited data mining exception to cover AI training, that policy goal could be undermined by the use of anti-circumvention rules against the same AI companies they seek to, uh, liberate. That said, under the principle of \u201cwhat\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander\u201d, perhaps Keith should be afforded the same maximalist level of protection of the intellectual property in his cat pictures and blog posts about Rust programming as companies like HP and Lexmark have greatly benefitted from when it comes to stopping people using \u201cpirate ink\u201d in their inkjet printers.\n\nAppendix: relevant CDPA passages\n\nThe relevant passages of the legislation are included below for interested readers. For those who enjoy reading legislation, the whole text is on legislation.gov.uk for your perusal. I have tried to chop out as much that isn\u2019t relevant as humanly possible.\n\nOne thing to note is that s296 deals with anti-circumvention of computer software while s296ZA-ZF deal with anti-circumvention as applied to everything else. Since the problem concerns a blog post (which might contain incidental bits of computer code in trivial quantities), I\u2019ve used the non-code sections. If the hypothetical concerned, say, a self-hosted Gitea instance containing a bunch of code, the s296 code version would apply instead.\n\nSection 296ZA: Circumvention of technological measures\n\n(1) This section applies where\u2014 (a) effective technological measures have been applied to a copyright work other than a computer program; and (b) a person (B) does anything which circumvents those measures knowing, or with reasonable grounds to know, that he is pursuing that objective.\n\n(Subsection (2) omitted - it deals with cryptographic research, which isn\u2019t going on here.)\n\n(3) The following persons have the same rights against B as a copyright owner has in respect of an infringement of copyright\u2014 (a) a person\u2014 (i) issuing to the public copies of, or (ii) communicating to the public, the work to which effective technological measures have been applied; and (b) the copyright owner or his exclusive licensee, if he is not the person specified in paragraph (a).\n\nThe remaining subsections are omitted: (4) deals with concurrent rights, (5) deals with procedural and evidential matters, while (6) and (7) concern rights in performance, publication rights, an database rights - all of which are not dealt with in the hypothetical.\n\nSection 296ZF: Interpretation of sections 296ZA to 295ZEA\n\n(1) In sections 296ZA to 296ZE, \u201ctechnological measures\u201d are any technology, device or component which is designed, in the normal course of its operation, to protect a copyright work other than a computer program. (2) Such measures are \u201ceffective\u201d if the use of the work is controlled by the copyright owner through\u2014 (a) an access control or protection process such as encryption, scrambling or other transformation of the work, or (b) a copy control mechanism, which achieves the intended protection. (3) In this section, the reference to\u2014 (a) protection of a work is to the prevention or restriction of acts that are not authorised by the copyright owner of that work and are restricted by copyright; and (b) use of a work does not extend to any use of the work that is outside the scope of the acts restricted by copyright. (4) Expressions used in sections 296ZA to 296ZEA which are defined for the purposes of Part 1 of this Act (copyright) have the same meaning as in that Part.\n\nSection 296ZG: Electronic rights management information\n\n(1) This section applies where a person (D), knowingly and without authority, removes or alters electronic rights management information which\u2014 (a) is associated with a copy of a copyright work, or (b) appears in connection with the communication to the public of a copyright work, and where D knows, or has reason to believe, that by so doing he is inducing, enabling, facilitating or concealing an infringement of copyright.\n\nSubsection (2) concerns importing and is not relevant.\n\n(3) A person issuing to the public copies of, or communicating, the work to the public, has the same rights against D and E as a copyright owner has in respect of an infringement of copyright. (4) The copyright owner or his exclusive licensee, if he is not the person issuing to the public copies of, or communicating, the work to the public, also has the same rights against D and E as he has in respect of an infringement of copyright.

It\u2019s a sharecropping system, but the sharecroppers are generally happy because their interest lies in self-expression or socializing, not in making money, and, besides, the economic value of each of their individual contributions is trivial. It\u2019s only by aggregating those contributions on a massive scale \u2013 on a web scale \u2013 that the business becomes lucrative. To put it a different way, the sharecroppers operate happily in an attention economy while their overseers operate happily in a cash economy.\n\nI encountered this (old) analogy for social media platforms as digital sharecropping and thought it also fit generative AI. Generative AI companies steal our intellectual property then license it back to us. We can\u2019t be compensated reasonably for our individual contributions to the model because they\u2019ve stolen from so many of us and each individual\u2019s work represents a miniscule portion of the entire model. Whatever we generate with their models can\u2019t be copyrighted and used to make money for *us* without significant human contributions \u2014 but generated works are in direct competition with the creators whose works built the model. These powerful, well-funded companies want businesses to fire their employees and pay them instead, making businesses reliant on an opaque, unpredictable service that demands vast amounts of natural resources that may be in short \u2014 and shortening \u2014 supply.\n\nBut unlike social media, which rewards users emotionally rather than financially for their labor, creators aren\u2019t getting anything out of having our work used to train generative AI models. And so we\u2019re fighting back earlier in the cycle than with social media \u2014 maybe before it can become entrenched. AI evangelists speak as if the technology\u2019s supremacy is inevitable, but that\u2019s propaganda to get us to shut up and hand over our creations and our jobs.\n\nRecent AI shenanigans in the news:\n\nChatGPT caught giving horrible advice to cancer patients by Sharon Adarlo (Neoscope)\n\nWhy Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest AI developers are hiring poets by Andrew Deck (rest of world)\n\nIowa Is Using ChatGPT to Take Out Banned Books by Alejandra Gularte (Vulture)\n\nGenerative AI at work", "label": "non_personal"}

Stowing your carry-on wasn\u2019t a competitive sport back in the day.).\n\nThe aesthetics of generative AI\n\n\u201cI have become momentarily obsessed with scrolling down the homepage of the MetaAI tool and seeing the infinite feed of what people have been asking of The Machine. The outputs are horribly banal, but the requests are a weird window into THE (NORMIE) HUMAN SOUL AND ITS DESIRES: www.meta.ai\u201d\n\n\u2014 Matt Muir, May 6, 2025 at 8:51 AM\n\n(via)\n\nBy its nature, generative AI produces the most likely image that meets the brief, which devolves to insipid Pictionary-style visual communication: chonky = cat, kebab = food = French chef\u2019s hat. These graphics are iconographic pablum, the uninspired result of gee-whiz curiosity about a new \u201ctool\u201d (toy)(trap) in an environment that discourages personal taste and cultural literacy.\n\nOriginally, I wrote up why I find these particular graphics tacky and visually uninteresting, but realized that ultimately, what they look like doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 it\u2019s the beliefs beneath the appearance that matter. As corporate models are trained further, Generative AI will probably continue to get better, rendering more attractive and/or plausible outputs, but it won\u2019t matter to me how good it gets because I reject the values it represents.\n\n(NB: I don\u2019t want you to feel bad about yourself if you use generative AI, because there are myriad reasons to have experimented with it, including being forced to for your employment; I want you to recognize what it symbolizes when you enthusiastically use this technology today, and make an informed choice about whether those are values you wish to signal to others.)\n\n\u201cWhat is wrong with a counterfeit is not what it is like, but how it was made.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Harry G. Frankfurt, On Bullshit\n\nAesthetics are looks that signal values\n\nWitching Hour by Ladytron\n\nAn aesthetic is an expression of taste for shared values, commonly communicated through a distinct style. We think of aesthetics as surface appearance only, but the formation of an aesthetic\u2019s conventions reflects the why and the how underneath the what. Just as the medium of a thing carries a message, so does its aesthetic. Aesthetics are visually and verbally encoded value systems.\n\nIdeology is a value system, independent of appearances. Aesthetics are the appearance of an ideology, which grow from its values. Subcultures form around ideologies, with members signaling their participation through aesthetics. \u201cGood taste\u201d is aesthetics that express those values.\n\nThough it\u2019s now often reduced to a visual style, the Arts and Crafts movement of the late 1800s and early 1900s was cross-disciplinary and united instead by an ethos \u2014 namely, the nobility of craftsmanship*:\n\n\u201cFor it is not the material, but the absence of human labor, which makes the thing worthless, and a piece of terracotta, or plaster of paris, which has been wrought by the human hand, is worth all the stone and Carrara cut by machinery.\u201d \u2014 John Ruskin, The Lamp of Truth from The Seven Lamps of Architecture\n\nAccording to the Arts and Crafts aesthetic, what is made should signal how it is made \u2014 the aesthetic\u2019s value system weights how something is made to be as important, if not more, as what is made. Surface appearance is borne of the decisions this taste for craft produces.\n\n*(People might instead think of this William Morris quote as the quintessential perspective of Arts and Crafts \u2014 \u201cHave nothing in your house that you do not know to be useful, or believe to be beautiful.\u201d \u2014 and I suspect there\u2019s a reason we\u2019ve been taught to recall a philosophy centered on material possession instead of labor.)\n\nLooking at a Kelmscott Press book (William Morris\u2019 printing company) reveals the printer\u2019s respect for handicraft: they designed custom drop letters and frames, included original illustrations by fine artists like Edward Burne-Jones, used original type modeled after typefaces used by printers like Aldus Manutius in the early days of the printing press, printed with a richer black ink than was standard at the time, and employed a heavy hand in letterpress printing so the design and type would be impressed into the page. Thoughtful, intentional ornamentation is embraced. The artifact itself is a thing to be appreciated as much as its contents; these are books that honor the integrity of all creative workers involved in their production.\n\nEmily Amick applies this analytical lens to reveal the tradwife aesthetic\u2019s underlying values:\n\nPrairie-core. Domestic bliss. Big sleeves. Bigger sourdough starters. And beneath it all, the subtle (or not-so-subtle) message: a woman\u2019s place is in the kitchen. But not because she wants to be there, because that\u2019s where God or her husband or some TikTok algorithm put her. The tradwife aesthetic promises comfort, but it delivers control. It\u2019s softness as a strategy. It\u2019s anti-feminism with a floral filter. It\u2019s nostalgia for a time when women were property, romanticized by influencers who want brand deals from butter. [\u2026] The tradwife says: give up your autonomy and someone else will take care of everything.\n\nWe adopt aesthetics based on aspirational values\n\nJessica Cullen writes that (emphasis mine): \u201cAesthetics aren\u2019t always about who we currently are but rather who we want to be.\u201d People adopt an aesthetic to say something about themselves to others. We intentionally adopt a particular subculture\u2019s aesthetics to convey our belonging and raise our status within the subculture. As Alec Leach puts it, \u201ca lot of the modern taste economy is actually the status economy.\u201d\n\nSometimes, we perceive only the surface level of an aesthetic, its appearance without the values \u2014 as Amick notes, the tradwife aesthetic \u201clooks so damn pretty and nourishing. And we are tired.\u201d \u2014 but whenever we adopt an aesthetic, we endorse (intentionally or not) the underlying values it represents. Amick continues dissecting the tradwife aesthetic and how it serves as conservative propaganda:\n\nWhat looks like innocent lifestyle content is actually part of an organized political movement designed to make patriarchy look cozy and appealing. Because politics is downstream from culture. The vibes that influence how we act and live.\n\nAesthetics matter more than ever because we act in accordance with our chosen aesthetics. As we get more and more of our \u201ccultural\u201d content on corporate silos, politics and purchases have subsumed a lot of cultural tastemaking. In this TikTok, Jamelle Bouie describes how politicians use aesthetic signaling to appeal to voters. Richard Sennett identifies that politicians come to embody \u201cintentions, desires, values, beliefs, tastes \u2013 an emphasis which has again the effect of divorcing power from responsibility.\u201d\n\nAnu Atluru argues that \u201cAesthetics are the modern units of cultural currency\u2014stores of value and instruments of power, capable of appreciating and being monetized at scale. Owning an aesthetic is owning influence.\u201d (emphasis mine)\n\nInterrogating the Business Borg aesthetic\n\nGlass Lux by Glass Lux\n\nThe Arts and Craft movement\u2019s respect for labor inspired stylistic choices that highlighted craftwork as well as the decisions in what goods to produce and how. So how does the Business Borg aesthetic reveal its values?\n\nTo define the Business Borg aesthetic, I\u2019m looking at:\n\nthe values I see expressed through generative media,\n\nI see expressed through generative media, the actions of the corporations behind generative AI,\n\nof the corporations behind generative AI, who buys into generative AI, and\n\nbuys into generative AI, and what else they like that reflects the same underlying values.\n\nWhat genAI is better at than a human artist is being cheap and instant.\n\nThe Business Borg aesthetic uses technology to signal wealth and power. Generative AI is not the only visual expression of the Business Borg aesthetic, just its most recognizable. The aesthetic is also signified visually by CGI-heavy blockbuster franchises, NFT art, and the Cybertruck; and in text by LinkedIn corporate thirst traps, X braggadocio, SEO word vomit, and generated \u201canswers\u201d to search results.\n\nAs political bedpartners, there is overlap between the Business Borg aesthetic and the MAGA aesthetic, but they\u2019re distinct viewpoints. Both share dominance as a core value, decry empathy, center patriarchy, and admire performance \u2014 but MAGA also signals Judeo-Christian morality, traditional beauty standards / traditional gender roles, hyper masculinity / violence, and nationalism. MAGA borrows aesthetics from golden pasts, like Neo-Classical architecture, tradwives, and, as Kate Wagner brands it, Regional Car Dealership Rococo; Business Borg prefer the more modern tones of cyberpunk, solarpunk, and minimalism. Business Borg are regulatory libertarians who envision themselves as the rightful leaders of society, Kings of techno-city-states; MAGA are Christian nationalists who want to use the power of the state to impose their beliefs on others.\n\nElon is a Business Borg at heart but wielded a chainsaw to appeal to the more violent MAGA aesthetic. Zuckerberg is a Business Borg but got a MAGA makeover with masculine stubble and bling.\n\nWhy am I naming this after the Borg? Like Star Trek\u2019s Borg, this is an aesthetic rooted in extractive consumption, assimilationist dominance, neo-colonial expansionism, self-righteous conviction, reductionist thinking, and proclamations of inevitability. It idolizes technology, often inspired by older science-fiction, and draws on cyberpunk aesthetics. The Silicon Valley Collective values groupthink and believes themselves superior to \u201cthe other.\u201d\n\nWho embraces this aesthetic\n\nNot all users of Generative AI embrace the Business Borg aesthetic. I think a lot of people are experimenting with generative AI out of neophilic curiosity, productivity imperatives, nihilistic determinism, and corporate fiat. Aspiring billionaires adopt the Business Borg aesthetic to signal their belonging in the cohort of the techno-rich.\n\nGenAI evangelists seem to be the same type of person who was into passive income and supplements fifteen years ago, then Soylent and SEO ten years ago, then NFTs and macro diets five years ago, now genAI and X blue checks.\n\nThe Business Borg aesthetic combines tech-centered neophilia, a hustle mindset, an obsession with optimization, evangelical fervor, and fake-it-till-you-make-it showmanship.\n\nThe Elon fanclub are Business Borg. Ed Zitron\u2019s Business Idiot shares a lot of characteristics with Business Borg (and may even be the same group, but I think feels a little different?).\n\nThe subculture emphasizes high profile demonstrations of \u201cwinning\u201c \u2014 using a $10k NFT as their X profile pic, bragging about SEO heists ripping off a competitor, generosity stunts a la Mr Beast, rubbing it in Miyazaki\u2019s face that there will be thousands of shitty knockoffs vaguely reminiscent of his work across the web.\n\nBusiness Borg signal their busyness \u2014 and importance \u2014 by broadcasting how little they sleep, how much they work, and how little they read. The only fiction they like is (old) sci-fi because they read it as non-fiction, not fiction \u2014 a source of \u201cinspiration\u201d stripped of context and commentary. Using GenAI signals their adoption of cutting edge technology, the synthetic smoothness emphasizing its nonhuman origin. They care a lot about IQ, a supposedly impartial measure of intelligence that rewards their backgrounds and thinking styles, and idolize \u201cgenius.\u201d They\u2019re not actually neurodivergent, but play on stereotypes of autistic savants to cover for their pathological greed and lack of empathy.\n\nTheir visual and linguistic taste is mid because taste is not valued in the Business Borg aesthetic. In fact, there\u2019s a certain pride in prompting things without having any skill, an almost gleeful snub to the perceived cultural gatekeepers \u2014 artists and writers and other creative workers \u2014 whose opinions the Business Borg disrespect because they believe that authority derives from money, not knowledge. They believe artists have wasted their time learning skills and developing taste. Academics have wasted their time studying things when information is just a click away. Business Borg don\u2019t care about anything besides making money, and don\u2019t care much how they spend it because the point is to have it, and show off that they have it.\n\nInto The Water by Ritual Howls\n\nGenAI True Believers often resemble the CEOs at the head of tech companies: wealthy, male, and white. These are also the people who are least at threat from the widespread use of generative AI, which reinforces racial and gender stereotypes and purports neutrality while serving up right-wing biases and corporate and foreign propaganda. Audrey Watters points out:\n\n\u201cComputing (in general and ed-tech specifically) has long been the bastion of white male privilege; and while there had been efforts to change that \u2013 in pipelines and on panels and whatnot \u2013 AI is clearly a re-entrenchment of that power, explicitly so with the Trump Administration\u2019s dismantling of civil rights protections, echoed by the tech industry\u2019s dismantling of its own DEI initiatives.\u201d\n\nAnil Dash describes \u201cAI-first\u201d as this year\u2019s \u201cReturn to Office.\u201d Managers didn\u2019t care about in-office culture until it was made clear that workers could carry on just fine without them; managers care about AI only insomuch as it permits controlling \u2014 and firing \u2014 workers.\n\nWhat the Business Borg aesthetic represents is more important than its appearance; it represents the dominance of ordinal thinking and the ability of moneyed power to do as it wishes without regard to law or morality \u2014 in short, the hierarchical worldview that some people are better than others and that their preferences trump their lesser\u2019s needs.\n\n\u201cWe will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own. Your culture will adapt to service us. Resistance is futile.\u201d \u2014 the Borg\n\nValues driving the Business Borg aesthetic\n\nTeri Kanefield breaks down Leor Zmigrod\u2019s book on ideology, explaining that \u201cAll ideologies seek a utopia.\u201d The Business Borg utopia puts billionaires and their ilk high atop society, in control via the technology they own.\n\nCore values I see uniting the Business Borg aesthetic are:\n\nonly the output matters efficiency is king quantity over quality appearance trumps reality \u201cprogress\u201d cannot be stopped\n\nValue: Only the output matters\n\nGenerative AI is being marketed to businesses as a low-cost replacement for workers that cuts steps \u2014 and collaboration \u2014 out of the process. This is a box-checking culture; all that matters is that an email was sent, a presentation was created, the newspaper had a summer reading insert, no matter the books on it were imaginary.\n\nFoundational beliefs\n\nprocess does not add value and wastes time\n\nthe world is reducible to data , and every question has one objectively correct answer\n\n, and every question has communication and collaboration are a waste of time (\u201cemail jobs\u201d)\n\n(\u201cemail jobs\u201d) experience is irrelevant\n\nOutcome: Tech reduces the complex to input and output\n\nIn contrast with the Arts and Crafts movement, the Business Borg aesthetic actively conceals human labor and venerates the wisdom of the machine. Generative text and graphics simulate a performance of human-less \u2014 cost-less \u2014 automation. Generative answers encourage a reliance on the machine to synthesize on one\u2019s behalf \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t matter to search engines that the \u201canswers\u201d their AI has provided cite sources incorrectly.\n\nHumans are perceived as sources of inefficiency under the Business Borg ideology, because they must be compensated in accordance with their skills and how much time they spend working. Generating material is rooted in devaluing both skill and process. The invented summer reading list was the result of forcing a single contractor to prepare an impossible quantity of work; generating content was the only way for the poor bloke to produce the content on budget. No one reviewed it, because Business Borg only care that the product exists.\n\nEd Zitron describes the evolution of the Business Idiot, personified by middle managers who are completely dissociated from the product they\u2019re selling and explicitly do not do work (emphasis mine):\n\n[Business Idiots] see every part of our lives as a series of inputs and outputs. They boast about how many books they\u2019ve read rather than the content of said books, about how many hours they work (even though they never, ever work that many), about high level they are in a video game they clearly don\u2019t play, about the money they\u2019ve raised and the scale they\u2019ve raised it at, and about how expensive and fancy their kitchen gadgets are. Everything is dominance, acquisition, growth and possession over any lived experience, because their world is one where the journey doesn\u2019t matter, because their journeys are riddled with privilege and the persecution of others in the pursuit of success. These people don\u2019t want to automate work, they want to automate existence. They fantasize about hitting a button and something happening, because experiencing \u2014 living! \u2014 is beneath them, or at least your lives and your wants and your joy are.\n\nValue: Efficiency is king\n\nGenerative AI produces endless content for low cost. Corporations are using Generative AI as an excuse to lay off workers and intensify the jobs of those remaining.\n\nReady Aim Fire (Owl Vision Remix) [Single] by Blue Stahli\n\nFoundational beliefs\n\nthe more mechanized a process is, the more efficient it becomes because humans are naturally inefficient\n\nOutcome: GenAI performs \u201cefficiency\u201d\n\nGenerative AI need not actually reduce work or cost to represent efficiency when mechanization is always favored over people. The Business Borg aesthetic perceives automation as efficient \u2014 hence situations where workers are paid to simulate chatbots simulating human agents on customer service platforms, Microsoft devs handhold Copilot, and GM\u2019s Cruise \u201cautonomous\u201d taxis needed remote human intervention every 4-5 miles!!!\n\nEfficiency is a code word for shareholders, just like \u201ccost-cutting,\u201d who know that these phrases mean putting the boot on workers\u2019 necks for short-term profits. This efficiency aesthetic is used to justify outrageously profitable companies continuing to slash workers *cough Microsoft* It plays out as Hollywood demolishing the screenwriter profession to save a buck on writing rooms and self-cannibalizing the development of future acting talent by forcing extras to be body scanned so they can be reproduced by AI.\n\nJeremy comments on the use of genAI in coding, noting that it\u2019s justified by claims like \u201cworking code wins\u201d \u2014 as in, what it looks like under the hood and how it\u2019s constructed don\u2019t matter. I\u2019m not a coder, but I\u2019ve seen enough HTML produced by PageMaker and other CMSs to be skeptical of the quality of any generated code \u2014 is genAI producing the coding equivalent of tables for web layout? \ud83e\udd14 The Business Borg aesthetic accepts mediocrity without understanding; easy and fast is always best. Good enough is always good enough.\n\nValue: Quantity over quality\n\nGenerative AI is billed as a good-enough tool that will speed up production. Cory Doctorow writes of the managerial push to automate with AI:\n\nThe point of using automation to weaken labor isn\u2019t just cheaper products \u2013 it\u2019s cheaper, defective products, inflicted on the unsuspecting and defenseless public who are no longer protected by workers\u2019 professionalism and pride in their jobs.\n\nEnormous by LLgL TNDR\n\nFoundational beliefs\n\nprofit today trumps tomorrow\u2019s concerns \u2014 someone else will have to fix \u2018that problem\u2019\n\n\u2014 someone else will have to fix \u2018that problem\u2019 money is authority \u2014 individual rankings can be quantified by wealth\n\n\u2014 individual rankings can be quantified by wealth anything that cannot be quantified is not important\n\nOutcome: Algorithms produce culture-like media, not culture\n\nGenAI and corporate web algorithms are intended to absorb attention like black absorbs light; they are designed to maximize engagement at minimal cost. Spotify benefits from degradation of culture. Netflix is a chum machine, built to spew content that people watch in the background. Kyle Raymond Fitzpatrick laments that \u201cSo much of culture is edgeless and soft, intended for us to astroglide through it without any friction or doubt as we half-watch in 1.5x speed, to consume as if we really are incapable of critical thoughts, all to appeal to everyone and no one at the same time.\u201d Internet Age capitalism produces entertainment that is culture-like, writes Nicholas Carr:\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really being tested here is human taste. Will we accept a simulacrum of a work of art or craft as a satisfactory substitute for the real thing?\u201d\n\nSo long as people accept cheap low-quality cultural media, businesses have little incentive to pay for higher quality. Generative AI becomes an attack on culture because it drowns out human-made art and writing so it\u2019s impossible to find amidst the Great Social Media Garbage Patch. Aidan Walker describes all this as \u2018 slop capitalism \u2018: \u201can economic and cultural system in which the primary product is slop and the primary activity is the destruction of value rather than its creation.\u201d\n\nValue: Appearances trump reality\n\nGenerative AI produces plausible graphics that we interpret as real-adjacent and plausible combinations of text that we interpret as communication.\n\nFoundational Beliefs\n\nperformance of dominance builds and reinforces real power\n\nOutcome: GenAI supersedes reality with performance and symbolism\n\nThe Business Borg aesthetic celebrates audacious performances of infinite wealth and indefinite power: adopters and evangelists for genAI also embrace filling streets with \u201cself-driving\u201d cars over the protests of residents and first responders, raining space debris onto inhabited areas from slapdash rocket ships, paying a fortune for a banana taped to a wall as conceptual art and eating it, paying women to have their IVF babies so they can seem fertile without fucking. While the culture at large has shifted towards inconspicuous consumption, luxury that requires knowledge to see, Business Borg signal their wealth blatantly.\n\nA repeating theme of the Business Borg aesthetic is replacing reality with life-like hyperreality: the simulation of conversation and connection with chatbots, the renderings of war and disaster mimicking photojournalism to push political narratives, the \u201cresurrected\u201d extinct species, the green screen action sequences that don\u2019t track. A photograph of reality may seem less real than a generated image if it does not abide by our expectations. (See also: reading \u201chuman vibes\u201d into LLM responses)\n\nLook at the snoozefest kayfabe of modern MMA: it\u2019s as much about the smack talk at weigh-ins as the fights themselves, athletes winning by points for \u201ccontrolling the octagon\u201d instead of fighting to win by KO or submission \u2014 look no further than that embarrassment of a so-called fight between Mike Tyson and the YouTuber, who danced around an old man till he got tired so he could win by decision and say he\u2019d beaten a legend \ud83d\ude34\n\nEffective altruism performs charity that can never be disproven, despite its claims of data-driven decisions, because it pretends to think at such long-term scales that known, existing suffering pales in comparison to the imagined future suffering they claim to be protecting against. It cosplays rationalism. Wannabe Foundation shit.\n\nThe Business Borg aesthetic is expressed as cheap cruft disguised as something of substance: words that look like writing, but are not; images that look like art, but are not; fights that look fighting, but are not.\n\nAs Ed Zitron sums up, it\u2019s a \u201csymbolic economy:\u201d\n\nThe sweeping changes we\u2019ve seen, both in our economy and in our society, has led to an unprecedented, gilded age of bullshit where nothing matters, and things \u2014 things of actual substance \u2014 matter nothing.\n\nTraditionally, we have been wary of those wearing a mask, explains Dan Fox in Pretentiousness, suspecting they are something other than what they present themselves as \u2014 but authenticity has faded as a cultural value. Business Borg embrace performance as more true than reality; what someone wants to be is more important than what they are now. What a technology could be is more important than what it currently is.\n\nValue: \u201cProgress\u201d cannot be stopped\n\nThe rapacious assimilation of copyrighted material to train models, the dismissal of AI\u2019s environmental cost and induced demand, and PR campaign reorienting the conversation around AI to its possible future harms as a distraction from the harms happening today all build from the same foundation: theoretically, scaling towards the pursuit of AGI \u2014 but more likely securing the funding to inextricably embed AI into our society and infrastructure.\n\nFoundational Beliefs\n\ntechnology always represents progress\n\nthe ends justify the means\n\nOutcome: GenAI is full speed ahead, no matter what\n\nAdvocates of generative AI are pursuing a brute force, fear-mongering approach to deregulation and preventing regulation. They are defying legality in obtaining training data while declaring the technology a fait accompli: resistance is futile. Their web crawlers ignore robots.txt, breaking the common courtesy of the web. They dismiss complaints about bias, claiming that they can fix that in the future. (And what incentive will there be to ever go back and fix it, once we can\u2019t avoid using it?) They\u2019re hoping enough of us will get hooked on it \u2014 and government and corporations will integrate enough of it too deeply in their processes \u2014 to allow their legally-suspect models to be shut down.\n\nRyan Broderick observes:\n\nWhat the AI arms race has actually done is codified and automated all of the failures of the previous internet era. Extremism, misinformation, harassment, non-consensual sexual material, and scams \u2014 all the content that tech companies promised to fix, but never could at scale \u2014 are now trapped in some AI\u2019s black box of data.\n\nAGI, which has been \u201cthree to five years away\u201d for years, is a Bezzle. As Cory Doctorow quotes JK Gabraith, a Bezzle is \u201cthe magic interval when a confidence trickster knows he has the money he has appropriated but the victim does not yet understand that he has lost it.\u201d John Kay expands that \u201cThe joy of the bezzle is that two people \u2013 each ignorant of the other\u2019s existence and role \u2013 can enjoy the same wealth.\u201d\n\nScams and pyramid schemes are seductive to Business Borg, like Elizabeth Holmes and Sam Bankman-Fried, because the only things they value are money and power, not making things that actually work (see: Cybertrucks falling apart, SpaceX rockets exploding); the trick is not to get caught. The goal is to surf the edge of profit as long as possible.\n\nRight now the whole stock market is bloated by outrageous NVIDIA, Google, Microsoft and Meta valuations based on the potential of generative AI to create a new \u201cessential\u201d utility, a service that everyone will need to subscribe to, forever \u2014 and so many people have bought into the grift so hard they\u2019ll do anything they can to make it a success, or at least rake in the cash for as long as they can. Then when the bubble pops, the corporations will get bailed out on the taxpayer dollar, while we workers resign ourselves to working until we die since we\u2019ve privatized retirement \ud83d\ude43\n\nGenAI is being deployed to control\n\nArtists are under attack, culturally and economically, so it is only fair that they point out the quintessential thing that artists offer that generative AI cannot: taste. Professional (and amateur) artists have devoted a great deal of time to developing their taste. The oligarchs who run Silicon Valley are steeped in their own rightness and devalue anything that isn\u2019t their expertise; if they don\u2019t know about it, it must not be important. To the Business Borg, taste is not an essential component of production.\n\nMandy Brown describes how genAI is used to undercut expertise (emphasis mine):\n\nIt\u2019s instructive that one of the mechanisms for perpetuating this ideology are chattering bots that speak both fact and falsehood in the same servile and confident tone, their makers unconcerned with the difference. In fact, their makers seem entirely concerned with obviating that difference, with disappearing distinctions between knowledge and ignorance, without which truth becomes entirely a product of power. [\u2026] [I]f those in power cannot prove that a great many people are already inferior then they will bring that inferiority about by forcing them to use a tool that diminishes their intellectual and creative capacity.\n\nBusiness Borg like generative AI because it grants them cultural power that they have not been able to dominate on their own. They lack skill, so they devalue skill. They need content, so they make an infinite content machine and conscript users as unwitting factory workers to provide free labor. The relentless promotion of GenAI is an attempt by corporations to capture cultural value by siphoning off value from human-made aesthetics. Generative AI is billionaires punching down on artists and the working class.\n\n[\u2026] I think Miyazaki\u2019s style is still valuable But it is now, in a day, valuable in a different way. What was once valuable in the awareness of painstaking labor, beautiful stories, and coherent aesthetic across the previous two qualities. PLUS our reception to it. Is now valuable PURELY in our reception to, and reproduction of, the aesthetic. [\u2026] \u2014 Reggie James (@HipCityReg) March 27, 2025\n\nGenerative AI has intentionally been molded to attack artists and diminish cultural literacy. Aidan Walker argues (read this whole piece if you liked my post):\n\nAI doesn\u2019t have to be an antagonist to schools, work, and civil society \u2014 they\u2019ve just designed and trained it that way\u2026 There could be guardrails in place, they could pay the producers of their training data, they could give the people a say in how the models are made and deployed \u2014 we could do a thousand things differently than the way they\u2019re being done now.\n\nGenerative AI \u2014 both imagery and text \u2014 is inextricable from the corporate vision for its use: a world in which workers are powerless and worthless, replaced by \u201cfree\u201d generated material. Corporate GenAI cannot be separated from the purpose for its use or the billionaires and billionaire-wannabes who shill for it. The Business Borg aesthetic imbues a sheen of venality.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nGenAI is Our Polyester by W.

It\u2019s not just more Luddism. Many people \u2014 though hardly all, given the popularity of AI products \u2014 sense that there is something grotesque about these simulacra, the people who push them on us, this whole affair. That aversion to the technological profane holds even when various stated objections to AI are supposedly addressed or nitpicked to death.\n\nSee also:\n\nWe need solidarity across creative industries", "label": "non_personal"}

For the first time, I was asked to have my picture taken by the Transportation Security Administration, or commonly known as the TSA. I'm not surprised that an airport such as San Francisco would have these implemented as ways of efficiently getting passengers as fast as possible.\n\nI politely told the TSA agent that I am declining facial recognition. The agent simply conducted a manual document check. It was a very easy experience and the TSA agent was very respectful.\n\nThe point here is that you're not required or obligated to have your picture taken for biometric verification in the United States. You can simply opt-out by requesting so at a point of entry, such as airport customs and of course with the TSA. Your identity document(s) is verified through a manual check.\n\nI wrote a post, Why I Opted-Out of Facial Recognition at Customs and Border Patrol on opting out of facial recognition by the United States Customs and Border Patrol and the experience I had.\n\nMany people don't know they can decline or aren't aware of the risks that facial recognition have in our society.

I'm a participant in the IndieWeb.\n\nWhat is the IndieWeb?\n\nThe IndieWeb is a people-focused alternative to the \u201ccorporate web\u201d. It is a community of independent and personal websites connected by open standards and based on the principles of: owning your domain and using it as your primary online identity, publishing on your own site first (optionally elsewhere), and owning your content.\n\nI am volunteering to host and organize the first IndieWebCamp Sacramento (IWC). It is a great way to bring together your local IndieWeb community and people from the greater IndieWeb community. As the pandemic changed how we interact, online meet-ups have kept the IndieWeb going. It would be nice to meet many of the familiar faces we've seen through the last few years in person!\n\nOrganizing and planning an IndieWebCamp in person involves various parts such as finding co-organizers, planning where to have the event, and the many aspects of event planning.\n\nI'm looking for a co-host or co-host. A co-host would be someone who could assist me in planning for a successful event. It can be someone local near Sacramento or someone who can assist remotely. Having a co-host would help in making the event come to fruition and have the event be successful.\n\nIWC Dates:\n\nThe new plan is to host it during the fall or winter when the weather starts cooling off!\n\nLate September\n\nOctober\n\nNovember\n\nDecember\n\nIf you or someone else is interested in helping plan IndieWebCamp Sacramento, I'd love to have you! Send me an email by clicking here.\n\nLet's have this last half of the year be full of fun events and one of those can be in Sacramento! If you are interested in attending, more information will be available soon!\n\nAnyone and everyone is welcome to participate in the IndieWeb.\n\nThis blog post has been posted on IndieNews", "label": "non_personal"}

Some of the quotes are \ud83d\udd25\n\n\u201cThe movement\u2026 represents in some sense a revolt against the hard mechanical conventional life and its insensibility to beauty (quite another thing to ornament). It is a protest against that so-called industrial progress which provides shoddy wares, the cheapness of which is paid for by the lives of their producers and the degradation of their users.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Walter Crane, The Revival of Design and Handicraft (orig. pg. 12)\n\nI found the layout of the text frustratingly uncomfortable to read. I read through page 145 (195 pages of content before endnotes).\n\nGraphics\n\nInteresting and wide-ranging collection of sample works included (chiefly black and white unfortunately) \u2014 though I was frustrated at least twice when a specific piece would be described in the text but not pictured.\n\nNotes and Quotes\n\nMartin Wiener \u2013 English Culture and the Decline of the Industrial Spirit\n\nDesign theory and categorization of ornament = related to industrialization of design\n\n\u201cThe Arts and Crafts movement was inspired by a crisis of conscience. Its motivations were social and moral, and its aesthetic values derived from the conviction that society produces the art and architecture it deserves.\u201d (from 1989 preface by Gillian Naylor)\n\n\u201cAverting mankind\u2019s enslavement to the machine by saving the mass product and the home from mechanical anarchy and by restoring them to purpose, sense and life.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Walter Gropius, The Scope of Total Architecture\n\ncontemporary critique from Thorstein Veblen 1899: idolizing the handmade \u2013> conspicuous consumption \u2014 \u201cpropaganda of crudity\u201d describing the \u201cexaltation of the defective\u201d aka imperfections in handwork (aestheticization!!!)\n\nthey don\u2019t write insults like this anymore lol: \u201cdisencumber yourselves of the lymphatic ideology of your deplorable Ruskin\u201d \u2013Marinetti, 1912\n\n1835 committee to figure out how to give craftspeople a design sense and *taste* since consumers preferred imported aesthetics\n\nRuskin thought a craft and its society were inextricable\n\n\u201cFor it is not the material, but the absence of human labor, which makes the thing worthless, and a piece of terracotta, or plaster of paris, which has been wrought by the human hand, is worth all the stone and Carrara cut by machinery. It is, indeed, possible and even usual, for men to sink into machines themselves, so that even handwork has all the character of mechanization.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Ruskin, \u2018The Lamp of Truth\u2019 from The Seven Lamps of Architecture\n\nThe Stones of Venice = key book to the movement \u2014 especially the essay \u201cNature of Gothic\u201d (here as printed by William Morris)\n\n\u201cIt is not that men are ill-fed, but that they have no pleasure in the work by which they make their bread, and therefore look to wealth as the only means of pleasure.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Ruskin, \u2018Nature of Gothic\u2019 from The Stones of Venice\n\nRuskin into destigmatizing manual labor\n\nsociety\u2019s wealth measured in human happiness and its works of art\n\nthis is grouping Burne-Jones in with Arts and Crafts rather than Pre-Raphaelite\n\n\u201cIt was just a commonplace thing handled imaginatively, and it gave me as much pleasure as anything in the exhibition.

These are some of the coolest dudes you guys will ever meet. It has been an interesting trip so far.\n\nWe left Nebraska on in the morning on Tuesday. When we got there we got some grub at a great place. Then we hit up downtown. We did a bit of shopping and just walked around. It was fun just being in that urban enviorment. All the buildings are beautiful. Downtown Denver has really cleaned up their act. I like seeing the street performers (the few in the winter).\n\nThen we hit up Redrocks Amphitheater and Park where we did some climbing up the stairs and enjoyed the beautiful sights and sceneries of the area. It was so relaxing. Any part of outside Denver is nice! I like nature. Twas fun. I do not think that I could live in the city\n\nWe had dinner at Five Guys, the burgers were so delicious. Where has it been my whole life. There were many places where we hit up for yummy food!\n\nThe nightlife in Denver is pretty swell!! The city surprises me so much!!!\n\nFound some good books at the Thrift Shop!! Who knew thrifts shops were so badass.\n\nWe went everywhere in Denver. The malls here are amazing and huge. So many sights we wanted to see but time was the enemy. The next trip will be even better.\n\nTime to hit the road! This was a trip that I really enjoyed especially with your buddies. Now it is time to go home and get back to reality. School starts soon and I got to get back to the whole routine.

It is the time where the most people are deep into their major. You know, the point where it seems too late to turn back. This is not the case for me.\n\nI've changed my major various times to in the last two years. It has not been the easiest process. In most cases it revolved around me jumping back and forth between different areas of science or healthcare related fields to humanities. Not deciding what I wanted in my life has had an effect on my greatly. Many friends know to what extent this led too. Thinking back on this tossing and turning made me realize how I truly did not have a passion for the sciences. You know what it really showed me? I am a person who is very stubborn. I was in denial. Deep down inside, there was no want for me to continue in the sciences. My mindset was not open to explore other options. I felt like a failure if I did not become something in the sciences or be something in healthcare. Avoiding disappointment and failure had become the way my life driving towards.\n\nThere comes a time where you have to wake up and come to reality that you really do not have interest in what you are shooting for after attempting various attempts. I should have followed my heart from the very beginning. My advice to you,\n\n\"\"Do not let anyone tell you what you should study. Only y0u know what you want in life.\"\"\n\nI did that mistake and did not follow my dreams right away. It took a lot of courage for me to stand up to myself. It is sort of shocking, huh? The mind is is your worst enemy. I am glad that I did what I did.\n\nNow I am following my passion. A passion that I have always known to have since the first time I took this class in high school. There is this a major sense of relief. I announce that I will fully commit to become a teacher and strive for what I feel that I will do best\n\nThank you for the support.\n\nWith much love,\n\nPablo Morales\n\n\"", "label": "non_personal"}
{"title": "Setting Up Vouch Proxy using Nginx", "url": "https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/setting-up-vouch-proxy-using-nginx", "content": "Setting Up Vouch Proxy using Nginx\n\nThis post was written in English (en_US).\n\nLocation: 38.581573, -121.494400\n\nBlog Post on this using Indieauth coming soon!\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIntroduction\n\nRecently I have started experimenting with identity. An SSO solution for Nginx using the auth_request module. Vouch Proxy can protect all of your websites at once.\n\nToday, I'll demonstrate how to setup Vouch Proxy on an nginx web server. In this example I will be using Google as our provider\n\nThis tutorial assumes you have prior knowledge of using a linux server such as Debian. Message me at hello@lifeofpablo.com if you need some help. I'd be happy to do so!\n\nWhat Vouch Proxy Does?\n\nAccording to the Repository README.md, it states the following:\n\nVouch Proxy (VP) forces visitors to login and authenticate with an IdP (such as one of the services listed above) before allowing them access to a website.\n\nVP can also be used as a Single Sign On (SSO) solution to protect all web applications in the same domain.\n\nAfter a visitor logs in Vouch Proxy allows access to the protected websites for several hours.

An SSO solution for Nginx using the auth_request module. Vouch Proxy can protect all of your websites at once.\n\nToday, I'll demonstrate how to setup Vouch Proxy on an nginx web server. In this example I will be using Google as our provider\n\nThis tutorial assumes you have prior knowledge of using a linux server such as Debian. Message me at hello@lifeofpablo.com if you need some help. I'd be happy to do so!\n\nWhat Vouch Proxy Does?\n\nAccording to the Repository README.md, it states the following:\n\nVouch Proxy (VP) forces visitors to login and authenticate with an IdP (such as one of the services listed above) before allowing them access to a website.\n\nVP can also be used as a Single Sign On (SSO) solution to protect all web applications in the same domain.\n\nAfter a visitor logs in Vouch Proxy allows access to the protected websites for several hours. Every request is checked by VP to ensure that it is valid.\n\nVP can send the visitor's email, name and other information which the IdP provides (including access tokens) to the web application as HTTP headers. VP can be used to replace application user management entirely.\n\nThings you'll need/prepare:\n\nA linux server with a public IP address with hosting and SSL Debian will be used here but any of the common distros will work Certbot is an easy solution to get SSL certifcate for https://\n\nGo Language (to compile vouch-proxy)\n\nVouch Proxy\n\nNginx Web Server Digital Ocean has a good guide if you need to learn how to setup virtual blocks in nginx.\n\n\n\nDownload/Install Vouch Proxy from Github\n\nMake sure to have Go Lang installed\n\n$ git clone https://github.com/vouch/vouch-proxy.git $ cd vouch-proxy $ ./do.sh goget $ ./do.sh build\n\nVouch Proxy Nginx Virtual Block\n\nLet's go ahead and create a virtual block to proxy Vouch Proxy.\n\nserver { server_name vouch.example.com; location / { proxy_set_header Host vouch.example.com; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https; proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9090; }\n\nLet's go ahead and create a virtual block for a regular nginx website site or edit an existing virtual block.

There is something so satisfying to write in different languages. Different parts of my brain activate and it works differently in each language. I also \"become a different\" person as each language influences how I present myself. I am still the same person but I tend to shift according to the target language.\n\nToday, I am going to say in a a video, \"Hello, I'm Pablo\" in three different languages, respectively: English, Spanish and French. I will also share some things about me in writing.\n\nI am really excited to make more visual content in the languages I know and the languages I am learning.

I've been a huge fan of BuzzFeed for many years for as long as I can remember. I remember stumbling on BuzzFeed's home page in the late 2000s. I've taken many of their quizzes posted on the site. There are other things on the site beyond the quizzes. I was very fortunate this week to visit BuzzFeed/Complex's office this week. I was very fortunate to get a tour and check things out! Going there was a whole experience. I got to share this experience with people I know an love. You know that feeling you get when you're a little kid at the grocery store eagerly waiting to see if my parents would buy me any candy. That's what I was feeling. I'm pretty sure I cried a few tears of joy. The office had such a cool color scheme and it went well with everything around it. It seemed very organized. I got to see how the office works and what the type of mood exists. The space was a welcoming right when you walk into. I would say it is a pretty laid back office.It was everything I hoped and dreamed for. I was in heaven.

My music taste has been less stale than when I had started.\n\nPosting on my blog\n\nI haven't posted as much on what I've been listening to. I decided to create weekly post of the titles and artist of respective I've listened to. If there is an album I really enjoyed, I will make a dedicated post.\n\nI built a microsite\n\nI created a microsite on a subdomain on lifeofpablo.com. This microsite will display all the albums I've listened to, so far. I will update as I go or I will update when I do my weekly post.\n\nThe website is https://1k.lifeofpablo.com.\n\nThe site is relatively simple. It has the following:\n\nNavigation Bar\n\nHero Image\n\nDescription\n\nAlbum Grid (Responsive of course :D )\n\nFooter\n\nI will organize it by the decade to keep things manageable. This is how it is organized in the book.\n\nIt's just plain simple.\n\nDocker and Github Actions\n\nI will update it using github actions along with Dockr to recreate the site when I make changes.\n\nRecomendations & Webmentions\n\nAs always, if any of you have any recommendations for music to listen to?

Anyone and everyone is welcome to participate in the carnival.\n\nWhat is self-care ?\n\n\"a multidimensional, multifaceted process of purposeful engagement in strategies that promote healthy functioning and enhance well-being.\" [1]\n\n\"Self-care means taking care of yourself so that you can be healthy, you can be well, you can do your job, you can help and care for others, and you can do all the things you need to and want to accomplish in a day.\" [2]\n\nThere is no one size fits all model for everyone. People's backgrounds such as culture, spiritual beliefs, life experiences, etc influence how self-care is practices. It could also be proactive or reactive. There is no right or wrong way of doing this.\n\nSelf-Care in the Digital Age\n\nWe live in age where we are always connected online. This also adds complexities balancing our lives. Setting boundaries isn't just limited to people. Being always connected to the web is also taxing on our mental health.\n\nHow Am I performing Self-Care ?\n\nLearning self-care has been something I've been working on a lot this year. It has been something I neglected for many, many years. It has helped me be more aligned and be more connected with myself. Finding a self-care routine isn't exactly a straight line to follow. I'm still finding ways to better improve my routine. It's been important to adjust as I go because it's a continious learning process. Some things worked a few months ago and now it isn't working as well before.\n\nSetting boundaries with myself and people\n\nActually find time for myself and appreciate alone time.\n\nActually address insecurities\n\nExcercise such as running or biking.\n\nDisconnect from digital devices as needed\n\nPicking up new hobbies such as hacky sack.\n\nI invite you to write a post on self-care.\n\nHere are some prompts to help you get started or to build off of this post.\n\nWhat type of self-care routines do partake in?\n\nWhat are some hard realizations once you started to take care of yourself?\n\nHow do you incorporate self-care in difficult times?\n\nWhat has been your journey in reaching self-care and your routines.\n\nHow does your self-care routine differ during the week vs the weekend/going on holiday?\n\nHow do you take care of yourself.\n\nDo you check in with yourself too make sure your self-care routine is keeping up with your needs?\n\nI will create a roundup post on the 1 November 2023 on all the responses I recieve.

It's not often I get time for myself other than at home. I either stay home or I go the usual places I'm comfortable going.\n\nI drove down to Simon's Cafe (Chinese Food Staple in Midtown Sacramento. As I was pulling up I remembered they closed down. I was sad. Then I remembered that there was a Thai restaurant a block or two down. Chicken Pad Thai was the meal of choice.\n\nThen, I went to went to happy hour at a Wine Bar across the street from the Thai restaraunt. I had a glass of Sangria. I don't mind a cheap drink during happy hour.\n\nAfter, I went to an art gallery to observe the art. I got to meet the artist of some of the art I admired. That was pretty tight!\n\nThen I came across to the Strapping Store location where ever I was in Midtown. I got some cool Sacramento themed items (last minute Christmas gifts). It's a pretty cool store.\n\nI ended the night with getting Frozen Yogurt. Strawberry Cheesecake Fro-yo and grahm crackers are amazing.\n\nIt was nice taking myself out. I don't do this often. This is something I wouldn't mind getting more comfortable with. It simply is trying to get out of my comfort zone. Overall, I enjoyed the alone time I had. Alone time is good.

Me gusta ir a los mercados de comida y probar todas las comidas deliciosas. Se nos hace agua en la boca.\n\nCelebraciones Mexicanas:\n\nEn mi familia nos gusta mucho cocinar en casa. Hacemos muchos platillos tradicionales. Hacemos tamales de varios sabores, ponche mexicano, mole, pasteles, cocteles de camar\u00f3n, y much\u00edsimo m\u00e1s! No hay l\u00edmite. En este mes, normalmente no comemos en la calle. \u00a1La comida en casa siempre es m\u00e1s rica!\n\nEn las noches siempre vemos unas pel\u00edculas de navidad.

Podemos re\u00edr entre todos.\n\nSiempre ponemos y arreglamos el \u00e1rbol de navidad. Nosotros abrimos los regalos en la noche del 24 de diciembre. Siempre ha sido as\u00ed.\n\nCelebraciones Estadounidenses:\n\nSiempre me reuno con mis amigos. Ahora que no vivimos en la misma regi\u00f3n, es muy importante estar juntos. Hablamos como nos fue este a\u00f1o y que queremos cumplir para el a\u00f1o entrante. Algunas cosas que hacemos son casas de jengibres y tenemos una fiesta. Dependiendo como est\u00e9 el clima, andamos en patineta o vamos al skatepark.\n\nLo que siempre me anima es la noche de programaci\u00f3n. Hacemos un plan en que vamos a programar en una noche.

I would consider them close friends. We've kept this friendship even if they are across the world.\n\nAs a person, I would say I\u2019m a very affectionate person.

I\u2019m very affectionate to those with whom I have a close relationship, such as my best friends. I would also consider them very affectionate as well.

Or you go into System Preferences and do it.\n\nNow you can stop reading. But if you\u2019re weird and want to set it programatically on macOS, here\u2019s a hacky way to do it using Nix-Darwin.\n\nIt uses defaultbrowser, which is a teeny little CLI tool that calls the relevant Objective-C functions.\n\nIf you run defaultbrowser without an argument, it shows you what browsers you have installed. You then pass one of those browser identifier strings to it as an argument.\n\nSome options for known browsers: safari , chrome , firefox , librewolf , torbrowser .\n\nNow let\u2019s put it in a Nix-Darwin setup.\n\nlet vars = { # ... defaultbrowser = \"librewolf\"; }; in # ... your nix-darwin setup\n\ndefaultbrowser needs to be installed as a system package, so let\u2019s add it to environment.systemPackages\n\nenvironment.systemPackages = import ./modules/packages.nix pkgs ++ (if (vars ? \"defaultbrowser\" && builtins.isString vars.defaultbrowser) then [ pkgs.defaultbrowser ] else [ ]);\n\nNow we need an activation script that\u2019ll run it every time you run your Nix setup (which will be relatively often).\n\nsystem.activationScripts = (if (vars ? \"defaultbrowser\" && builtins.isString vars.defaultbrowser) then { postUserActivation.text = \"defaultbrowser ${vars.defaultbrowser}\"; } else { });\n\ndefaultbrowser is clever enough that if you tell it to set your default browser to one that already is your default browser, it\u2019ll just print a nice message to the screen like:\n\nlibrewolf is already set as the default HTTP handler\n\nI thought about adding the variable to the list of packages (or Homebrew Casks, or Mac App Store apps) that need installing, but there\u2019s a mismatch between the browser identifier string and the package name used by nixpkgs and/or Homebrew. Plus if you\u2019re using Safari, there\u2019s kind of no way to not install it. So you need to make sure you\u2019ve installed the browser, and check the browser identifier string with defaultbrowser .", "label": "non_personal"}

{"title": "Generative AI as a magic system \u2013 Tracy Durnell's Mind Garden", "url": "https://tracydurnell.com/2025/06/24/generative-ai-as-a-magic-system/", "content": "We treat generative AI like magic\u2026 and magic systems have rules. When creating fantasy worlds, writers think about who can use magic, how magic is performed, what it\u2019s able to do, what its constraints are, what the source of magic is, and what it costs. I\u2019m applying a bit of reverse worldbuilding to the real world to extrapolate the rules of the AI magic system.\n\nIslands in the Sky by Death Valley Girls\n\nWho can use AI magic: magic users pay to use corporate AI magic systems. Those who are wealthy and tech savvy enough can host their own local model. Free magic use is mostly limited to corporate largesse ultimately intended to build magic dependency.\n\nHow AI magic is cast: AI spells are cast with written text input through a digital interface. Spells are refined and recast until the outcome satisfies (spells produce different results every time they are cast).\n\nWhat AI magic can do: AI spells can produce combinations of words that are interpreted as writing, code-like material that sometimes runs as code, images that resemble art, and video that resembles reality. It can create imitations of specific human creators\u2019 work, as well as individual\u2019s speech and appearance. It can also mimic human conversation for a span of time before the spell dissipates. AI magic is near instantaneous, allowing people without technical skills to produce text and graphics faster than writers and artisans.\n\nWhat AI magic cannot do: AI magic cannot produce the same outcome twice, nor act upon existing conjurations, instead casting spells anew each time. AI magic itself cannot reference sources, though may be used in tandem with other tools that enable citation (though with questionable accuracy). AI magic cannot reason or write, but its conjurations may create the illusion of intelligence through their statistical consistency with written language use.\n\nThe source of AI magic: AI magic derives from statistical analysis of human-created art, writing, speech, music, and video, classified and sorted by human laborers in low-cost geos.\n\nThe cost of AI magic: Resource costs of AI magic include power, water, and high-end chips, which themselves require specialized manufacturing and rare earth minerals.\n\nSocial costs include the reinforcement of racism and sexism, as well as mental harm to AI trainers assessing inputs to the magic system.\n\nSocietal costs include job elimination and job intensification as positions able to be reproduced in part by magic are eliminated and that magic work is shifted to the remaining workers.\n\nInformation costs include the destruction of the online publishing incentive structure / information commons, leading to more paywalled content; an increase in low-quality material, which makes finding accurate information harder; as well as the danger of political propaganda by poisoned magic systems.\n\nIndividual user costs include critical thinking skills, writing abilities, and patience for conversing with humans.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nThe new magic of AI vs. the old magic of artists by Kening Zhu\n\nSee also:\n\nGenerative AI and the Business Borg aesthetic", "label": "non_personal"}

Stowing your carry-on wasn\u2019t a competitive sport back in the day.).\n\nThe aesthetics of generative AI\n\n\u201cI have become momentarily obsessed with scrolling down the homepage of the MetaAI tool and seeing the infinite feed of what people have been asking of The Machine. The outputs are horribly banal, but the requests are a weird window into THE (NORMIE) HUMAN SOUL AND ITS DESIRES: www.meta.ai\u201d\n\n\u2014 Matt Muir, May 6, 2025 at 8:51 AM\n\n(via)\n\nBy its nature, generative AI produces the most likely image that meets the brief, which devolves to insipid Pictionary-style visual communication: chonky = cat, kebab = food = French chef\u2019s hat. These graphics are iconographic pablum, the uninspired result of gee-whiz curiosity about a new \u201ctool\u201d (toy)(trap) in an environment that discourages personal taste and cultural literacy.\n\nOriginally, I wrote up why I find these particular graphics tacky and visually uninteresting, but realized that ultimately, what they look like doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 it\u2019s the beliefs beneath the appearance that matter. As corporate models are trained further, Generative AI will probably continue to get better, rendering more attractive and/or plausible outputs, but it won\u2019t matter to me how good it gets because I reject the values it represents.\n\n(NB: I don\u2019t want you to feel bad about yourself if you use generative AI, because there are myriad reasons to have experimented with it, including being forced to for your employment; I want you to recognize what it symbolizes when you enthusiastically use this technology today, and make an informed choice about whether those are values you wish to signal to others.)\n\n\u201cWhat is wrong with a counterfeit is not what it is like, but how it was made.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Harry G. Frankfurt, On Bullshit\n\nAesthetics are looks that signal values\n\nWitching Hour by Ladytron\n\nAn aesthetic is an expression of taste for shared values, commonly communicated through a distinct style. We think of aesthetics as surface appearance only, but the formation of an aesthetic\u2019s conventions reflects the why and the how underneath the what. Just as the medium of a thing carries a message, so does its aesthetic. Aesthetics are visually and verbally encoded value systems.\n\nIdeology is a value system, independent of appearances. Aesthetics are the appearance of an ideology, which grow from its values. Subcultures form around ideologies, with members signaling their participation through aesthetics. \u201cGood taste\u201d is aesthetics that express those values.\n\nThough it\u2019s now often reduced to a visual style, the Arts and Crafts movement of the late 1800s and early 1900s was cross-disciplinary and united instead by an ethos \u2014 namely, the nobility of craftsmanship*:\n\n\u201cFor it is not the material, but the absence of human labor, which makes the thing worthless, and a piece of terracotta, or plaster of paris, which has been wrought by the human hand, is worth all the stone and Carrara cut by machinery.\u201d \u2014 John Ruskin, The Lamp of Truth from The Seven Lamps of Architecture\n\nAccording to the Arts and Crafts aesthetic, what is made should signal how it is made \u2014 the aesthetic\u2019s value system weights how something is made to be as important, if not more, as what is made. Surface appearance is borne of the decisions this taste for craft produces.\n\n*(People might instead think of this William Morris quote as the quintessential perspective of Arts and Crafts \u2014 \u201cHave nothing in your house that you do not know to be useful, or believe to be beautiful.\u201d \u2014 and I suspect there\u2019s a reason we\u2019ve been taught to recall a philosophy centered on material possession instead of labor.)\n\nLooking at a Kelmscott Press book (William Morris\u2019 printing company) reveals the printer\u2019s respect for handicraft: they designed custom drop letters and frames, included original illustrations by fine artists like Edward Burne-Jones, used original type modeled after typefaces used by printers like Aldus Manutius in the early days of the printing press, printed with a richer black ink than was standard at the time, and employed a heavy hand in letterpress printing so the design and type would be impressed into the page. Thoughtful, intentional ornamentation is embraced. The artifact itself is a thing to be appreciated as much as its contents; these are books that honor the integrity of all creative workers involved in their production.\n\nEmily Amick applies this analytical lens to reveal the tradwife aesthetic\u2019s underlying values:\n\nPrairie-core. Domestic bliss. Big sleeves. Bigger sourdough starters. And beneath it all, the subtle (or not-so-subtle) message: a woman\u2019s place is in the kitchen. But not because she wants to be there, because that\u2019s where God or her husband or some TikTok algorithm put her. The tradwife aesthetic promises comfort, but it delivers control. It\u2019s softness as a strategy. It\u2019s anti-feminism with a floral filter. It\u2019s nostalgia for a time when women were property, romanticized by influencers who want brand deals from butter. [\u2026] The tradwife says: give up your autonomy and someone else will take care of everything.\n\nWe adopt aesthetics based on aspirational values\n\nJessica Cullen writes that (emphasis mine): \u201cAesthetics aren\u2019t always about who we currently are but rather who we want to be.\u201d People adopt an aesthetic to say something about themselves to others. We intentionally adopt a particular subculture\u2019s aesthetics to convey our belonging and raise our status within the subculture. As Alec Leach puts it, \u201ca lot of the modern taste economy is actually the status economy.\u201d\n\nSometimes, we perceive only the surface level of an aesthetic, its appearance without the values \u2014 as Amick notes, the tradwife aesthetic \u201clooks so damn pretty and nourishing. And we are tired.\u201d \u2014 but whenever we adopt an aesthetic, we endorse (intentionally or not) the underlying values it represents. Amick continues dissecting the tradwife aesthetic and how it serves as conservative propaganda:\n\nWhat looks like innocent lifestyle content is actually part of an organized political movement designed to make patriarchy look cozy and appealing. Because politics is downstream from culture. The vibes that influence how we act and live.\n\nAesthetics matter more than ever because we act in accordance with our chosen aesthetics. As we get more and more of our \u201ccultural\u201d content on corporate silos, politics and purchases have subsumed a lot of cultural tastemaking. In this TikTok, Jamelle Bouie describes how politicians use aesthetic signaling to appeal to voters. Richard Sennett identifies that politicians come to embody \u201cintentions, desires, values, beliefs, tastes \u2013 an emphasis which has again the effect of divorcing power from responsibility.\u201d\n\nAnu Atluru argues that \u201cAesthetics are the modern units of cultural currency\u2014stores of value and instruments of power, capable of appreciating and being monetized at scale. Owning an aesthetic is owning influence.\u201d (emphasis mine)\n\nInterrogating the Business Borg aesthetic\n\nGlass Lux by Glass Lux\n\nThe Arts and Craft movement\u2019s respect for labor inspired stylistic choices that highlighted craftwork as well as the decisions in what goods to produce and how. So how does the Business Borg aesthetic reveal its values?\n\nTo define the Business Borg aesthetic, I\u2019m looking at:\n\nthe values I see expressed through generative media,\n\nI see expressed through generative media, the actions of the corporations behind generative AI,\n\nof the corporations behind generative AI, who buys into generative AI, and\n\nbuys into generative AI, and what else they like that reflects the same underlying values.\n\nWhat genAI is better at than a human artist is being cheap and instant.\n\nThe Business Borg aesthetic uses technology to signal wealth and power. Generative AI is not the only visual expression of the Business Borg aesthetic, just its most recognizable. The aesthetic is also signified visually by CGI-heavy blockbuster franchises, NFT art, and the Cybertruck; and in text by LinkedIn corporate thirst traps, X braggadocio, SEO word vomit, and generated \u201canswers\u201d to search results.\n\nAs political bedpartners, there is overlap between the Business Borg aesthetic and the MAGA aesthetic, but they\u2019re distinct viewpoints. Both share dominance as a core value, decry empathy, center patriarchy, and admire performance \u2014 but MAGA also signals Judeo-Christian morality, traditional beauty standards / traditional gender roles, hyper masculinity / violence, and nationalism. MAGA borrows aesthetics from golden pasts, like Neo-Classical architecture, tradwives, and, as Kate Wagner brands it, Regional Car Dealership Rococo; Business Borg prefer the more modern tones of cyberpunk, solarpunk, and minimalism. Business Borg are regulatory libertarians who envision themselves as the rightful leaders of society, Kings of techno-city-states; MAGA are Christian nationalists who want to use the power of the state to impose their beliefs on others.\n\nElon is a Business Borg at heart but wielded a chainsaw to appeal to the more violent MAGA aesthetic. Zuckerberg is a Business Borg but got a MAGA makeover with masculine stubble and bling.\n\nWhy am I naming this after the Borg? Like Star Trek\u2019s Borg, this is an aesthetic rooted in extractive consumption, assimilationist dominance, neo-colonial expansionism, self-righteous conviction, reductionist thinking, and proclamations of inevitability. It idolizes technology, often inspired by older science-fiction, and draws on cyberpunk aesthetics. The Silicon Valley Collective values groupthink and believes themselves superior to \u201cthe other.\u201d\n\nWho embraces this aesthetic\n\nNot all users of Generative AI embrace the Business Borg aesthetic. I think a lot of people are experimenting with generative AI out of neophilic curiosity, productivity imperatives, nihilistic determinism, and corporate fiat. Aspiring billionaires adopt the Business Borg aesthetic to signal their belonging in the cohort of the techno-rich.\n\nGenAI evangelists seem to be the same type of person who was into passive income and supplements fifteen years ago, then Soylent and SEO ten years ago, then NFTs and macro diets five years ago, now genAI and X blue checks.\n\nThe Business Borg aesthetic combines tech-centered neophilia, a hustle mindset, an obsession with optimization, evangelical fervor, and fake-it-till-you-make-it showmanship.\n\nThe Elon fanclub are Business Borg. Ed Zitron\u2019s Business Idiot shares a lot of characteristics with Business Borg (and may even be the same group, but I think feels a little different?).\n\nThe subculture emphasizes high profile demonstrations of \u201cwinning\u201c \u2014 using a $10k NFT as their X profile pic, bragging about SEO heists ripping off a competitor, generosity stunts a la Mr Beast, rubbing it in Miyazaki\u2019s face that there will be thousands of shitty knockoffs vaguely reminiscent of his work across the web.\n\nBusiness Borg signal their busyness \u2014 and importance \u2014 by broadcasting how little they sleep, how much they work, and how little they read. The only fiction they like is (old) sci-fi because they read it as non-fiction, not fiction \u2014 a source of \u201cinspiration\u201d stripped of context and commentary. Using GenAI signals their adoption of cutting edge technology, the synthetic smoothness emphasizing its nonhuman origin. They care a lot about IQ, a supposedly impartial measure of intelligence that rewards their backgrounds and thinking styles, and idolize \u201cgenius.\u201d They\u2019re not actually neurodivergent, but play on stereotypes of autistic savants to cover for their pathological greed and lack of empathy.\n\nTheir visual and linguistic taste is mid because taste is not valued in the Business Borg aesthetic. In fact, there\u2019s a certain pride in prompting things without having any skill, an almost gleeful snub to the perceived cultural gatekeepers \u2014 artists and writers and other creative workers \u2014 whose opinions the Business Borg disrespect because they believe that authority derives from money, not knowledge. They believe artists have wasted their time learning skills and developing taste. Academics have wasted their time studying things when information is just a click away. Business Borg don\u2019t care about anything besides making money, and don\u2019t care much how they spend it because the point is to have it, and show off that they have it.\n\nInto The Water by Ritual Howls\n\nGenAI True Believers often resemble the CEOs at the head of tech companies: wealthy, male, and white. These are also the people who are least at threat from the widespread use of generative AI, which reinforces racial and gender stereotypes and purports neutrality while serving up right-wing biases and corporate and foreign propaganda. Audrey Watters points out:\n\n\u201cComputing (in general and ed-tech specifically) has long been the bastion of white male privilege; and while there had been efforts to change that \u2013 in pipelines and on panels and whatnot \u2013 AI is clearly a re-entrenchment of that power, explicitly so with the Trump Administration\u2019s dismantling of civil rights protections, echoed by the tech industry\u2019s dismantling of its own DEI initiatives.\u201d\n\nAnil Dash describes \u201cAI-first\u201d as this year\u2019s \u201cReturn to Office.\u201d Managers didn\u2019t care about in-office culture until it was made clear that workers could carry on just fine without them; managers care about AI only insomuch as it permits controlling \u2014 and firing \u2014 workers.\n\nWhat the Business Borg aesthetic represents is more important than its appearance; it represents the dominance of ordinal thinking and the ability of moneyed power to do as it wishes without regard to law or morality \u2014 in short, the hierarchical worldview that some people are better than others and that their preferences trump their lesser\u2019s needs.\n\n\u201cWe will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own. Your culture will adapt to service us. Resistance is futile.\u201d \u2014 the Borg\n\nValues driving the Business Borg aesthetic\n\nTeri Kanefield breaks down Leor Zmigrod\u2019s book on ideology, explaining that \u201cAll ideologies seek a utopia.\u201d The Business Borg utopia puts billionaires and their ilk high atop society, in control via the technology they own.\n\nCore values I see uniting the Business Borg aesthetic are:\n\nonly the output matters efficiency is king quantity over quality appearance trumps reality \u201cprogress\u201d cannot be stopped\n\nValue: Only the output matters\n\nGenerative AI is being marketed to businesses as a low-cost replacement for workers that cuts steps \u2014 and collaboration \u2014 out of the process. This is a box-checking culture; all that matters is that an email was sent, a presentation was created, the newspaper had a summer reading insert, no matter the books on it were imaginary.\n\nFoundational beliefs\n\nprocess does not add value and wastes time\n\nthe world is reducible to data , and every question has one objectively correct answer\n\n, and every question has communication and collaboration are a waste of time (\u201cemail jobs\u201d)\n\n(\u201cemail jobs\u201d) experience is irrelevant\n\nOutcome: Tech reduces the complex to input and output\n\nIn contrast with the Arts and Crafts movement, the Business Borg aesthetic actively conceals human labor and venerates the wisdom of the machine. Generative text and graphics simulate a performance of human-less \u2014 cost-less \u2014 automation. Generative answers encourage a reliance on the machine to synthesize on one\u2019s behalf \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t matter to search engines that the \u201canswers\u201d their AI has provided cite sources incorrectly.\n\nHumans are perceived as sources of inefficiency under the Business Borg ideology, because they must be compensated in accordance with their skills and how much time they spend working. Generating material is rooted in devaluing both skill and process. The invented summer reading list was the result of forcing a single contractor to prepare an impossible quantity of work; generating content was the only way for the poor bloke to produce the content on budget. No one reviewed it, because Business Borg only care that the product exists.\n\nEd Zitron describes the evolution of the Business Idiot, personified by middle managers who are completely dissociated from the product they\u2019re selling and explicitly do not do work (emphasis mine):\n\n[Business Idiots] see every part of our lives as a series of inputs and outputs. They boast about how many books they\u2019ve read rather than the content of said books, about how many hours they work (even though they never, ever work that many), about high level they are in a video game they clearly don\u2019t play, about the money they\u2019ve raised and the scale they\u2019ve raised it at, and about how expensive and fancy their kitchen gadgets are. Everything is dominance, acquisition, growth and possession over any lived experience, because their world is one where the journey doesn\u2019t matter, because their journeys are riddled with privilege and the persecution of others in the pursuit of success. These people don\u2019t want to automate work, they want to automate existence. They fantasize about hitting a button and something happening, because experiencing \u2014 living! \u2014 is beneath them, or at least your lives and your wants and your joy are.\n\nValue: Efficiency is king\n\nGenerative AI produces endless content for low cost. Corporations are using Generative AI as an excuse to lay off workers and intensify the jobs of those remaining.\n\nReady Aim Fire (Owl Vision Remix) [Single] by Blue Stahli\n\nFoundational beliefs\n\nthe more mechanized a process is, the more efficient it becomes because humans are naturally inefficient\n\nOutcome: GenAI performs \u201cefficiency\u201d\n\nGenerative AI need not actually reduce work or cost to represent efficiency when mechanization is always favored over people. The Business Borg aesthetic perceives automation as efficient \u2014 hence situations where workers are paid to simulate chatbots simulating human agents on customer service platforms, Microsoft devs handhold Copilot, and GM\u2019s Cruise \u201cautonomous\u201d taxis needed remote human intervention every 4-5 miles!!!\n\nEfficiency is a code word for shareholders, just like \u201ccost-cutting,\u201d who know that these phrases mean putting the boot on workers\u2019 necks for short-term profits. This efficiency aesthetic is used to justify outrageously profitable companies continuing to slash workers *cough Microsoft* It plays out as Hollywood demolishing the screenwriter profession to save a buck on writing rooms and self-cannibalizing the development of future acting talent by forcing extras to be body scanned so they can be reproduced by AI.\n\nJeremy comments on the use of genAI in coding, noting that it\u2019s justified by claims like \u201cworking code wins\u201d \u2014 as in, what it looks like under the hood and how it\u2019s constructed don\u2019t matter. I\u2019m not a coder, but I\u2019ve seen enough HTML produced by PageMaker and other CMSs to be skeptical of the quality of any generated code \u2014 is genAI producing the coding equivalent of tables for web layout? \ud83e\udd14 The Business Borg aesthetic accepts mediocrity without understanding; easy and fast is always best. Good enough is always good enough.\n\nValue: Quantity over quality\n\nGenerative AI is billed as a good-enough tool that will speed up production. Cory Doctorow writes of the managerial push to automate with AI:\n\nThe point of using automation to weaken labor isn\u2019t just cheaper products \u2013 it\u2019s cheaper, defective products, inflicted on the unsuspecting and defenseless public who are no longer protected by workers\u2019 professionalism and pride in their jobs.\n\nEnormous by LLgL TNDR\n\nFoundational beliefs\n\nprofit today trumps tomorrow\u2019s concerns \u2014 someone else will have to fix \u2018that problem\u2019\n\n\u2014 someone else will have to fix \u2018that problem\u2019 money is authority \u2014 individual rankings can be quantified by wealth\n\n\u2014 individual rankings can be quantified by wealth anything that cannot be quantified is not important\n\nOutcome: Algorithms produce culture-like media, not culture\n\nGenAI and corporate web algorithms are intended to absorb attention like black absorbs light; they are designed to maximize engagement at minimal cost. Spotify benefits from degradation of culture. Netflix is a chum machine, built to spew content that people watch in the background. Kyle Raymond Fitzpatrick laments that \u201cSo much of culture is edgeless and soft, intended for us to astroglide through it without any friction or doubt as we half-watch in 1.5x speed, to consume as if we really are incapable of critical thoughts, all to appeal to everyone and no one at the same time.\u201d Internet Age capitalism produces entertainment that is culture-like, writes Nicholas Carr:\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really being tested here is human taste. Will we accept a simulacrum of a work of art or craft as a satisfactory substitute for the real thing?\u201d\n\nSo long as people accept cheap low-quality cultural media, businesses have little incentive to pay for higher quality. Generative AI becomes an attack on culture because it drowns out human-made art and writing so it\u2019s impossible to find amidst the Great Social Media Garbage Patch. Aidan Walker describes all this as \u2018 slop capitalism \u2018: \u201can economic and cultural system in which the primary product is slop and the primary activity is the destruction of value rather than its creation.\u201d\n\nValue: Appearances trump reality\n\nGenerative AI produces plausible graphics that we interpret as real-adjacent and plausible combinations of text that we interpret as communication.\n\nFoundational Beliefs\n\nperformance of dominance builds and reinforces real power\n\nOutcome: GenAI supersedes reality with performance and symbolism\n\nThe Business Borg aesthetic celebrates audacious performances of infinite wealth and indefinite power: adopters and evangelists for genAI also embrace filling streets with \u201cself-driving\u201d cars over the protests of residents and first responders, raining space debris onto inhabited areas from slapdash rocket ships, paying a fortune for a banana taped to a wall as conceptual art and eating it, paying women to have their IVF babies so they can seem fertile without fucking. While the culture at large has shifted towards inconspicuous consumption, luxury that requires knowledge to see, Business Borg signal their wealth blatantly.\n\nA repeating theme of the Business Borg aesthetic is replacing reality with life-like hyperreality: the simulation of conversation and connection with chatbots, the renderings of war and disaster mimicking photojournalism to push political narratives, the \u201cresurrected\u201d extinct species, the green screen action sequences that don\u2019t track. A photograph of reality may seem less real than a generated image if it does not abide by our expectations. (See also: reading \u201chuman vibes\u201d into LLM responses)\n\nLook at the snoozefest kayfabe of modern MMA: it\u2019s as much about the smack talk at weigh-ins as the fights themselves, athletes winning by points for \u201ccontrolling the octagon\u201d instead of fighting to win by KO or submission \u2014 look no further than that embarrassment of a so-called fight between Mike Tyson and the YouTuber, who danced around an old man till he got tired so he could win by decision and say he\u2019d beaten a legend \ud83d\ude34\n\nEffective altruism performs charity that can never be disproven, despite its claims of data-driven decisions, because it pretends to think at such long-term scales that known, existing suffering pales in comparison to the imagined future suffering they claim to be protecting against. It cosplays rationalism. Wannabe Foundation shit.\n\nThe Business Borg aesthetic is expressed as cheap cruft disguised as something of substance: words that look like writing, but are not; images that look like art, but are not; fights that look fighting, but are not.\n\nAs Ed Zitron sums up, it\u2019s a \u201csymbolic economy:\u201d\n\nThe sweeping changes we\u2019ve seen, both in our economy and in our society, has led to an unprecedented, gilded age of bullshit where nothing matters, and things \u2014 things of actual substance \u2014 matter nothing.\n\nTraditionally, we have been wary of those wearing a mask, explains Dan Fox in Pretentiousness, suspecting they are something other than what they present themselves as \u2014 but authenticity has faded as a cultural value. Business Borg embrace performance as more true than reality; what someone wants to be is more important than what they are now. What a technology could be is more important than what it currently is.\n\nValue: \u201cProgress\u201d cannot be stopped\n\nThe rapacious assimilation of copyrighted material to train models, the dismissal of AI\u2019s environmental cost and induced demand, and PR campaign reorienting the conversation around AI to its possible future harms as a distraction from the harms happening today all build from the same foundation: theoretically, scaling towards the pursuit of AGI \u2014 but more likely securing the funding to inextricably embed AI into our society and infrastructure.\n\nFoundational Beliefs\n\ntechnology always represents progress\n\nthe ends justify the means\n\nOutcome: GenAI is full speed ahead, no matter what\n\nAdvocates of generative AI are pursuing a brute force, fear-mongering approach to deregulation and preventing regulation. They are defying legality in obtaining training data while declaring the technology a fait accompli: resistance is futile. Their web crawlers ignore robots.txt, breaking the common courtesy of the web. They dismiss complaints about bias, claiming that they can fix that in the future. (And what incentive will there be to ever go back and fix it, once we can\u2019t avoid using it?) They\u2019re hoping enough of us will get hooked on it \u2014 and government and corporations will integrate enough of it too deeply in their processes \u2014 to allow their legally-suspect models to be shut down.\n\nRyan Broderick observes:\n\nWhat the AI arms race has actually done is codified and automated all of the failures of the previous internet era. Extremism, misinformation, harassment, non-consensual sexual material, and scams \u2014 all the content that tech companies promised to fix, but never could at scale \u2014 are now trapped in some AI\u2019s black box of data.\n\nAGI, which has been \u201cthree to five years away\u201d for years, is a Bezzle. As Cory Doctorow quotes JK Gabraith, a Bezzle is \u201cthe magic interval when a confidence trickster knows he has the money he has appropriated but the victim does not yet understand that he has lost it.\u201d John Kay expands that \u201cThe joy of the bezzle is that two people \u2013 each ignorant of the other\u2019s existence and role \u2013 can enjoy the same wealth.\u201d\n\nScams and pyramid schemes are seductive to Business Borg, like Elizabeth Holmes and Sam Bankman-Fried, because the only things they value are money and power, not making things that actually work (see: Cybertrucks falling apart, SpaceX rockets exploding); the trick is not to get caught. The goal is to surf the edge of profit as long as possible.\n\nRight now the whole stock market is bloated by outrageous NVIDIA, Google, Microsoft and Meta valuations based on the potential of generative AI to create a new \u201cessential\u201d utility, a service that everyone will need to subscribe to, forever \u2014 and so many people have bought into the grift so hard they\u2019ll do anything they can to make it a success, or at least rake in the cash for as long as they can. Then when the bubble pops, the corporations will get bailed out on the taxpayer dollar, while we workers resign ourselves to working until we die since we\u2019ve privatized retirement \ud83d\ude43\n\nGenAI is being deployed to control\n\nArtists are under attack, culturally and economically, so it is only fair that they point out the quintessential thing that artists offer that generative AI cannot: taste. Professional (and amateur) artists have devoted a great deal of time to developing their taste. The oligarchs who run Silicon Valley are steeped in their own rightness and devalue anything that isn\u2019t their expertise; if they don\u2019t know about it, it must not be important. To the Business Borg, taste is not an essential component of production.\n\nMandy Brown describes how genAI is used to undercut expertise (emphasis mine):\n\nIt\u2019s instructive that one of the mechanisms for perpetuating this ideology are chattering bots that speak both fact and falsehood in the same servile and confident tone, their makers unconcerned with the difference. In fact, their makers seem entirely concerned with obviating that difference, with disappearing distinctions between knowledge and ignorance, without which truth becomes entirely a product of power. [\u2026] [I]f those in power cannot prove that a great many people are already inferior then they will bring that inferiority about by forcing them to use a tool that diminishes their intellectual and creative capacity.\n\nBusiness Borg like generative AI because it grants them cultural power that they have not been able to dominate on their own. They lack skill, so they devalue skill. They need content, so they make an infinite content machine and conscript users as unwitting factory workers to provide free labor. The relentless promotion of GenAI is an attempt by corporations to capture cultural value by siphoning off value from human-made aesthetics. Generative AI is billionaires punching down on artists and the working class.\n\n[\u2026] I think Miyazaki\u2019s style is still valuable But it is now, in a day, valuable in a different way. What was once valuable in the awareness of painstaking labor, beautiful stories, and coherent aesthetic across the previous two qualities. PLUS our reception to it. Is now valuable PURELY in our reception to, and reproduction of, the aesthetic. [\u2026] \u2014 Reggie James (@HipCityReg) March 27, 2025\n\nGenerative AI has intentionally been molded to attack artists and diminish cultural literacy. Aidan Walker argues (read this whole piece if you liked my post):\n\nAI doesn\u2019t have to be an antagonist to schools, work, and civil society \u2014 they\u2019ve just designed and trained it that way\u2026 There could be guardrails in place, they could pay the producers of their training data, they could give the people a say in how the models are made and deployed \u2014 we could do a thousand things differently than the way they\u2019re being done now.\n\nGenerative AI \u2014 both imagery and text \u2014 is inextricable from the corporate vision for its use: a world in which workers are powerless and worthless, replaced by \u201cfree\u201d generated material. Corporate GenAI cannot be separated from the purpose for its use or the billionaires and billionaire-wannabes who shill for it. The Business Borg aesthetic imbues a sheen of venality.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nGenAI is Our Polyester by W.

That aversion to the technological profane holds even when various stated objections to AI are supposedly addressed or nitpicked to death.\n\nSee also:\n\nWe need solidarity across creative industries", "label": "non_personal"}

It\u2019s a sharecropping system, but the sharecroppers are generally happy because their interest lies in self-expression or socializing, not in making money, and, besides, the economic value of each of their individual contributions is trivial. It\u2019s only by aggregating those contributions on a massive scale \u2013 on a web scale \u2013 that the business becomes lucrative. To put it a different way, the sharecroppers operate happily in an attention economy while their overseers operate happily in a cash economy.\n\nI encountered this (old) analogy for social media platforms as digital sharecropping and thought it also fit generative AI. Generative AI companies steal our intellectual property then license it back to us. We can\u2019t be compensated reasonably for our individual contributions to the model because they\u2019ve stolen from so many of us and each individual\u2019s work represents a miniscule portion of the entire model. Whatever we generate with their models can\u2019t be copyrighted and used to make money for *us* without significant human contributions \u2014 but generated works are in direct competition with the creators whose works built the model. These powerful, well-funded companies want businesses to fire their employees and pay them instead, making businesses reliant on an opaque, unpredictable service that demands vast amounts of natural resources that may be in short \u2014 and shortening \u2014 supply.\n\nBut unlike social media, which rewards users emotionally rather than financially for their labor, creators aren\u2019t getting anything out of having our work used to train generative AI models. And so we\u2019re fighting back earlier in the cycle than with social media \u2014 maybe before it can become entrenched.

Fair warning, this is a 5000 word post; I\u2019ve been working on this for weeks, pulling together what I\u2019ve learned about generative AI and culture over the past two years, so I hope it is worth your time \ud83d\ude04 Bonus: it doubles as a playlist \ud83c\udfb6\n\n\u201c\u2018Real power\u2019 is achieved when a technology \u2018[leaves] mythology and [enters] banality,'\u201d Marion Fourcade and Kieran Healy quote Vincent Mosco in The Ordinal Society. We\u2019ve had the mythology stage \u2014 the world tour with grandiose prophecies of imminent AGI \u2014 but now the race to normalize generative AI* is on: tech corporations are attempting to inure people to generative AI, an expression of the Business Borg aesthetic that currently carries a negative stigma outside of tech.\n\n*(My rule of thumb: if something is described as AI, it\u2019s probably predatory and/or bullshit; if it\u2019s described as machine learning, it probably does something useful. Not always true but a helpful predictor.)\n\nIn general, people like what we recognize better than what we don\u2019t \u2014 we prefer cultural works we can categorize to the unfamiliar and undefinable \u2014 and we are facing an inescapable shock-and-awe barrage of genAI graphics across the web to inundate our synapses with uncanny synthetic renderings.\n\nCurrently, generative AI is shunned by many artists and writers, the traditional arbiters of good taste and culture, because it has been developed through the theft of their labor. But tech CEOs stand to make (even bigger) fortunes if they can convince people that genAI doesn\u2019t signify bad taste, or make it seem like an irrevocable fact of life, like spam emails and text scammers. It\u2019s being deployed upon us with the same lockstep corporate solidarity that forced us to pay fees for checked luggage on flights (younger folks, before 2008 your bag used to be included with your ticket! Stowing your carry-on wasn\u2019t a competitive sport back in the day.).", "label": "personal"}

I can\u2019t even be mad at it. Very comedy of errors, blundering heroes with no business being on a quest \u2014 Scooby Doo high fantasy. The lighthearted storytelling balanced out the extreme angst between the characters. I\u2019m a little surprised I liked it, because I think it could have easily been annoying \u2014 I was in the right mood.\n\nIt could have stood to be shorter and faster-paced \u2014 it took me three sessions to finish reading (usually I try to read books in one sitting) and I found myself getting testy at the 85% mark. I can see that shortening it would be hard with three POVs and the big hurdles they each needed to overcome.\n\nI\u2019m not convinced a second romance was necessary to the story, but it probably would have felt awfully third wheel if Elowen didn\u2019t have her own romance. (I think there could be a version of this story that made Beatrice into Gladwell\u2019s sister and was just her and Clare\u2026 which may have been a better romance than this story, but wouldn\u2019t be a DnD squad.)\n\nI didn\u2019t like Clare\u2019s bootstrap moment, and I\u2019m not actually sure what Beatrice\u2019s was?\n\nInteresting to see a romance publisher pushing in on the romantasy angle as well as sci-fi and fantasy publishers stretching towards romance.", "label": "personal"}

But I\u2019m not having a crisis about my personal life choices\u2026 instead I\u2019m having a crisis of generational impotence. I\u2019m tired of waiting for my generation\u2019s turn, which I am less and less convinced will come in time to make a difference, especially since GenZ seems to be going conservative \ud83d\ude11\n\nOuter South by Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band\n\nI finally got letters back from two of my reps:\n\nSenator Murray, 74yo and in office since 1993 when I was in third grade, wants me to know that she \u201cremain[s] committed to continuing to work with [her] colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find ways to make progress on immigration reform.\u201d Thank you for your complacency Senator. I don\u2019t know how immigration progress will be made with isolationist Nazis tbh \ud83e\uddd0 I don\u2019t get why Dems are taking conservative immigration stances when in my mind the problem is we are too strict on immigration, and should let in more people. There, birth rate \u201ccrisis\u201d solved too! What I want to know now is, what are the Senator\u2019s plans for retirement?\n\nRepresentative DelBene\u2019s office thinks I \u201cmay be pleased to know that [she] joined [her] Democratic colleagues in sending a letter to President Trump expressing serious concern about Mr. Abrego Garcia\u2019s case and requesting an immediate update on his wellbeing and how the administration plans to ensure his safe return to the United States.\u201d I am, in fact, not pleased. I am the opposite of pleased. Is she fucking with me? Does she not go on the Internet? In what world am I satisfied that she signed a strongly worded letter and called it good?\n\nMy resentment towards 80yo politicians who won\u2019t retire and pass their power to the next generation is reaching a rolling boil as the Democrats in charge apparently don\u2019t have an ounce of urgency left in their moldering bodies. I have to think it\u2019s intentional, especially given the way Nancy and co blocked Millennial AOC from a position of power in favor of an old dude with cancer who just died from it (\u201cGerry\u2019s a young 74, cancer notwithstanding\u201d \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44); I think Boomer politicians know how badly they\u2019ve fucked over everyone younger than them, and they will literally hold power until they die to prevent facing justice. (Yeah I\u2019m making it generational, they\u2019ve been demonizing Millennials to avoid looking in the mirror for decades.) They booted 25yo David Hogg from DNC leadership as punishment for suggesting the party should not always support incumbents, making a mockery of DEI principles by using gender equality rules to invalidate his election.\n\nA friend and I just looked it up: Nancy Pelosi was first elected in 1987. She has been in power for basically my entire life. And I am turning 40. Her legacy, in my mind? Losing women the right to bodily autonomy, for not taking Republicans seriously and doing anything about it when she could have. OK fine she did get us the ACA. Thanks lady. But it\u2019s time to go home, get some rest, and let someone else have a turn! (Sorry Bernie, I love ya man, but you too!!!)\n\nI think those in charge should have some stakes in the game. If you\u2019re already past the actuarial tables, you shouldn\u2019t get to make decisions for the rest of us who are going to live in the world our politicians make for potentially decades. (I expect the Supreme Court will be ultra conservative for the rest of my life because Dems wouldn\u2019t dare trying to expand it.) Be a mentor, yes, please! But give up the power. Normal retirement age is 67. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ageist to suggest it might be time for someone two decades past retirement age to pass the torch.\n\nGive me a party with energy, give me politicians who fight! Oh, for an opposition party \ud83e\udd7a I don\u2019t have to agree 100% with them, if they\u2019d just have some gumption. Give me AOC energy, Shawn Fain energy, Pete Buttigieg (!) energy, Cory Booker energy, Chris Van Hollen energy, Kat Abughazaleh energy. Not whatever this pathetic excuse for \u201cleadership\u201d is.

They both really needed replacing. We\u2019d hoped to have it done before the winter started since our furnace had already been on the fritz for several years \u2014 but the equipment was on backorder.\n\nMy energy utility, Puget Sound Energy (PSE), wants people to stay on gas, so there weren\u2019t incentives from them for this switch; however, my city developed a bulk purchase and incentive program to assist homeowners in transitioning to support the community\u2019s climate goals. This upgrade electrified our whole house, so we could shut off our gas service!*\n\nNow that I\u2019ve had a heat pump for a year, I wanted to share my experience, because I had questions and misconceptions that I didn\u2019t get answered beforehand. Tl;dr it\u2019s great, especially the cooling, just works a little differently.\n\n(Heads-up: 2500 word post, but it\u2019s got graphs! \ud83e\udd29)\n\n*Technically we still have a gas fireplace installed, but we never used it. PSE said it was safe to simply turn off even if that means there might be a small amount of gas remaining in the pipes under the house.\n\nWhy we got a heat pump\n\nOur old setup was failing\n\nBefore the upgrade, we had a ~20 year old gas furnace and an old gas water heater. In November 2019, a pipe on our water heater ruptured, spraying a ton of scalding water into our garage ceiling, filling the entire garage with steam that we had to hire a company to install fans for days to dry out. After that, the furnace began to fail regularly, falsely tripping the safety shut-off and needing to be restarted multiple times a day. We had people out to fix it multiple times, but the most they could figure was that something inside was corroded and they\u2019d clean it to buy us another few months.\n\nMy husband\u2019s telecommuted for years, and during the pandemic, I started working from home too \u2014 but the only \u201ccooling\u201d we had was a ceiling fan in our living room and dining room. We bought a used portable electric window A/C unit to keep my husband\u2019s office from turning into an inferno, and hefted it down the hall to our bedroom in the evenings. Less than ideal.\n\nNatural gas is terrible for the planet and for people\n\n\u201cNatural gas\u201d is the greenwashed industry name for methane, an extremely potent greenhouse gas. A lot of methane is fracked, which may have impacts on the health of surrounding communities. Methane is piped, often through First Nation people\u2019s lands without permission \u2014 think Keystone XL and Canada\u2019s Coastal GasLink pipeline \u2014 where it may leak and harm the water and ecosystem. Also, some methane leaks during fracking and distribution, contributing to emissions.\n\nMoreover, \u201cnatural gas\u201d is propped up by corporate propaganda that cooking with gas is better than electric, despite the atrocious impact methane has on indoor air quality and its contribution to household emissions. I have an electric stove, so I didn\u2019t have to replace mine in order to get off gas.\n\nWithout gas-burning appliances, our risk of carbon monoxide poisoning is lowered; it would come from some other source, like operating a propane stove indoors (DO NOT DO THAT THING). My husband knows someone who has brain damage from carbon monoxide poisoning!\n\nBasically, \u201cnatural gas\u201d is fucking shit and I want fucking nothing to do with it.\n\nMy new all-electric home energy setup\n\nMy house is about 1400s.f. and has two stories. It was built in the 1980s and our attic doesn\u2019t have enough insulation (we\u2019ve replaced insulation in the basement but not yet dealt with the attic).\n\nMitsubishi heat pump air handler (SVZ-KP24NA) \u2014 24,000 BTU/hour\n\nGeneral Aire residential whole-house air cleaner (GFI #4422 or 4424)\n\nMitsubishi wall head (split-type air conditioner MSZ-GL15NA) \u2014 one unit installed on second floor \u2014 we considered a second but decided to save $$$\n\n\n\n50-gallon electric water heater \u2014 the installer recommended against tankless despite what I\u2019d read online \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\n18-panel / 5.04kW solar system (Itek IT280 photovoltaic modules and Itek Theia HE\u2010t UL 3.8 kW inverter) \u2014 installed in 2015\n\nThe air handler connects to our existing duct system. There\u2019s the outdoor unit, which we placed on the side of the house directly below the upstairs heat pump head, and there\u2019s also the air cleaner in the garage where the old furnace was.\n\nThe city bulk purchase program we went through offered Mitsubishi heat pumps, and we just went with what the contractor recommended.\n\nHow much did the heat pump and electric water heater cost?\n\nI am located in the Seattle area, which has been in a housing boom for a while so contractors are pretty expensive.\n\nThe heat pump cost $19,445 + 10.2% tax for equipment and installation. The permit cost $236.*\n\nThe electric water heater with new dedicated 220v circuit cost $2,145 + 10.2% tax.\n\nOur city provided a $500 incentive and coordinated a $1,200 discount for bulk purchase of equipment, so in total we paid $22,155 for both heat pump and new water heater.\n\n*The permit included an inspection, which failed the first time \u2014 we wouldn\u2019t have known what wasn\u2019t installed quite right, so thanks inspector! He was super helpful and pointed out some other unrelated things he noticed that we might consider acting on.\n\nHeat pump vs. gas furnace energy use comparisons\n\nMy situation will not be directly comparable to most people\u2019s because we have a solar array, but hopefully will still provide a relative comparison. I have provided the electricity we used, which includes power we generated and used directly, but not power we generated and sold back to PSE.\n\nUnfortunately since we upgraded the water heater at the same time, we can\u2019t isolate only the cost of the heat pump \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nObnoxiously, our power bill comes mid-month. To make life easier for myself in the graphs, I\u2019ve represented the month the bill was issued. That typically covers usage from the 18th of the previous month through the 17th of the billing month \ud83d\ude15\n\nContext: weather and energy trends in the Pacific Northwest\n\nFor usage context, in the Seattle area, it\u2019s relatively cool (and we run heating) from mid September through early June. Summer is usually relatively moderate, typically peaking with one or two weeks in the 90s (F). Over 100F is unusual.\n\nHow much more electricity did the heat pump use?\n\nThese data represent solely our electricity use, so you can guesstimate how much electricity we use for heating (and cooling) by how much our electricity increased after January 2023. During the cold months (December through March bills), we used about 1200-1500 additional kWh (for heating our space and water). Over the whole year, we used an additional 7300kWh compared to the previous year. (According to PSE, it\u2019s typical to use about 2800kWh annually for an electric water heater and 6800kWh for a heat pump, or 9600kWh annually.)\n\nYou\u2019ll see that we had a big jump in electricity use in January 2024 (technically mid December through mid January). This coincides with an extremely cold snap for Washington, with temperatures in the ~19 degree Fahrenheit range for about a week. We didn\u2019t adjust our thermostat during that time period, but did run the heat pump head overnight as well as pulled out a small standalone electric space heater to help keep the house warmer during the day.\n\nMonthly kWh electricity used, Sept. 16 2021-Jan. 17, 2024 Month 2021 2022 2023 2024 kWh difference\n\nwith heat pump 1 499 495 1946 1451 2 419 *1044 *625 3 545 1737 1192 4 681 1617 936 5 695 1120 425 6 531 993 462 7 1003 1213 210 8 1212 1059 -153 9 868 973 105 10 577 721 880 159 11 466 541 1274 733 12 430 500 1651 1151\n\nbold = electric only \u2014 heat pump installed January 30, 2023\n\n* About half the February 2023 billing cycle was on gas heat\n\n\n\nHow much methane usage did we eliminate?\n\nIn 2022, we used 770 therms of methane.* Now, we use none! \ud83d\ude4c\n\n*According to PSE, a typical house uses 690 therms for a gas furnace and 160 therms for a gas water heater, or 850 therms annually.\n\nComparing gas therms and kWh electricity\n\nA therm is equal to approximately 29 kWh. Unless I\u2019m being totally unreasonable in converting and combining these values, here\u2019s how the overall kWh shakes out \u2014 a massive reduction in energy used with the heat pump (Feb 2023-Jan 2024):\n\nHow much did it cost to run the heat pump versus the gas furnace?\n\nThe first month we used the heat pump for cooling, I was braced for a radical energy bill, but thanks to our solar panels, we continued to pay the minimum electrical charge in summer \ud83e\uddbe\n\nIn actual costs, we paid $1435 for energy (gas and electricity) in 2022 and $1158 in 2023 (heat pump only); if we assumed that the four summer months of 2022 were $7.95 as in a normal year, that would still put 2022 at $1215. And if we swapped in this year\u2019s all-electric January bill for last year\u2019s gas-heated bill, that\u2019s basically a wash. And now we have whole-house cooling in summer \ud83d\ude0e\n\nMonthly energy bill by year, Sept. 16 2021-Jan. 17, 2024 Month 2021 2022 2023 2024 1 $218.41 *$229.79 $260.96 2 $158.67 $202.26 3 $148.30 $188.41 4 $108.26 $91.73 5 $79.85 $28.09 6 $51.67 $7.95 7 *$36.18 $7.95 8 *$76.16 $7.95 9 *$86.90 $7.95 10 $71.32 *$84.62 $46.02 11 $101.87 *$161.19 $136.05 12 $143.28 *$224.62 $204.68\n\nbold = electric only \u2014 heat pump installed January 30, 2023\n\n* = our solar inverter was not selling electricity back to PSE these months, though was generating power for pass-through usage \u2014 in a normal year the summer month costs would be the minimum $7.95 \u2014 this also means there was no bank to draw from for those fall and winter months\n\nWhat I wish we\u2019d known before switching to a heat pump\n\nIt heats differently than a gas furnace: slow and steady versus bursts of heat\n\nThe first month we had our heat pump, in the cold of February 2023, I was convinced it was broken or we\u2019d been sold too small of a unit. If you go in with expectations that it\u2019s going to be a different heating experience than a gas furnace, you\u2019ll be happier than I was at first \ud83d\ude09\n\nBeing used to a gas furnace, we were used to saying, \u201cIt\u2019s cold!\u201d and bumping the thermostat* up a couple degrees, then getting the immediate feedback of a big blast of hot air and a relatively quick increase in temperature.\n\nIn contrast, the heat pump blows air lightly all day long**. If we increase the thermostat setting, it will take several hours to reach the new temperature. Likewise, when it\u2019s too cold out, sometimes it has a hard time keeping up. (I\u2019m hoping that upping our attic insulation will help hold the temperature better.)\n\n*We had a Nest before, but I don\u2019t think it actually helped save energy since we were home all day every day, so between that and Google\u2019s creepy surveillance I was fine when I found out the heat pump came with a thermostat and wouldn\u2019t work with the Nest. Unfortunately, the included thermostat is kind of annoying to program.\n\n**Because heat pumps blow constantly, the contractor recommended keeping as many vents open as possible \u2014 closing no more than one or two. (There was a technical reason for this that I forget, something about making part of the heat pump get too cold and shut down.) Unfortunately, whoever installed our original HVAC system was, er, clearly the low bidder, so we have wacky vents directly underneath windows and doors all over the house \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f The register that blows the hottest is our downstairs bathroom \ud83d\ude44\n\nSo, with the heat pump, we don\u2019t drop the temperature overnight as much as we did with the gas furnace. We keep the house a more consistent temperature all the time. Then, the poor heat pump isn\u2019t always struggling to keep up, it just holds what it\u2019s got.\n\nThe heads aren\u2019t as quiet as they\u2019re made out to be\n\nWhoever says they\u2019re basically silent hasn\u2019t paid much attention. The heat pump head (which is in our bedroom) makes mysterious noises pretty often, particularly when in heating mode*. My poor cat Mina stares at it, transfixed in horror, as it tinkles like broken glass going through the wash, whooshes like the house is blasting off, brrrs to life unexpectedly, and whirs as the louvers rotate up and down randomly. It sometimes makes noise even when the unit is turned off, which is confusing.\n\nThe fan noises are relatively quiet, especially in comparison with a window AC unit, so that\u2019s probably the frame of reference people have when they talk about it being silent. But it\u2019s not silent if you\u2019re changing from forced air, which actually is basically silent \ud83d\ude09 Overall, it\u2019s not too intrusive and totally worth it for being able to fine-tune the comfort level of our bedroom, but not quite what I had anticipated.\n\n*I am pretty sensitive to noise, but my husband and cats agree on this one \ud83d\ude09\n\nOur verdict: the heat pump is a huge win for summer, good for winter\n\nIt kicks ass in summer\n\nWow, after previously not having cooling in summer, it was incredible to be able to comfortably use my office after like 3pm in the summer \ud83d\ude02 I was especially the beneficiary because in the past my husband got the portable A/C unit since his office was hotter.\n\nThe heat pump couldn\u2019t keep up with the hottest days in the high nineties, but even then still kept the house in comfortable mid to high eighties \u2014 totally fine for us, especially with a ceiling fan.\n\nGood in normal cold, fine in cold cold\n\nOnce we learned how to program the thermostat appropriately, we\u2019ve been happy with how the heat pump keeps the house warm.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest: this thing struggles with the cold cold (below freezing). From my understanding, actually cold places use a backup furnace IIRC, but the temperature\u2019s generally moderate enough in Seattle that we get by with just a heat pump and suck it up for the one or two extra-cold weeks a year.\n\nDuring our recent cold snap, when it was 16 degrees Fahrenheit overnight one night, the house was 55 degrees when we went downstairs in the morning despite the thermostat being set to 68. It didn\u2019t heat up much during the morning, so we pulled out our little electric space heater and an electric heating pad to boost the warmth, and bundled up with down vests and blankets. This is where the heat pump head is key: we were able to keep our bedroom, where the head is located, comfortable overnight (though we did add extra blankets).\n\nAnd honestly? The heat pump\u2019s so much more efficient, better for the climate, and safer for us that wearing a jacket for a week or two in the winter seems like a totally reasonable tradeoff.", "label": "personal"}

A former seminary student who was obsessed with ancient Greece, he started each practice with a philosophy discussion. He wove in, too, tales of past runners and triumphs \u2014 he\u2019d been coach for nearly thirty years already \u2014 creating our own pantheon of heroes, the team\u2019s own mythos. Who of us would one day join its ranks?\n\nMr. Taylor recognized how much the mind and body are connected. He treated our labor seriously, and expected us to do the same. Excellence \u2014 ar\u00eate \u2014 was our goal. I\u2019ll admit that plenty of times I tuned out the talk, but there was something about sitting down as a team to transition from school to sport, using that time to mentally prepare for the physical work.\n\nOne of my favorite rituals was to honor outgoing seniors on the cross-country team. At the final home race of the season, each senior released one of his homing pigeons. (I was annoyed because I had to share a pigeon \ud83d\ude02) As far as I can remember, there was no special meaning to this, it just was a thing that he made happen each year. A created ceremony we nonetheless looked forward to; simply having some marker, however arbitrary, gave the season an emotional culmination beyond the final race, recognition of our contributions to the team regardless of how we placed.\n\nHe built the team\u2019s culture through these shared rites and rituals, building a sense of continuity with past runners both at our school and at the origins of track in Ancient Greece.\n\nI can\u2019t talk about ritual and Mr. Taylor without also talking about Ar\u00eate West. Starting in 1979, every other year he took a group of about eight students from the track or cross country team to Greece. At first, they went to compete, but over the years it shifted into more of a philosophical journey and extended into greater Europe. Over the course of twenty trips, the experience developed its own rituals. (I went on trip thirteen.)\n\nThe first: secret invitation. My best friend hounded me, but I wouldn\u2019t confess that I\u2019d received The Postcard telling me when and where our first meeting would be. (We met every other week throughout the school year to study and prepare for the trip.) We all showed up that first night unsure who the seven other voyagers would be. In my year, the eighth person no-showed \u2014 we never found out who else had been invited and declined to join.\n\nThe trip itself teemed with rituals. My least favorite involved running through the hot, dusty Greek countryside to an ancient track where we were expected to take off our shoes and run a lap in bare feet, like the runners of old. On Ithaca, we ran, separately, to \u201cTelemachos\u2019 beach\u201d. In Delphi, we were meant to sleep in \u201cthe meadow\u201d where many past Arete trips had slept (but he couldn\u2019t find it in the twilight, so we slept on a random dirt road \ud83d\ude12 Apparently on my sister\u2019s trip there was a dead dog in the meadow and they said no fucking way).\n\nMr. Taylor believed strongly in the power of place and designed the experience to provoke encounters with meaning. (Some more successful than others\u2026) I lugged my clarinet across Europe so I could play Mozart\u2019s clarinet concerto outside the building where he died (?). Everywhere we went, one or another of us had been assigned topics to present on or locations to give a reading. (I botched my reading from The Agony and The Ecstasy at the Vatican and read a passage about the wrong Michaelangelo Mother and Child sculpture \ud83e\udd23) Overlooking the Acropolis, one of the boys had to read us Pericles\u2019s funeral speech, as each trip had done before us. In Sils Maria, we walked in Nietzsche\u2019s footsteps and discussed quotes at various waypoints along the trail. Our trip was our own, yet inextricably linked with previous trips through shared touchstones and repeated experiences: rituals meant to connect us to the past, both modern and ancient.\n\nThis is my contribution to the August IndieWeb Blog Carnival, hosted by Steve Ledlow on the theme of ritual.", "label": "personal"}

I started at 11 and was wiped by 2:30 so I didn\u2019t push myself to squeeze in one more.\n\nEnjoyed talking with several of the homeowners too \u2014 one of them has written a book on mushrooming! He had a massive table spread with morels drying in the sun.\n\n\u201cChampagne Creek\u201d\n\n\u201cThis private garden has expanded and grown into a utopia of rare plants, exotic fowl, native habitat and so much more.\u201d \u201cWhimsical eclecticism is Kathy\u2019s guiding principle.\u201d\n\n\u201cBloom\u201d\n\n\u201cThis 1/2-acre garden is an artistic attempt to paint with flowers and plants: full of color, texture and whimsy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Half Acre Wood\u201d\n\n\u201cEvergreen Hollow\u201d\n\n\u201cNestled in the lush climate of the PNW, Evergreen Hollow is a harmonious fusion of Japanese serenity, whimsical fairy charm, and intricate bonsai artistry.\u201d\n\n\u201cDahlia House Gardens\u201d\n\n\u201cOur gardens, at over an acre, are a controlled chaos of thousands of perennials, fruit trees, berry bushes and veggie gardens. We have collected seeds and plants from Tibet, Europe and elsewhere and enjoy a very English style profusion with lawn and intertwined stairs and hidden trails.\u201d (This garden was very much my vibe.)\n\nTakeaways\n\nIt\u2019s lovely to see stunning gardens like these, but also having paid for landscaping, I have to distinguish between what someone could accomplish with many tens of thousands of dollars of hardscaping and what could be adaptable to my yard. Some of the gardens leaned on sweat equity and cleverness, which is what my budget calls for \ud83d\ude09 Boulders are $$$ as much as I love how they look \ud83e\udd7a (Our landscape plan originally called for a fountain but the landscaper wasn\u2019t willing to wait for electricity to be trenched, since it would need an inspection, even though they saw the plans when we got the quote \ud83d\ude44 so, we have a bird bath)\n\nI think some cheapish landscaping cobblestones, metal arches, and more yard art could go a fair ways to adding finish to my garden. I also suspect another couple Japanese maples could pull things together. More paths / focal points in the backyard would be beneficial visually \u2014 we didn\u2019t bother because the freeway is so loud we just wanted it to look pretty out the window \u2014 but I\u2019m finding that there is a lack of places for the eye to land when it\u2019s all green all the time. Without a lawn, and with the path so close to the house you can\u2019t see it from inside, we have few \u201cedges\u201d.", "label": "personal"}

Outright fascism is worse, but there are plenty of things we need to change. Kat Abughazaleh, who\u2019s running for office in Illinois, says:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason every American should not be able to afford housing, groceries, health insurance, public transit (ideally), and then still have enough money to save and take your kid to the zoo or go to the movies with your friends. There\u2019s just, there\u2019s no reason \u2014 we are the wealthiest country in the world. The idea that that\u2019s unrealistic or idealistic or naive or even called childish, I think that\u2019s sucky.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t have to settle for returning to a normal that sucks \u2014 but protest may not be enough to force change. Our current situation has been the Republican gameplan for decades; we will not escape it by liberating ourselves from a single politician. Trump is a symptom, but the rot runs much deeper. We need to reckon emotionally with the long fights ahead; protests alone will not solve our problems. I\u2019m not saying protest isn\u2019t helpful or important \u2014 I\u2019m saying that we need to find space for both brunch and advocacy in our lives. Micah L. Sifry writes:\n\nOne of the most inspiring ways that pro-democracy movements grow their strength is by inventing and spreading ways for the silent majority to make itself both visible and influential.\n\nI\u2019ve been seeing organizers talking about the need to transform the current energy into long-term work, and not let it fizzle out. Jared Yates Sexton describes the way that authorities rein in public speech:\n\nWe are, according to those who want nothing more than to maintain control, supposed to protest enough, but not too much. Because we should rely on them. Because we need to maintain our subservient position under the party as opposed to in conversation and discourse with the party.\n\nOne strategy: focusing on local advocacy and building up\n\nMy pet theory is that most people should spend their advocacy time supporting local (and state) efforts, and donate to organizations advocating at the federal level. The collapse of local news and intense media focus on national politics encourages people to feel powerless because at the federal level most of what you can do is harass your senator. It also frames politics as something \u201cyou do\u201d once every four years for normies, every two years for the passionate, every election for the wonks and zealots. If you get people involved in local politics, I imagine that get-out-the-vote drives become a lot easier because people are already tuned in.\n\nThe local level is more influential than people realize, I suspect. In Washington State, how environmental policies often play out is that they get implemented at either King County or City of Seattle first, then several suburban cities, and then there\u2019s a model and coalition for building a state-level policy. As former city staff, I can say it\u2019s no accident it works this way \u2014 we knew our colleagues at other cities and would learn from each other, sharing lessons and draft policy language. Regional organizations support, both partnering with cities and going down to Olympia during the legislative session to advocate for (and against) bills. We know that Republicans followed a similar model in the evil direction in red states, building up a portfolio of harmful policies to bring to the federal level in the form of Project 2025\u2026 why don\u2019t we do the same for progressive policies?\n\nIf we start thinking and working now, we can set things up for the next state legislative session, then the next federal election, then the presidential election. (I\u2019m not going down rabbitholes about martial law, I don\u2019t find it helpful to indulge in that kind of despairing fatalism \u2014 I think my personal work on managing catastrophic thinking and anxiety has paid dividends here.)\n\nI haven\u2019t decided what bigger thing I want to work on yet\u2026 for now I\u2019ve just been doing ad hoc advocacy when it\u2019s pointed out by the urbanist Discord server I\u2019m in. I\u2019m pissed that Washington had a school lunch bill that failed in the legislative session, so potentially supporting another run at that\u2026 or badgering the governor about Washington\u2019s regressive taxation policy and demanding an income tax on the wealthiest Washingtonians, which he put the kibosh on this budget cycle and was why the budget was too tight to feed kids \ud83d\ude44 Come on, Bob! We have a lot of tech companies \u2014 and tech CEOs \u2014 here who could stand to pay their fair share. Or I could go harder on supporting housing; I just looked at King County\u2019s affordable housing dashboard, which identifies a need for 44,000 affordable units by 2024, and THE ENTIRE SEATTLE AREA HAD BUILT FEWER THAN FIVE THOUSAND UNITS by 2022. *screaming*\n\nOrganizing coalitions\n\nI\u2019m also spinning on the provocation of the second method of organizing described in the Win the Midwest\u2019s 10-year report (emphasis mine):\n\nThere are two approaches to base building. We can ask what we are for, and then go out and find the people who agree with us. Or we can begin by asking who we need to organize in order to build enough power to shift everything, and then go where they are: workplaces, churches, mosques, synagogues, schools, and childcare centers. Grassroots organizations that meet people where they are \u2013 physically and ideologically \u2013 and that create spaces of belonging, learning, and formation rooted in people\u2019s lives and experiences have an unlimited number of people to organize. Most people do not have clearly defined political outlooks, but they can move into public leadership roles. Organizations willing to put their base at the center of their plans can co-create a political agenda that emerges from the lived experience of their bases.\n\nI\u2019m an extremely opinionated person, and I know what outcomes I want (though I\u2019d rather listen to others on the best tactics on achieving those outcomes), but maybe I could think of this as prioritizing which outcomes to focus on based on which ones enough other people also want and will fight for. L.A. Kauffman discusses building coalitions with those we disagree with, quoting a 1981 talk / 1983 essay \u201cCoalition Politics: Turning the Century\u201d:\n\n\u201cThe reason we are stumbling,\u201d Dr. [Bernice] Reagon declared all those years ago, \u201cis that we are at the point where in order to take the next step we\u2019ve got to do it with some folk we don\u2019t care too much about. And we got to vomit over that for a little while. We must just keep going.\u201d\n\nFurther reading:\n\nWhy Do Anything? by Dj Bracken \u2014 this guy decided to start paying down student lunch debt in Utah, and eventually helped get a statewide bill passed (I was loosely involved in supporting new \u201cshare tables\u201d / fridges at our local elementary schools, AMA)\n\nFrom Aspiration to Action: Organizing Through Exhaustion, Grief, and Uncertainty by Kelly Hayes\n\nSee also:\n\nDon\u2019t let them say it\u2019s normal\n\nExtending my understanding of self-care\n\nBeing a citizen means taking ownership", "label": "personal"}

But I\u2019m not having a crisis about my personal life choices\u2026 instead I\u2019m having a crisis of generational impotence. I\u2019m tired of waiting for my generation\u2019s turn, which I am less and less convinced will come in time to make a difference, especially since GenZ seems to be going conservative \ud83d\ude11\n\nOuter South by Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band\n\nI finally got letters back from two of my reps:\n\nSenator Murray, 74yo and in office since 1993 when I was in third grade, wants me to know that she \u201cremain[s] committed to continuing to work with [her] colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find ways to make progress on immigration reform.\u201d Thank you for your complacency Senator. I don\u2019t know how immigration progress will be made with isolationist Nazis tbh \ud83e\uddd0 I don\u2019t get why Dems are taking conservative immigration stances when in my mind the problem is we are too strict on immigration, and should let in more people. There, birth rate \u201ccrisis\u201d solved too! What I want to know now is, what are the Senator\u2019s plans for retirement?\n\nRepresentative DelBene\u2019s office thinks I \u201cmay be pleased to know that [she] joined [her] Democratic colleagues in sending a letter to President Trump expressing serious concern about Mr. Abrego Garcia\u2019s case and requesting an immediate update on his wellbeing and how the administration plans to ensure his safe return to the United States.\u201d I am, in fact, not pleased. I am the opposite of pleased. Is she fucking with me? Does she not go on the Internet? In what world am I satisfied that she signed a strongly worded letter and called it good?\n\nMy resentment towards 80yo politicians who won\u2019t retire and pass their power to the next generation is reaching a rolling boil as the Democrats in charge apparently don\u2019t have an ounce of urgency left in their moldering bodies. I have to think it\u2019s intentional, especially given the way Nancy and co blocked Millennial AOC from a position of power in favor of an old dude with cancer who just died from it (\u201cGerry\u2019s a young 74, cancer notwithstanding\u201d \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44); I think Boomer politicians know how badly they\u2019ve fucked over everyone younger than them, and they will literally hold power until they die to prevent facing justice. (Yeah I\u2019m making it generational, they\u2019ve been demonizing Millennials to avoid looking in the mirror for decades.) They booted 25yo David Hogg from DNC leadership as punishment for suggesting the party should not always support incumbents, making a mockery of DEI principles by using gender equality rules to invalidate his election.\n\nA friend and I just looked it up: Nancy Pelosi was first elected in 1987. She has been in power for basically my entire life. And I am turning 40. Her legacy, in my mind? Losing women the right to bodily autonomy, for not taking Republicans seriously and doing anything about it when she could have. OK fine she did get us the ACA. Thanks lady. But it\u2019s time to go home, get some rest, and let someone else have a turn! (Sorry Bernie, I love ya man, but you too!!!)\n\nI think those in charge should have some stakes in the game. If you\u2019re already past the actuarial tables, you shouldn\u2019t get to make decisions for the rest of us who are going to live in the world our politicians make for potentially decades. (I expect the Supreme Court will be ultra conservative for the rest of my life because Dems wouldn\u2019t dare trying to expand it.) Be a mentor, yes, please! But give up the power. Normal retirement age is 67. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ageist to suggest it might be time for someone two decades past retirement age to pass the torch.\n\nGive me a party with energy, give me politicians who fight! Oh, for an opposition party \ud83e\udd7a I don\u2019t have to agree 100% with them, if they\u2019d just have some gumption. Give me AOC energy, Shawn Fain energy, Pete Buttigieg (!) energy, Cory Booker energy, Chris Van Hollen energy, Kat Abughazaleh energy. Not whatever this pathetic excuse for \u201cleadership\u201d is. Walz had the energy and they told him to stuff it. Brilliant strategy guys.\n\nPlease, please tell me someone is primarying all my Federal reps next election, because I will vote for anyone who shows some semblance of spine \ud83d\ude21", "label": "personal"}

Next we introduced ourselves to the ladies. They are some nice people. The laugh a lot. Like nonstop. Lol.\n\nWe went to go grab some lunch at the diner. The food was great. Im going to love this school. I like the ice cream the best .\n\nOur first activity was about culture. We were asked about describing our culture. Its was quite the open question. It wws alson hard at the same time. It shocked me that many of the participants didn\u2019t know where there culture was from or any inform about it. It was a learning experience for all of us.\n\nThen we did another activity comparing different cultures in different countries or groups of people. it was interesting seeing the differences.\n\nAfter all this we had dinner. Didn\u2019t meat much. I had the option to go to the swimming pools or go do something else. So Colin and i decided to do manly things like excersise. The girls went to the pool instead. I ran a out two miles. While running, Colin worked on his football workout. He is going to be a kicker for the UNK football team. Which is pretty awesome.\n\nI then after we played apples to apples. It was quite intense. Then it got crazy funny. The girls were just losing it with nonstop laughing. It was fun. Hey! We had pizza!\n\nOverall I\u2019m enjoying this camp. I\u2019m making some great friends and being around people who have great interests as I do.", "label": "personal"}

Who knew old fashion was better? Breakfast wasn't what I was used to. It consisted of A slice of bread with cold cut (deli) meats. You cant forget a great cup of joe! What a simple breakfast? we made kolaches. Kolaches are a traditional food in the Czech Republic. They are formed like a cookie. We make a crater in the center to fill it with fillings. Fillings like apricot or cherry fillings. We also had cream cheese filling. Here is the result.\n\nDelicious right??\n\nThen we went on a tour around Wilber. We learned the history and reasons people moved here. One was religious freedom. (Sound familiar?)\n\nI got to play the bagpipes. It was odd but cool at the same time.\n\n[caption id=\"\"attachment_261\"\" align=\"\"alignnone\"\" width=\"\"225\"\"] Me playing the bagpipes[/caption]\n\nThen we learned how to dance polka and some waltz. It was fun. Now i can dance! (I was salsa dancing in Omaha yesterday.) We had an amazing lunch that consisted of duck, dumplings, sourkrout, and a kolache for dessert. I tought it was best meal in a long time. Czech food is actually good and healthy. Richard I'm coming to the Czech Republic for more food. LOL :-P\n\nTo end the stay in wilber Nebraska the local children entertained us by showing us traditional dances in traditional outfits. I think it is cool that these children are continuing their traditions.\n\nNow I'm back in the dorms. Going to go get ice cream or something. Then I'll go work out with my roommate and have some bro time.\n\nFollow my blog by registering!! On the left!!!\n\n\"", "label": "personal"}

Might as well write for today also!\n\nWe started our day with origami. It was a fun activity (if you can get past step 1.) I've done some origami over the years. It was a struggle a bit trying to build something. Not to bad after you get the hang of it.\n\nThen We had a leadership activity with Dr. Machida. It was really fun getting to know about Japan and Dr. Machida's experiences abroad at a young age. It really motivates me to study abroad!! :)\n\nI also learned how to use chopsticks. Who knew that it could be fun? It was a challenge none less.... Now I want to use them at any Chinese place.\n\nAfter Lunch We got to meet some of the students that have been on a study abroad program. Some went to the Czech Republic or Netherlands. They told us their crazy adventures. They also explained some struggles and surprises they experience. I felt like I related to them since I have also gone out of the country plenty of times. They really assured us that it is totally worth it.\n\nWe had some of the international students help us with calligraphy. They helped us all write our names in Japanese. This but also words that had a meaning to our own. I picked 'potential' and 'perseverance.' I say they did a great job . Props to you guys.\n\nThe chopsticks lesson came to great use!! We went to a Chinese restaurant. I ordered spicy chicken. Used my chopsticks to eat my entree. I felt like I succeeded at a life.\n\nLater everyone decided to take naps after a very busy day. I passed out on my bed, so did my roommate on his.\n\nI stayed up later to watch some funny movies... it was totally worth it :) :)\"", "label": "personal"}

My goal is not to get homesick (I will eventually). Like I said I am not going away that far (45 mins.) It is time for me to be more independent of myself.

Man I LOVE COLLEGE! Its music to my ears.\n\nInstead of being a lazy bum and staying in bed all day, I decided to spend my day outside in the good ol' Nebraska cold winter.

Examples of different cultures are the hispanic culture, italian, french, etc. Especially here at UNK we are more exposed than ever to different cultures.\n\nToday I want to talk about how people should be open minded and talk about how one should expose themselves too a different culture. Many of us who are small town people never really grew up with people of a different race or background. There is no harm in that. Once we all came to college we saw how diverse our world really is.. For me I've grown up in two cultures parallel to each other. I grew up in a very hispanic family while being born in to the American culture that I have known since the day I was born. So I could say that I am used to different cultures.\n\nThrough out our lives, we find people who are different from us in various ways. Different can mean being from another country. Being from a different country you have different aspects of the world. Being different is good. Those who are totally different from you are International Students.\n\nI say one should befriend an international student. Help them out. It would mean the world to them. You thought you were scared when you went off to college, they are probably three times as scared since they are in a country that they have never been in before. They will be greatful when you do help them. I know if you ever need a favor from them, they will gladly go up and beyond to help you suceed if you need help from them. It does not hurt to hangout with them. They will learn so much just being around you. You will as well. It is a win-win situation. Take them out to lunch sometime so you get to know them. They will gladly prepare a meal for you sometime. You may not think about it now but they could be of future help when needing to get a job, if they are already in the workforce.\n\nI love to learn about the other cultures. It fascinates me how different and similar cultures are. Me being the avid FOOD LOVER <3 I love to \"\"test\"\" new food for my belly to enjoy. I did not realize that I loved Japanese foodso much. I think that best part other than the insides is the seaweed to make some of them sushi entrees. NO one has anything to lose by opening themselves up to something different. You know what they say\n\nYOU NEVER KNOW UNTIL YOU TRY!\n\nI say go for it!\n\nWhile you can enjoy a culture festival. Here at UNK we have many of these. The most recent one I went to was the Japanese Food Festival. I learned so much about the Japanese culture. I got to see what their traditions truly embrace than just rely on stereotypes. I have made many Japanese friends as well. Being around theses students, you really get a one to one learning opportunity. It really teaches others not to be afraid and to always remember where one came from originally.\n\nThe food was great! Job well done to those in charge of the event. It was a one to remember. Who know it would of been SO much fun to make Japanese food. I want more! Someone hook me up!!\n\nMaybe I'll see you guys at the International Food Festival this Sunday!\n\nCheck out my gallery!!\n\n\"", "label": "personal"}

We travel, we work our butts off to have some financial gains and stability. What's that for a college kid? Summer is also a time to think ahead into the future while enjoying yourself. It is unfortunate that this this adventure is only temporary to help us get away. That being said, I am going to tell you about my summer adventures and what it entails. The summer is slowly slipping to the end...\n\nWorking is important to make money. That's exactly what I have done throughout the summer. For those who do not know, I work at McDonald's as a manager. It pays me well to let me go on adventures. (More on that in a second.) Like any job, it has it's ups and downs. Honestly I am surprised that I have stayed as long as I have. 5 years strong! WOO! Its a job that has many benefits than just the paycheck.\n\nSo now you want to know what I actually did for fun? Alright! One thing at a time.\n\nSo my first adventure was hitting the upper west coast! It was the trip trio: three friends, three places! We went to started our trip off in Denver to catch a flight out of DEN towards Seattle. Seattle was such a beautiful city. Then we crossed into Canada where we spend a few days in Vancouver, BC. Canada was breath taking. I was glad to see Canada for the first time. It was exciting to see one of my friends leave the country for the first time ever! I got to speak a little French here and there.\n\nCan always count on these guys to push me through anything! #summer #canada A photo posted by Pablo Morales (@pmorales18) on Jun 11, 2016 at 7:04pm PDT\n\nI went to Denver a second time recently to the Vans Warped Tour! This is my second year going to this I got to see some of my favorite bands this year! Many of you heard that Yellow Card is breaking up!! I about cried when I heard this. They have their reasons and I respect them for that. They have had such an impact on me.\n\nI got to hangout with friends all throughout. Frienships grew!\n\nThis is only a summary of my summer. Want to know? Just ask!\n\n-Pablo\"", "label": "personal"}
{"title": "Pablo Morales", "url": "https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/published:2016-08", "content": "en\n\n\"Junior year of college is the turning point of most people's education. It is the time where the most people are deep into their major. You know, the point where it seems too late to turn back. This is not the case for me.\n\nI've changed my major various times to in the last two years. It has not been the easiest process. In most cases it revolved around me jumping back and forth between different areas of science or healthcare related fields to humanities. Not deciding what I wanted in my life has had an effect on my greatly. Many friends know to what extent this led too. Thinking back on this tossing and turning made me realize how I truly did not have a passion for the sciences. You know what it really showed me? I am a person who is very stubborn. I was in denial. Deep down inside, there was no want for me to continue in the sciences. My mindset was not open to explore other options. I felt like a failure if I did not become something in the sciences or be something in healthcare. Avoiding disappointment and failure had become the way my life driving towards.\n\nThere comes a time where you have to wake up and come to reality that you really do not have interest in what you are shooting for after attempting various attempts. I should have followed my heart from the very beginning. My advice to you,\n\n\"\"Do not let anyone tell you what you should study. Only y0u know what you want in life.\"\"\n\nI did that mistake and did not follow my dreams right away. It took a lot of courage for me to stand up to myself. It is sort of shocking, huh? The mind is is your worst enemy. I am glad that I did what I did.\n\nNow I am following my passion. A passion that I have always known to have since the first time I took this class in high school. There is this a major sense of relief. I announce that I will fully commit to become a teacher and strive for what I feel that I will do best\n\nThank you for the support.\n\nWith much love,\n\nPablo Morales\n\n\"", "label": "personal"}

I enjoy the freedoms, living independently and eating good food whenever I want. Life has treated me good here. Until more recently, a certain stage of being away finally starts. Lately, homesickness has really started to kick in. I\u2019ve really started to miss my friends, family and things I really took for granted back home. It really is bad when I am craving my mom\u2019s homemade food. (Mexican Food.) Midterms and all the studying is really killing my vibe at this point of the semester. My program is not your typical study abroad program that you go away for 3 months (not to mention that it doesn\u2019t even apply to your major) on a semi vacation. I actually have to try real hard as my french studies here in Strasbourg France will help me graduate next year. Enough bashing.\n\nWith all this, one just feels that they are slowly losing control. Sure I am enjoying myself out here in France but still there is this emptiness of something that I have been away from for far too long. Hopefully, I hope some sort of enlightenment will come bring me back to life. Then It hit me, I would see my friends in just a few weeks. I honestly couldn\u2019t believe in such short time I would be right in front of them.\n\nSo I would be meeting up my good friend Sammy and soon-to-be friend Mitch. They have never been to Europe before, so I figured why not show them around Paris, a city that I know decently and use my French to get to Point A to Point B and of course with the help of good ol\u2019 Google Maps. Paris- Weekend 1\n\nThese guys had a hell of a time getting to Paris during the 24 hours before arrival. I\u2019ll let them explain that one.\n\nSo I picked the guys up from Charles De Gaulle Aiport. I still feel bad on making you guys wait for me. :/ I ran up to my dude Sammy and gave him a bro hug! It has been way to long since I have seen that dude! I also got to meet Mitch and got to know him more through out the weekend. Cool Dude! So I showed them around Paris. To be honest, Paris is beautiful with history written all around. As with any major city, Paris is no exception, it is dirty and smelly. I really hope that the guys did not have too high of hopes for the \u201cCity of Love.\u201d Paris is overrated in my opinion but why not take advantage of leaving Strasbourg for a few days.\n\nSo we went to various monuments such as The Louvre, Arc of Triumph, Versailles and so much more. Many of the places were breath taking. The Eiffel Tour is always a good place to scope out as well as walking along the Seine River. Getting around Paris is no piece of cake but we managed. Never have I ever gone up so many round staircases. Climbing the Cathedral of Notre Dame was such a struggle. Whenever you are in Europe, walking is really the way to get around.\n\nNight life in Paris is pretty popping! We went to a few clubs in the Grand Boulevard District! This district did not disappoint. I wish we could have checked out a few other ones. One of my favorite places was the Irish Pub. Music, dancing, girls and drinks. Man was that a fun night!\n\nWe ate some good food throughout Paris. The guys had their first legit French Croissants and baguette sandwich. It\u2019s totally acceptable to have a sandwich on you at all times. I also had them try one of my favorites, a kebab sandwich. Man are they delicious! Sammy had actual ramen noodles for the first time ever! Overall we pretty much stuffed our faces all weekend.\n\nBruxelles- Weekend 2\n\nAh Bruxelles!! The place known for its deliciouos fries and waffles. You have no idea how much I stuffed my face this weekend. Just writing this post makes my mouth water. Was eating all this food this worth it? You bet it was!! When I arrived in Bruxelles, it was gloomy and misting. Not the way I wanted to start the weekend. The weather stayed the same all weekend. That did not stop the fun.\n\nSpending the weekend in Brussels was totally worth the waffles! The sugar definitely made me bounce off the walls. #belgium #worldtravel #unkstudyabroad A post shared by Pablo Morales (@pablo.morales1) on Mar 19, 2017 at 9:55am PDT\n\nWe checked out many popular attractions throughout the city. There was so much we saw, I started to lose my mind a bit. One of the coolest places I saw was a \u201cWorld Shop.\u201d They had souvenirs and artsy things from all around the world. I was so intrigued with the place that I ended up buying a few things from there.\n\nThe other purpose of coming to Bruxelles was to meet up with our friend Kellie and Sammy\u2019s brother, Louis. It was good to see some other friends from back home. I missed those two! Kellie is just a keeper, to keep a long story short. These two are actually on Spring Break right now. I am so jealous of you guys spending your holiday in Malta! I hope you enjoy every second of it!\n\nBruxelles treated everyone well!\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\nThese last few weekends have been pretty awesome! It was good to see a few friends from back home. I couldn\u2019t of asked for a better time. Traveling becomes more exciting when you are hanging out with people you know and love. I can\u2019t wait for the next adventure with them! So, is it sprangggg breakkk yet? I wish!", "label": "personal"}

{"title": "Pablo Morales", "url": "https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/published:2017", "content": "en\n\nBeing away from home these last few months have been great. I enjoy the freedoms, living independently and eating good food whenever I want. Life has treated me good here. Until more recently, a certain stage of being away finally starts. Lately, homesickness has really started to kick in. I\u2019ve really started to miss my friends, family and things I really took for granted back home. It really is bad when I am craving my mom\u2019s homemade food. (Mexican Food.) Midterms and all the studying is really killing my vibe at this point of the semester. My program is not your typical study abroad program that you go away for 3 months (not to mention that it doesn\u2019t even apply to your major) on a semi vacation. I actually have to try real hard as my french studies here in Strasbourg France will help me graduate next year. Enough bashing.\n\nWith all this, one just feels that they are slowly losing control. Sure I am enjoying myself out here in France but still there is this emptiness of something that I have been away from for far too long. Hopefully, I hope some sort of enlightenment will come bring me back to life. Then It hit me, I would see my friends in just a few weeks. I honestly couldn\u2019t believe in such short time I would be right in front of them.\n\nSo I would be meeting up my good friend Sammy and soon-to-be friend Mitch. They have never been to Europe before, so I figured why not show them around Paris, a city that I know decently and use my French to get to Point A to Point B and of course with the help of good ol\u2019 Google Maps. Paris- Weekend 1\n\nThese guys had a hell of a time getting to Paris during the 24 hours before arrival. I\u2019ll let them explain that one.\n\nSo I picked the guys up from Charles De Gaulle Aiport. I still feel bad on making you guys wait for me. :/ I ran up to my dude Sammy and gave him a bro hug! It has been way to long since I have seen that dude! I also got to meet Mitch and got to know him more through out the weekend. Cool Dude! So I showed them around Paris. To be honest, Paris is beautiful with history written all around. As with any major city, Paris is no exception, it is dirty and smelly. I really hope that the guys did not have too high of hopes for the \u201cCity of Love.\u201d Paris is overrated in my opinion but why not take advantage of leaving Strasbourg for a few days.\n\nSo we went to various monuments such as The Louvre, Arc of Triumph, Versailles and so much more. Many of the places were breath taking. The Eiffel Tour is always a good place to scope out as well as walking along the Seine River. Getting around Paris is no piece of cake but we managed. Never have I ever gone up so many round staircases. Climbing the Cathedral of Notre Dame was such a struggle. Whenever you are in Europe, walking is really the way to get around.\n\nNight life in Paris is pretty popping! We went to a few clubs in the Grand Boulevard District! This district did not disappoint. I wish we could have checked out a few other ones. One of my favorite places was the Irish Pub. Music, dancing, girls and drinks. Man was that a fun night!\n\nWe ate some good food throughout Paris. The guys had their first legit French Croissants and baguette sandwich. It\u2019s totally acceptable to have a sandwich on you at all times. I also had them try one of my favorites, a kebab sandwich. Man are they delicious! Sammy had actual ramen noodles for the first time ever! Overall we pretty much stuffed our faces all weekend.\n\nBruxelles- Weekend 2\n\nAh Bruxelles!! The place known for its deliciouos fries and waffles. You have no idea how much I stuffed my face this weekend. Just writing this post makes my mouth water. Was eating all this food this worth it? You bet it was!! When I arrived in Bruxelles, it was gloomy and misting. Not the way I wanted to start the weekend. The weather stayed the same all weekend. That did not stop the fun.\n\nSpending the weekend in Brussels was totally worth the waffles! The sugar definitely made me bounce off the walls. #belgium #worldtravel #unkstudyabroad A post shared by Pablo Morales (@pablo.morales1) on Mar 19, 2017 at 9:55am PDT\n\nWe checked out many popular attractions throughout the city.

Getting the insights from another teacher lets you have a feeling of what its like to be in the classroom. Enjoy the interview! I will have the audio podcast available soon! Click here to download a copy of the document to your device.\n\nDenise Teetor: ESL at Hastings Senior High School\n\nInterviewed by\n\nPablo MORALES GARCIA\n\nMrs. Denise Teetor is an English as a Second Language Teacher at Hastings Senior High School in Hastings Nebraska. She has been teaching at the high school for more than 30 years. She has quite a different perspective of the world since she has traveled outside of the United States plenty of times. She has seen so many changes in ESL over the years. She has quite the story to tell in which she becomes the ESL teacher she is today.\n\nMrs. Teetor was not an ESL teacher from the beginning. She use to teach physical education and coach for a long time. She decided to pursue a different area of teaching and left behind being an PE teacher and decided to teach English in Japan. She wanted to do something different with her time during the summers instead of wasting it. She saw an advertisement to teach in Japan for six weeks and thought \u201cthat sounds pretty cool\u201d, and that\u2019s how she got involved with Japan. She really enjoyed it and had so much fun with it.\n\nAfter one summer, she decided to pursue her ESL endorsements. She was thinking ahead that she could teach ESL at the high school level at some point down the road. One summer as she was getting ready to go back to Japan, she knew that the ELL teacher at Hastings High would be leaving that summer, even though she had not filed her resignation letter. Mrs. Teetor took some steps before the other teacher quit. She let the school know that she was interested in the position. The teacher did end up leaving and she received a phone call asking if she was interested in the ELL position and she said \u201cYes\u201d. This is how she moved from physical education to ELL. Japan really peaked her interest working with foreign kids.\n\nShe is happy with how much ESL/ELL has evolved over the years, especially since she saw there was not a lot of curriculum that existed. The number of students has changed over the years. The program development has come a long way. There was curriculum that really existed. They were fortunate when they were able to find books related to ELL/ESL. Now there are whole curriculums that one can use. That has been an advancement of ELL programs. It is like all other curriculums in schools such as science where you have books, notebooks and a foundation to use. You start at the foundational levels and move through the different stages of it. It has been one of the biggest tools available so teachers don\u2019t have to go out and make their own material.\n\nShe describes the program at Hastings Senior High School. She gets all different levels of ESL students in each class period. She explains that in an ideal world, students are grouped by their level such as all level 1 students are together, level 2 are together, and so forth. Unfortunately, she doesn\u2019t have that luxury at the high school. She works with each level of students individually so each group of students can be differentiated as needed. She splits the groups up between her and Mrs. Brenneman, the para educator, to help each leveled group. The program at HHS is not a program that is like those implemented in other schools. The program isn\u2019t a dual language or other type. They just work based on the situation they have or a melting pot as she states. She is very proud of the graduation rate that has increased. If the kids start with the program, they tend to finish with the program unless they move away. She is proud that the ELL students have been able to take all the required classes or core classes needed to graduate. Even though they might not have a high level of English, \u201cthey do pretty well\u201d. Even though teachers provide differentiation, they learn all the same material as regular students. The students are able to get into the classroom right away. This is good for them since they can get \u201creal world\u201d experience and immerse themselves in the culture and listen to how students talk. No one ever follows grammar rules when the speak.\n\nMrs. Teetor mentions that students have to take a test to see if they need ESL services based on responses on intake forms when transferring into the district. She uses the newly implemented ELPA to screen prospective and current students who might or are using ESL services to measure their level of English. Newly arriving students fill out a questionnaire that askes the language they spoke first, what language is spoken primarily at home, and what language they want to be communicated with. If any of these are not English, they need to be tested. Even though a student knows English, they still have to take the test if their language spoken at home is not English. She uses a computer screener test. Anyone that is four (4) or above, they do not need to be in the program but anything below that, students should be enrolled in ESL/ELL. Things are done differently at the elementary level compared to the high school level.\n\nMrs. Teetor works closely with other teachers. She also likes to know what the teachers are teaching so she can meet the needs of students such as preparing a presentation or report. With American History, the students have no background especially with the foreign students. American history pertains to the United States. Math is math, science is science, these things are the same all the way across cultures. She enjoys how things are taught at HHS. Students are in ELL for at least 2 class periods. She tells us about an example student who doesn\u2019t speak a lot of but is very bright. Looking at her transcripts, she is a very well-rounded person. She has taken courses in psychology to advanced math. She was top of her class before moving. This student is \u201cbrilliant\u201d, according to Mrs. Teetor. She sees how this student can feel out of place due to the language barrier. She sees another barrier with math leaning towards story-problems. It intimidates students since it involves reading instead of involving direct math problems. What is truly moving is that she truly advocates for students to get them in the regular classroom where they will have to think, perform in the real thing. She knows it will be hard but it would be a \u201cdisservice\u201d if she does not.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t faced any teachers who have rejected or negated students. This at least hasn\u2019t occurred during her time her but she says that \u201cit might have happened before I started.\u201d She believes this hasn\u2019t happened because of her strong personality and she knows the teachers will be supportive at Hastings Senior High School. She hopes that the next person who replaces her will continue on standing up for the students. She also knows which teachers will be best for her students and she know the teachers who will not be a good fit. She moves students as necessary to put them in the right classrooms. She would rather do something else with the student if the teacher is not a good fit for the students. For a new teacher, this is something that he or she will not know and this will take time to figure out. She is hopeful the other teacher will be the best advocate for the ESL students.\n\nShe has great advice for new ESL teachers especially for the teacher replacing her. The best advice would be just to have fun with these students. They do need to learn but also everything is not so rigid that they can\u2019t enjoy. Simply cramming information gets them discouraged. It has been interested and fun for them to know. Everyone has some kid within each other. We need to promote this with the kids. She gets a lot out of the kids when they have fun. If they are sitting bored, they are not going anywhere. This is her overall advice.\n\nThank you, Mrs. Teetor for allowing me to interview you. It was such a great insight of ESL and very helpful for me for my future career as an ESL Teacher. I wish you the best in luck with retirement and hope to hear about your adventures in Japan! Cheers!\n\nA podcast of this will be available on my SoundCloud page soon!", "label": "personal"}

He has come a long way from living in Wyoming to going to school in Nebraska. He decided to take a different route and packed his things and moved to Los Angeles. I am really excited for the great things he is doing to become \"\"different\"\" and not living a normal life. He tells us about his journey and some tips to do more in life. I see great things for you Jack!\n\nPablo: Jack tell me about yourself?\n\nJack: Where to start? My name is Jack Corbett, 22 years old. I am from Madison, WI. I've always been a kid who has been in love with sports his whole life. The only thing I really wanted to do was to play football in NFL. That all changed when I got a concussion after my third year in college playing football. Things really changed after this. The concussion was very eye opening for me. I felt so messed up and out if it. I decided to take another route after football.\n\nP: What gave you that spark to get you into music?\n\nJ: When I was in high school I took a Hip-Hop class studies. I did a freestyle rap in class on the spot. Alongside I had used a beat production program, also referred as a digital audio workstation. Everyone had to present and the class had to pick their favorite beat that they liked. They ended up choosing mine. Everyone really seemed to love it! It got me super pumped. The feedback I got was good. Music is about impressing your fans. Might as well do it and I just love it. That\u2019s simply how it is. At first when starting out, I did not take music production seriously. I had always wanted to be different in how I wanted my life to be \u201cHow could I be different from the typical 9 to 5 lifestyle?\u201d Music was the way to go to do this. I turned this around and I created an independent record label, [NAME?] Records.\n\nJ: I started modeling when I got to to Los Angeles. I decided to do an open call audition for Maverick Modeling in LA. After I had done my audtion, they were interested in me but I needed to fix a few things to get things going. They wanted me to get more in shape. I had to workout quite a bit and check in with them every week for 4 weeks. Then it really worked out.\n\nP: What kind of modeling or related jobs have you had so far?\n\nJ: Oh, man! I've had a few jobs so far! I've been doing stuff with H&M, commercials, print & digital publications and some things in YouTube. Everything counts! I've had so much fun!\n\nP: How did you build contacts and/or clients?\n\nJ: The agency handles modeling projects (business aspect) for me to do. I hired a photographer that I met through a few friends. [She] is from London. I have met people from back home. You meet so many people in LA. Making beats, you get to know other people as well. I have met with a new group of rappers called FRIO. I have also made friends with Ponts De Leon. He is really making it out here. I got to hangout in his studio. Then I checked out Altrium Sudios and met label executive, Quincy Howard. I've been back there a few times with some rapper friends and Quincy has been there every time. Through meeting him and liking my vibe. I got an interview to be an intern. Today is my third day here. I am really loving every minute of it I'm grateful for all of the people I've met so far.\n\nP: What was the biggest challenge moving to this new place that you call home?\n\nJ: My biggest challenge would be financials. Everything out here is just much more expensive in every aspect Getting to LA was something else I rode for 30 hours in about 2 days. I had around 10 hours of rest before I had to start my new job Monday morning. Now I have a car. I didn\u2019t have a car for six months. I made it though LA was a bit shocking for me. It was over stimulating to be here at first. It's just different from what I was used to.\n\nP: What gave you the motivation to stay with it?\n\nJ: There would be a lot of days just sitting in your room. It is really hard to stay motivated. I love producing music! Sometimes I would be bored out of my mind not being able to show anyone my beats. It is seriously a good time even if I am by myself. At the same time, It is addicting like a video game. Sometimes I can't stop. As you get better, it is all about time. More people start to notice once you start getting better. I have so much more fun when I feel confident that I am getting better.\n\nP: Did you have any doubts in your mind that you were not going to be successful?\n\nJ: Everyone has lots of ups and down that they face. You never know when something crazy might happen!? A variety of things can make you question yourself. Things like when no one is buying your beats or not getting calls for audtions. Football has taught me to work hard. I just don't give up! I can't. .\"", "label": "personal"}

She uses a computer screener test. Anyone that is four (4) or above, they do not need to be in the program but anything below that, students should be enrolled in ESL/ELL. Things are done differently at the elementary level compared to the high school level.\n\nMrs. Teetor works closely with other teachers. She also likes to know what the teachers are teaching so she can meet the needs of students such as preparing a presentation or report. With American History, the students have no background especially with the foreign students. American history pertains to the United States. Math is math, science is science, these things are the same all the way across cultures. She enjoys how things are taught at HHS. Students are in ELL for at least 2 class periods. She tells us about an example student who doesn\u2019t speak a lot of but is very bright. Looking at her transcripts, she is a very well-rounded person. She has taken courses in psychology to advanced math. She was top of her class before moving. This student is \u201cbrilliant\u201d, according to Mrs. Teetor. She sees how this student can feel out of place due to the language barrier. She sees another barrier with math leaning towards story-problems. It intimidates students since it involves reading instead of involving direct math problems. What is truly moving is that she truly advocates for students to get them in the regular classroom where they will have to think, perform in the real thing. She knows it will be hard but it would be a \u201cdisservice\u201d if she does not.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t faced any teachers who have rejected or negated students. This at least hasn\u2019t occurred during her time her but she says that \u201cit might have happened before I started.\u201d She believes this hasn\u2019t happened because of her strong personality and she knows the teachers will be supportive at Hastings Senior High School. She hopes that the next person who replaces her will continue on standing up for the students. She also knows which teachers will be best for her students and she know the teachers who will not be a good fit. She moves students as necessary to put them in the right classrooms. She would rather do something else with the student if the teacher is not a good fit for the students. For a new teacher, this is something that he or she will not know and this will take time to figure out. She is hopeful the other teacher will be the best advocate for the ESL students.\n\nShe has great advice for new ESL teachers especially for the teacher replacing her. The best advice would be just to have fun with these students. They do need to learn but also everything is not so rigid that they can\u2019t enjoy. Simply cramming information gets them discouraged. It has been interested and fun for them to know. Everyone has some kid within each other. We need to promote this with the kids. She gets a lot out of the kids when they have fun. If they are sitting bored, they are not going anywhere. This is her overall advice.\n\nThank you, Mrs. Teetor for allowing me to interview you. It was such a great insight of ESL and very helpful for me for my future career as an ESL Teacher. I wish you the best in luck with retirement and hope to hear about your adventures in Japan!

Getting the insights from another teacher lets you have a feeling of what its like to be in the classroom. Enjoy the interview! I will have the audio podcast available soon! Click here to download a copy of the document to your device.\n\nDenise Teetor: ESL at Hastings Senior High School\n\nInterviewed by\n\nPablo MORALES GARCIA\n\nMrs. Denise Teetor is an English as a Second Language Teacher at Hastings Senior High School in Hastings Nebraska. She has been teaching at the high school for more than 30 years. She has quite a different perspective of the world since she has traveled outside of the United States plenty of times. She has seen so many changes in ESL over the years. She has quite the story to tell in which she becomes the ESL teacher she is today.\n\nMrs. Teetor was not an ESL teacher from the beginning. She use to teach physical education and coach for a long time. She decided to pursue a different area of teaching and left behind being an PE teacher and decided to teach English in Japan. She wanted to do something different with her time during the summers instead of wasting it. She saw an advertisement to teach in Japan for six weeks and thought \u201cthat sounds pretty cool\u201d, and that\u2019s how she got involved with Japan. She really enjoyed it and had so much fun with it.\n\nAfter one summer, she decided to pursue her ESL endorsements. She was thinking ahead that she could teach ESL at the high school level at some point down the road. One summer as she was getting ready to go back to Japan, she knew that the ELL teacher at Hastings High would be leaving that summer, even though she had not filed her resignation letter. Mrs. Teetor took some steps before the other teacher quit. She let the school know that she was interested in the position. The teacher did end up leaving and she received a phone call asking if she was interested in the ELL position and she said \u201cYes\u201d. This is how she moved from physical education to ELL. Japan really peaked her interest working with foreign kids.\n\nShe is happy with how much ESL/ELL has evolved over the years, especially since she saw there was not a lot of curriculum that existed. The number of students has changed over the years. The program development has come a long way. There was curriculum that really existed. They were fortunate when they were able to find books related to ELL/ESL. Now there are whole curriculums that one can use. That has been an advancement of ELL programs. It is like all other curriculums in schools such as science where you have books, notebooks and a foundation to use. You start at the foundational levels and move through the different stages of it. It has been one of the biggest tools available so teachers don\u2019t have to go out and make their own material.\n\nShe describes the program at Hastings Senior High School. She gets all different levels of ESL students in each class period. She explains that in an ideal world, students are grouped by their level such as all level 1 students are together, level 2 are together, and so forth. Unfortunately, she doesn\u2019t have that luxury at the high school. She works with each level of students individually so each group of students can be differentiated as needed. She splits the groups up between her and Mrs. Brenneman, the para educator, to help each leveled group. The program at HHS is not a program that is like those implemented in other schools. The program isn\u2019t a dual language or other type. They just work based on the situation they have or a melting pot as she states. She is very proud of the graduation rate that has increased. If the kids start with the program, they tend to finish with the program unless they move away. She is proud that the ELL students have been able to take all the required classes or core classes needed to graduate. Even though they might not have a high level of English, \u201cthey do pretty well\u201d. Even though teachers provide differentiation, they learn all the same material as regular students. The students are able to get into the classroom right away. This is good for them since they can get \u201creal world\u201d experience and immerse themselves in the culture and listen to how students talk. No one ever follows grammar rules when the speak.\n\nMrs. Teetor mentions that students have to take a test to see if they need ESL services based on responses on intake forms when transferring into the district. She uses the newly implemented ELPA to screen prospective and current students who might or are using ESL services to measure their level of English. Newly arriving students fill out a questionnaire that askes the language they spoke first, what language is spoken primarily at home, and what language they want to be communicated with. If any of these are not English, they need to be tested. Even though a student knows English, they still have to take the test if their language spoken at home is not English. She uses a computer screener test. Anyone that is four (4) or above, they do not need to be in the program but anything below that, students should be enrolled in ESL/ELL. Things are done differently at the elementary level compared to the high school level.\n\nMrs. Teetor works closely with other teachers.

These posts will be interactive on my website (https://lifeofpablo.com) . I am in the process of rebuilding my website so stay tuned.\n\nHere I am in South Korea getting a snack at a convenience store. Everytime I go to one, I reflect on convenience stores back in the United States. Convenience stores in the United States are usually gas stations at the same time. Living in California you see convenience stores as standalone locations more often. Convenience stores back home get a bad wrap because they sell not so healthy food or are simply over priced. It's not so much in Korea. Yes, there are things that are overpriced but not as bad as you would see in the United States. Korean Convenience Stores are a whole different experience..\n\n\u2665\ufe0fKOREA IS LIVING IN THE FUTURE\u2665\ufe0f\n\nCommon convenience stores are GS25, Nice to CU and 7/11. They are all over the place. It's hard not to walk from one corner of a block to another corner of the same block without passing a convenience store. This is pretty consistent in most of Korea. The cities of Seoul and Chuncheon are good examples. Two or three years since the pandemic, many did stay open pretty late or open 24 hours. They are just there whenever you need something. You can buy a snack, a beer (or many), toiletries and more! I've even found socks after my shoes got soaked in the rain. Prices are not overly expensive taking in consideration that the exchange rate between USD and WON are in the favor of the American consumer such as myself.\n\nThe experience at every convenience store is different. You never know what you'll find. I'm not sure how it is decided on what is carried in each store. I do love the element of surprise.\n\nKorean Convenience Stores will fill the void in many aspects of life. They are considered important in Korean Culture and Socialization. You'll often find tables inside and outside of the store. I find it hard to find a normal bar establishment. Even if I did find a bar, it could be expensive or hard to get into. Convenience Stores are a meeting point to socialize especially if there is seating available at the location you visit. I really enjoy getting a beer or a few with friends and just talk about our day, our hopes & desires, and just having tipy conversations. I've had some really deep moments here with others. One of my favorite moments was finding a convenience store in a large park and making my ramen right then and there!\n\nWhat really shocked me was the Seoul WorldCup Stadium when I went to a soccer match. There I found a GS25 with prices similar to one you find on a random street.\n\nOverall, I'm happy with convenience stores here! I sure will miss them!\n\nI will share this information in a lesson in the near future with others.\n\nHere are my favorite items I get from the convenience store:\n\nSmall pack of coffee\n\nA cup of ice - use it for any drink you need to make cold (or colder.)\n\nGimbap\n\nBeer\n\nRam\n\nSnacks such as fried\n\nRamen\n\nWhat is nice about convenience stores is being able to cook instant ramen in-store seconds right after you buy it.\n\nSnacks\n\nThere are so many options.

{"title": "My #introduction on Mastodon", "url": "https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/my-introduction-on-mastodon", "content": "My #introduction on Mastodon\n\nThis post was written in English (en_US).\n\nPablo joined Mastodon!\n\nWe all know the news of the fire storm that is happening with Twitter and lighter fluid known as Elon Musk is throwing at it.\n\nMastodon is a social media service that is free. It pretty much acts like twitter with the same functionality but the name of the functions are named differently.\n\npost \"toots\" (instead of tweets),\n\nfollow other people and organizations,\n\nfavorite (like) and\n\nboost (retweet) posts from other people.\n\nI decided to join the community and so far I am enjoying it. When I mean joined, I actually created my own Mastodon instance on my server. More on this later. So for I am loving the decentralized platform and being able to control various aspects to it. My first experience with federation was the use of OwnCloud and its variants such as NextCloud. This concept has been around for quite some time.\n\nI chose to host my own instance because I like my domain (lifeofpablo.com) and it gave me an opportunity to learn how to manage an instance and learn how to be a user as well. It's been a great experience. If there is question or something I don't know I visit the Mastodon Documentation . This where the instructions are located to install your own instance. The key to installing your own instance is making sure Node.js is setup correctly on your server. It's pretty straight forward.\n\nMy Instance Setup:\n\nBack-End Domain Setup: https://social.lifeofpablo.com\n\nMy username pablo [at] pablolifeofpablo.com Please follow me \ud83d\ude00\n\nInstall using Mastodon Documentation Front-End Single User Mode (Just Me) At this time no registrations (Please follow me!)\n\nI love that i can use my main domain as the communicative user domain.\n\nGoals:\n\nBackground I would like to use Mastodon and the oAuth (used for login system) as a way to build apps, not necessarily clients. These apps would be an extension to my Mastodon instance. I'd use the login system to login to these apps to pull and use data. Steps Use Mastodon as backend for authentication\n\nBuild Node.js app using Mastodon (oAuth) as a login system for an internal app. A tutorial I found for good foundation\n\nCreate a dashboard where I can see metrics, trends, push system wide notifications, server maintenance, etc. Essentially a backend management.\n\nMove many of the administration features to the dashboard with the option of allowing features to be available.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt's been great getting to use Mastodon on the server-side and as a user. I see a great future for Mastodon and other decentralized, federated services (and other terminology) out there.\n\nI'm sure my goals/vision will grow on what I can do with my Mastodon instance. I know I will eventually migrate and upgrade server resources such as RAM, storage, processing power. I also need to make sure I concious about how much energy and being carbon neutral or carbon negative.\n\nIntroduction Post", "label": "personal"}

These posts will be interactive on my website (https://lifeofpablo.com) . I am in the process of rebuilding my website so stayed tuned.\n\nMy name is Pablo Morales. I used to teach within Omaha Public Schools but now I teach in Sacramento, CA. I still teach French & Spanish to middle schoolers.\n\nI have always been a fan of public transportation! Within the United States, commuting to work seems painfully dreadful. We are a nation dominated by cars and bad policies. Our public transportation infrastructure is not good for a very \u201cdeveloped\u201d country. Our roads are suffering, and everything else in-between isn\u2019t pleasant either. This isn't the case in South Korea. I'm only a week or so in since arriving in South Korea. I am absolutely M-I-N-D blown on what I am seeing and hearing.. My brain can't handle this!\n\nCommuting in Seoul, Korea is not about trying to catch your bus or train, you are there for the experience of being in a station. You're probably wondering, \"Pablo, Isn't the topic over public transportation\u2026.you know boring?\" I say, \"Absolutely Not!\" I've been to multiple cities who don't even come close to the Korean experience of public transportation. My favorite part about using the Seoul Metro System is that you get to hear all the cute and relaxing rings and jingles offered at all metro stations and some bus stations.\n\nCommuting is hard on the body when traveling far. It's hot and humid out, or you're just simply tired. Those little jingles give you a glimmer of hope that you are getting closer to your final destination. You stay motivated instead of only hearing the usual \"This train is departing.\" or departing. It brightens the mood. My two favorite jingles or sounds are: The Trumpet Link A steelpan Link Do you see what I mean? It definitely made me smile. Everyone seems so happy. I knew traveling within Seoul was going to be fun but who knew these little jingles are what make the experience of the metro in Seoul.\n\nHere is a handpicked few of my favorite jingles. Not all are in circulation at the moment.\n\nLink\n\nLink\n\nBeing a minority in the US and still being a minority in South Korea.\n\nSomeone who speaks 3 different languages.

Education has been ingrained in me I was the first to graduate in my family from university. I studied to become a public school teacher. I became a public school teacher early in my career. I taught during the COVID pandemic during my first year of becoming a public school teacher.\n\nPublic school education is important to me.\n\nIt makes me sad to see what Nebraska, my home state, has become regarding public education. Now that I live in California, I feel, indirectly, I am standing on the sidelines seeing how my home-sate wants to divert public funds or public taxes to fund private institutions. We live in a time where we can't properly fund, nor respect our own public schools across the nation. The de-funding public schools has been in the works as far back as the 1980s. Other efforts happened before this as well. This has been most predominantly since the Reagan Administration. The Reagan Administration slashed funding for public education across the board.\n\nIt's embarrassing we are trying to divert money from a great public school system from the State of Nebraska as it ranks one of the highest in the nation. I myself am a product of a Nebraska Public Education. We need to fix the issues happening, not make the problems worse.\n\nWhy should we fund private institutions? Why should we fund religious public institutions? Shouldn't we have separation of church and state? Public funds should stay in public schools. It's like they are trying to make a problem worse? Why keep under funding the public school system?\n\nNone of the private schools in my hometown, offered the subjects I was interested. I lived not too far from a Catholic school. They offered the \"bare minimum.\" They didn't offer other world languages beyond Spanish. They didn't offer auto mechanics or other trades (attending trade school is just as important as university. This is discussion for another time.) What is the likelihood of them expanding their programs?\n\nMany counties in Nebraska don't even have private institutions. How is the state going to give private institutions money to education students when the facilities don't exist? Here's a news report\n\nPrivate education will increase inequality.\n\nPublic schools have been there for everyone. No matter your socioeconomic status. It was there for me. Public schools are there to help the most disadvantaged.\n\nI agree, with the phrase, \"Society is cheaping out on the kids\" as written by Tracy Durnell, \"We must fight the privatisation of school to provide racial equity, class mobility, and teaching reality instead of \u2018alternative facts.\" We need to invest in students and not let them down.\n\nHow the State Currently get funding\n\nNebraska Public Media does a great job, visually of reporting how schools are funded in Nebraska.\n\nGraphic from Nebraska Public Media: Nebraska relies heavily on property taxes to fund its public schools, compared to other states. (Graphic courtesy of OpenSky Policy Institute, uses 2019-2020 data\n\nMore state funding on the way for public schools in Nebraska\n\nAdding funding to public schools is only one piece of the puzzle, we need to also address the systems, bureaucracies, institutions, and bad polices that exist, past and present.\n\nI don't like to be cynical, I am scared what is coming. People need to become informed in what is happening in their community. People need to read the bills introduced in their respective level of government.

In this example I will be using IndieAuth as our provider using a very minimal configuration.\n\nThis tutorial assumes you have prior knowledge of using a linux server such as Debian.

Every request is checked by VP to ensure that it is valid.\n\nVP can send the visitor's email, name and other information which the IdP provides (including access tokens) to the web application as HTTP headers. VP can be used to replace application user management entirely. In our case, we are passing an HTTP header with your domain to sign into sites that support indieauth protocol.\n\nAn example of an HTTP header being passed is my domain, https://lifeofpablo.com.\n\nThings you'll need/prepare:\n\nA linux server with a public IP address with hosting and SSL Debian will be used here but any of the common distros will work Certbot is an easy solution to get SSL certifcate for https://\n\nGo Language (to compile vouch-proxy)\n\nVouch Proxy\n\nMake sure your website is setup for use with the Indieauth protocol.\n\nNginx Web Server\n\nDigital Ocean has a good guide if you need to learn how to setup virtual blocks in nginx.\n\nDownload/Install Vouch Proxy from Github\n\nMake sure to have Go Lang installed. Follow the instructions for your operating system. In my case I am using debian.\n\nDownload Vouch Proxy from it's Github repository.\n\n$ git clone https://github.com/vouch/vouch-proxy.git $ cd vouch-proxy $ ./do.sh goget $ ./do.sh build\n\nVouch Proxy Nginx Virtual Block\n\nLet's go ahead and create a virtual block to proxy Vouch Proxy.\n\nserver { server_name vouch.domain.com; location / { proxy_set_header Host $http_host ; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https; proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9090; } }\n\nLet's go ahead and create a virtual block for a regular nginx website site or edit an existing virtual block. This is the website/service that you will protect with Vouch Proxy.\n\nIn this example I am using a php web app. If you a non php site site to work you can remove this location block and and edit it to your needs.\n\nVouch Proxy config with Indieauth.com as a service provider.\n\nModify your config.yml\n\nThis will get you going, I have added some of my personal settings such as public access. Public access allows people to access your \"protected app\" without needing to login until you need them to login. Here are some options in how you can allow people to use your app. It is important to align the config in the config.yml file. Even an extra space can cause Vouch Proxy to fail. More on that in the next section.\n\nOptions\n\nYou can allow public access to the site but only allow everyone the option to sign into the website with a basic PHP script or use the corresponding http_header to use the website/web app to authenticate . Comment out or delete the line, \"allowAllUsers: true\" and include the line,\" publicAccess: true\" .\n\nYou can allow public access to the site but only allow certain people, (or in this case, domains) actually sign into the website. Comment out or delete the line, \"allowAllUsers: true\" and include the line,\" publicAccess: true\" .\n\nYou can force everyone to sign in before seeing the website but still allow everyone to access the website. Include the \"allowAllUsers: true\" and comment out or delete the line,,\" publicAccess: true\" .\n\n\n\nvouch: logLevel: debug listen: 0.0 .0 .0 port: 9090 allowAllUsers: true cookie: secure: false domain: lifeofpablo.com publicAccess: true oauth: provider: indieauth client_id: https://lifeofpablo.com auth_url: https://indieauth.com/auth callback_url: https://auth.lifeofpablo.com/auth\n\nRun/test your Vouch Proxy configuration.\n\nRun the following command\n\nnohup ./vouch-proxy -loglevel debug > vouch.log 2>&1 &\n\nIt should display a process ID (PID)\n\n[1] 53310\n\nHit enter. If no error or exit code displays, Vouch proxy is running!\n\nIf there is an error, it will exit such as the example below.\n\n[1]+ Exit 126 nohup ./vouch-proxy -loglevel debug > vouch.log 2>&1\n\nIf there is an error, make sure your there is not weird spacing or errors in the configuration. If you are sure that you have the information correct, use the examples provided by Vouch Proxy and copy and paste the example to get the formatting correct. Adjust the configuration as needed to match your needs.\n\nNginx Virtual block protected by Vouch Proxy\n\nserver { listen 80 ; listen [::]: 80 ; root /root/to/web/directory; index index.php index.html; server_name secretapp.example.com; location / { try_files $uri $uri / /index.php $is_args $args ; } client_max_body_size 100m ; location ~* \\.php$ { try_files $uri = 404 ; fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.2-fpm.sock; include fastcgi.conf; fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\\.php)(/.+)$ ; fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root $fastcgi_script_name ; fastcgi_param REMOTE_USER $auth_user ; } auth_request /vouch-validate; location = /vouch-validate { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9090/validate; proxy_set_header Content-Length \"\" ; proxy_set_header Host $http_host ; proxy_set_header Remote-User $auth_user ; proxy_pass_request_body off ; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr ; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for ; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme ; auth_request_set $auth_resp_jwt $upstream_http_x_vouch_jwt ; auth_request_set $auth_resp_err $upstream_http_x_vouch_err ; auth_request_set $auth_resp_failcount $upstream_http_x_vouch_failcount ; } auth_request_set $auth_user $upstream_http_x_vouch_user ; location = /logout { return 302 https://vouch.domain.com/logout?url= $scheme :// $http_host ; } error_page 401 = @error401 ; location @error401 { return 302 https://vouch.domain.com/login?url=https:// $http_host $request_uri &vouch-failcount= $auth_resp_failcount &X-Vouch-Token= $auth_resp_jwt &error= $auth_resp_err ; } }\n\nEventually you will need to secure your site with SSL/TLS that makes your site use https://. More than ever, your traffic should be secure with using it as 0auth as the method used to sign in to your protected website(s).\n\nDo this after you have the server blocks working in the following section.\n\nHere is the link for Certbot for Debian. I have tested this on Debian 10 & 11. [https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=nginx&os=debianbuster](Link for Certbot)\n\nCertbot can do this for you as long as you have the subdomain in your DNS pointing to your machine and have cert bot installed. It'll add these blocks in your server blocks automatically.\n\nIt'll look similar to this . Certbot will rearrange and add a few things.\n\nserver { server_name vouch.example.com . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . listen [::]: 443 ssl; listen 443 ssl; ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/vouch.example.com/fullchain.pem; ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/vouch.example.com/privkey.pem; include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; } server { if ( $host = vouch.domain.com) { return 301 https:// $host $request_uri ; } listen 80 ; listen [::]: 80 ; server_name secretapp.example.com; return 404 ; }\n\nRepeat for every server block you'd like protect.\n\nLet's check for errors in nginx. Type the following command.\n\nsudo nginx -t\n\nYou should see something similar to this:\n\nnginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful\n\nThen restart nginx to push changes.\n\nsudo systemctl restart nginx\n\nLet's open a browser tab or window!\n\nNote: I'm using Firefox. (Preference). Any modern browser should work.\n\nDepending on your setup, you'll see a login screen or a website without login in\n\nType in the protected app' URL in the address bar Sign in with your domain (indieauth). Trigger a login later, if needed. OR Type in the protected app' URL in the address bar 2 - Trigger Login Later Trigger vouch proxy (indieauth).\n\nVoila, the protected page.\n\nHere is the home page of a Bludit CMS on subdomain acting as \"secretapp.example.com\"\n\nI will write a blog post on using it on my website and my RSS feeder. I will also go in deeper about the cookie as well.\n\nThat's it! You have setup indieauth to protect (or not your pages\n\nWant to see who's logged in?\n\nWhether you just want to see the user authenticated via the http_header or use http_header to help you authenticate into the website we can use a simple php script. We added already the other parts but here's an overview.\n\nIn your main server block, just below the line auth_request /vouch-validate; which enables the auth_request module, we added the following:\n\nauth_request_set $auth_user $upstream_http_x_vouch_user ;\n\nThis will take the HTTP header that Vouch sets, X-Vouch-User , and assign it to the nginx variable $auth_user . Then, depending on whether you use fastcgi or proxy_pass, include one of the two lines below in your server block:\n\nfastcgi_param REMOTE_USER $auth_user ; proxy_set_header Remote-User $auth_user ;\n\nThese will set an HTTP header with the value of $auth_user that your backend server can read in order to know who logged in.

I have used it one or twice through out the years. My first time being in 2015. I was so opposed or timid in the use of using Docker. I was so used to doing things the \"hard way\" otherwise known as manual install. So My friend Mani, has been showing me his Kubernetes setup and talking about Docker. I thought it was pretty rad! Just the way things flowed and how easy it is to stop and start a container. This is something he has started for a while. I hope to become well versed in this.\n\nThis leads to what is mentioned in the title of this post. I am in the process of learning to understand containers, Kubernetes, miniKube, docker and how this all ties together. I'll start with Docker and learn Kubernetes side-by-side and hope to understand. The goal is to containerize all my websites and services to keep up with the times and become a better developer.\n\nMy first successful implementation of a docker container was, wait for it..... Can you guess what it is? If you guessed Vouch Proxy! You win an cookie \ud83c\udf6a! Hooray! For the record, not a browser cookie. Those are not tasty or pleasing.\n\nIt was pretty simple once I figured out how to run the commands to adjust to my needs. I used my existing configuration file for Vouch Proxy but with some redactions. So, if you are seeing this post, or signed into my website, vouch proxy is running on docker!\n\nNext step is my website which runs on php and uses Datenstrom Yellow as the flat-file cms.\n\nI am excited for this new phase of my developer life.

I have always had an interest in taking pictures. I am one of those millennials who had a flip phone. For those who didn't have to live through this, flip phones did not have good cameras what's so ever. Phones were not all-in-one like today. So I had to bring my camera with me everywhere in my pocket or on my wrist all the time to get a good shot.\n\nPhotography has been a hobby of mine for a while. I've done it on and off throughout the years. It is a good outlet for me. It started with a point and shoot and eventually, I got nicer DSLR camera. I recently in the last two or three. years started with analog photography. Both, film photography and analog format videos. It's been fun crossing over different mediums. Photography makes me happy. I do my best to capture the moment and keep that moment alive. It is a capture of a moment of time. It's mind-blowing we can literally capture a moment and stare at it forever.\n\nIt is so much more meaningful to take it on a real camera, even if it is a simple point in shoot. It's a very intimate moment between what your capturing, the camera and most importantly - the person taking the shot.\n\nI know I'm no where being any good. I just enjoy doing this hobby. I really got to meet some cool people in the photography world. I feel proud as a teacher to have inspired one of my students to really get himself to do more photography. He has amazing shots by one-thousands times.\n\nThere are so many moments I captures that I will forever cherish. Many moments I won't show the world but maybe some day I will. Who knows? Some things are better left not reaching light.\n\nBelow are just some of my photos.

I've been eating out a bit more than I would like. I hate to say but I've been busy building new things on the web, work projects, and life overall. I'm taking a well deserved holiday soon to a place special to me in Mexico. I've been thinking how I need to cleanse and detach myself from the US food culture. I want to stay away as far from chemicals and additives. Don't get me wrong these are found in all countries, especially in processed foods.\n\nI'm excited to get some homemade food in Mexico. I'm excited for fresh ingredients from the farms and gardens in the village I am staying in. I feel that it's hard to know where your food is coming from when in the United States.\n\nThe goal is not to eat at any US-based chain fast food places or hamburgers, pizza - you know the common fast food culprits? This should be relatively easy because those are far away from the village I am staying in. Fast food has infiltrated even the most remote places. I want to indulge in so many authentic foods I don't get the chance to eat except when I am in Mexico. This is a change to reconnect with my roots, reform past relationships and find parts of me that United States culture has suppressed. Food is a good way to reconnect with lost parts of me.

I've been very fortunate to be around computers since i was three with these interactions been in school.\n\nHaving access to computers was game changing for me and has helped me. I would say I signed up for MySpace when I was ten. I know I am such a rule breaker. When I discovered personal websites, my mind exploded . . . metaphorically.\n\nCuriosity didn't kill the cat\n\nI remember when my parents upgraded from dial-up to DSL. I remember the lady at the phone company explaining all the details of the features included in our internet plan. Something that struck me was the FTP storage space. I thought, \"Wait, I can create a my website and have it hosted for free?\" This was in 2003 when I started my first personal website. I remember using basic HTML and clip art. I cringe just thinking about it. This was the stepping stone for me building and hosting websites. Using FTP was pretty advanced for an eight year old. I would stay up late just tinkering my site to make it perfect with poor HTML skills. It worked somehow?\n\nExpressing Myself\n\nI've always wanted to find ways to express myself. Since I was big into computers and tech, I figured I would use the website I built to share the things I enjoyed. I wanted to share who I was as a person. I had an idea who I was but I was still developing.\n\nInspired by others.\n\nI would look at other people who would blog and that would make me super gitty. I remember stumbling upon Matt Mullenweb back in 2003 and being inspired by him. He and many others taught me a lot about blogging. Learning by (browsing the internet) doing.\n\nBeing Resourceful.\n\nI would create new websites over the years. I couldn't afford to a pay for a website domain because I was eight years old and I wasn't going to ask my parents to spend money on something when I was more than grateful to have a computer and fast internet. I would use any free service I could until I could pay for it on my own.\n\nServices I'd use\n\nI would use a site in 2010 called Altervista where I officially used Wordpress for the first time. I made a big leap from HTML to the most popular CMS (of course I had no idea at the time). I decided this was the moment I would start expanding from a basic site to start blogging even if the posts had a few sentences. I used:\n\nAltervista\n\nDynDNS\n\nWordpress.com\n\nFreewebhosting\n\nToday\n\nOften, I really feel like that 8 year old who was discovering how to build things on the web.", "label": "personal"}

The time flew by and I made my way back home.\n\nThe last few weeks I've been reading on facial recognition. This has been a topic I've had an interest for quite some time. Our phones, our computers, and any item that had humble beginnings such as a door bell all have some form of facial recognition built in or programmed. It's weird to think about how you can unlock your phone with your face.\n\nPrivacy has become an issue with all these conveniences. Everywhere you go, your face (you as a person) is being tracked. EVERYWHERE!.\n\nSince I was traveling, I have been reading on facial recognition and the TSA\n\nAs a U.S. Citizen, I can opt out of facial recognition from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) :\n\nHere is a sign:\n\nA sign allowing U.S. citizens to opt out of facial scans.\n\nThe Experience\n\nI decided before I arrived at Los Angeles International AIrport (LAX) I decided to once I got to customs I would ask them to do a manual document check. I was already expecting them to ask me a bunch of questions. Things would either be easy or hard. I didn't want them running my face across different databases. Why should I give them more of my biometrics when they have this already?\n\nWhen I arrived at the he Customs and Border Protection Agent booth/station, I told them that I didn't want to my photo taken for facial scan. The agent went off on me. It seemed that he was shaming me for exercising my right to not have my face scanned. There were signs all over saying to inform an agent if I don't want my face scanned. This is exactly what I requested.\n\nThe Agent asked me the following questions\n\n\"Why are you doing this?\"\n\n\"Why are you making this more complicated?\"\n\n\"Do you see how many people have gone through starting this conversation?\"\n\n\"Do you that we have your facial biometics because you have a passport and driver's license?\"\n\n\"Any identity document you have is a biometric?'\n\nIt seemed that I was inconveniencing them for doing their job and providing a manual document check as my right to not to have my face scanned and verified across databases. The thing that made me mad was the intimidation tactics it seemed the agent was trying to get across. I didn't really appreciate that at all.\n\nMany of the questions the agent asked also came from the CBP Declaration Form 6059B.\n\nI was also asked where in Mexico I went, what other times I left the United States. I'm a person who provided to the point answers when asked. It's generally a good idea to provide answers not too short or answers too long either. They are law enforcement, you don't want to give unnecessary information to them either.\n\nI stood my ground. Eventually this whole ordeal was over and I moved on to collect my luggage.\n\nThe Issues\n\nThe issue I have is not the government has my biometrics, the problem I have is the how and who handles my data. This concern frightens me more when third-party companies or private companies are contracted by the government to handle this data. When other entities get involved,\n\nHow much control does a citizen have?\n\nHow much does the government actually follow up what these companies are doing with our data?\n\nHow is this information secured from hackers and kept safe?\n\nI felt so violated when I had to verify my identity for ID.me to access my IRS (Internal Revenue Service) to access my tax transcript. Why should a third party service be put in the way of accessing my government tax transcript? Why is identity verification being outsourced to a private company? The service wasn't really great at all. . It's so flawed for people of color.\n\nWe're in a Police Lineup", "label": "personal"}

One food item that always comes back with me is tlayudas.\n\nThis is a Tlayuda\n\nA tlayuda is a big tortilla tortilla that is a staple food in Oaxaca made out of corn and water. They are huge and twice the size of my head. These are no regular tortillas. This has been a food I've been eating since I was a young kid with my parents, grandparents, other relatives, and many friends. Even in moments of low funds, I have always been able to rely on these to meet my needs.\n\nOften times the tlayuda itself is the plate which you eat on. What I mean by this that often times you don't use an actual plate on the table to hold your tlayuda but the tlayuda is your plate.\n\nHow It's Eaten?\n\nThere are many ways on how you eat one but here are the ways I eat them:\n\nYou rip the tlayuda piece by piece until there is no more\n\nYou can roll it up and just starting biting into it.\n\nWhat's on this Tlayuda\n\nThis one is a simple Tlayuda. For the toppings, I used:\n\nTlayuda as the base\n\nHomemade refried beans\n\nQuesillo (Oaxacan String Cheese)\n\nChapulines (Grasshoppers). Yes, you read that correctly.\n\nWhy I Chose These Ingredients\n\nI brought back plenty of these ingredients with me from Oaxaca since I don't get to have these often or it's hard to find around here. Even when i do find them here, it doesn't have the same taste or the ingredients are old. I'm trying to eat as much of them as fast as I can.\n\nI love quesillo. Even though my body I don't agree with dairy much but quesillo is something that I never have a problem with. It probably the way it's cultured.\n\nI also haven't had much of an appetite the last few days and I haven't been craving much meat either. The chapulines provide me a substantial amount of protein and nutrients. It's common in Oaxaca to go multiple meals without eating meat. There are times where I don't eat meat for weeks at a time\n\nKeep Connected with My Roots\n\nAs a first generation Mexican-American and Oaxacan, food is important to me to help me stay connected with my culture.", "label": "personal"}

I've gone hiking here for many years since I was a kid. Exploring here gives me a sense of reconnecting with my roots. It let's me explore with no limit to what I can find or experience. It helps me be in the moment. This garden to me is infinite.\n\nIt's a beautiful place to walk through when everything is green or dry. I really admire the beauty of it. There are so many native plants surrounding me. I see the cactus, the native grasses, the carrizo (giant reed) and any plant offspring that falls on the ground.\n\nThere are so many fields of crops as well. Nature and agriculture co-existing. It's weird how well they blend in with each other.\n\nMy favorite time to enjoy the garden is sun down. All the colors are breath taking to watch and see how day becomes night. There are fun activities you can do at night time during a hike such as picking azucenas (lilies).\n\nThis is the land my ancestors lived on. I've lived on this land as well. I must continue to visit and reconnect with the people before me.\n\nNature is so beautiful. We must protect it at all costs.", "label": "personal"}

I moved away two years ago from my home state of Nebraska to the state of California. I believe it's safe to say that California is home. I've done a lot growing as a person. I am not the same person who was when I left Nebraska. I'm still growing.\n\nWhy Leave Nebraska?\n\nNebraska will forever be home. It was the place that saw me grow up. I got a great public education. It taught me how to say, \"Ope!\" and how to be a Midwestern Mexican Guy.\n\nIt's been in my mind for a while to leave. That, \"for a while\" thought has been in my mind since I was a kid. At a young age I had all these dreams and ambitions to live in various places throughout the world.\n\nI was very fortune to have visited different places in high school and in university, I got to live in France through study abroad. These experiences solidified my need to venture off more throughout the United States. Traveling abroad since I was a young kid has helped me realize there are so many great things outside of Nebraska. It's funny because I joke around how I've traveled more outside the country than in the country I reside in. I am very fortunate to have lived in Mexico for extended periods of time throughout my life.\n\nPreventing Resentment and Repeating the Mistakes of Others\n\nI've always craved so much more than the simple life back home. I didn't want to feel trapped and become resentful for lack of trying to live in and experiencing new things in new places. I see many of the people who I grew up with and reflect on my own self. I didn't want that lifestyle. So many people who I had wished had left Nebraska for greener pastures didn't leave. I didn't want to be trapped.\n\nQuestioning the Environment\n\nI've always questioned my environment. These are the questions:\n\nWhy don't we have public transportation?\n\nWhy is it weird to walk on the sidewalk in such a walk-able town?\n\nWhy are people of afraid of good change?\n\nWhy don't we think of the needs of young people who will lead the future?\n\nMy Lifestyle\n\nBeing Nebraska wasn't fitting my lifestyle anymore. I had outgrown the town of 25,000 habitants. Growing up, I never really accepted myself as a person in various degrees. I tolerated myself at best. I was smiling without actually being happy. This fa\u00e7ade of being known as, \"the guy who always has a smile on his face,\" was getting old. It was draining me for years. I truly wasn't happy. No one would ever guess that. I lost myself as an individual and I also lost who I wanted to become as individual. Looking at myself in the mirror was not a true reflection of me. I just didn't feel like anything was truly going for me. There are so many things I wish I would have addressed sooner.\n\nLeaving Nebraska was going to happen sooner than later. I had a friend nudge me a few years back to finally do it. I am grateful he nudged me enough that I felt it in my ribs.\n\nCalifornia\n\nI'm Happier as a Person\n\nI'm living in California now for two years now. Time flies!\n\nI'm a lot happier here.

Do you think about how as a person, it's hard to think about times you are truly by yourself? This has been something that has been on my mind a lot.\n\nToday, I went on a run today and drank a matcha latte at a coffee shop. It was nice just being in my thoughts and I appreciated being with myself and only myself. My mind was saying (or saying to itself?) \"This is relaxing!\"\n\nThis initiated me to start refecting on the activites I've done this year so far. I went through my phone's photo's apps, looked at my check-ins and any other history I had available. hen I started filtering out all things I've done alone and not with people. This is what I was able to recall the things I did or initiated by myself.\n\nSitting in a Coffee\n\nGoing to Noisebridge (San Francisco)\n\nGoing swimming in the river\n\nSeeing two films\n\nA few day trips?\n\nI ask myself the following questions: \"Am I not having a enough solo time?\" or \"Am I having a healthy amount of solo time?\"\n\nOften times, activites outside of home involve people in my day to day. I am not complaining about having a social circle. I just wondering for myself, \"What is a good balance?\", between activities that social and alone?\n\nAm I afraid to venture out on my own? Probably? Being at home is comfortable and I feel safe. Does my lack of knowing what is happening in my community add to this? More than likely. Does becoming a home body also play a roll.

{"title": "1000 Albums in 1000 Days", "url": "https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/one-thousand-albums-in-one-thousand-days", "content": "Sunday Morning Adventure\n\nIt was a Sunday and I was simply looking for something to do on an afternoon. Yesterday, I went to the bookstore yesterday in a long time. Going to the bookstore is a fun place to simply browse with no goal. You can simply just look and hope that something catches your eye. Oh boy! did a few things catch my eye! One book I really want to talk about is 1000 Record Covers by Michael Ors. Just as the title describes, it is a book showing different record covers. The book organized by decade (50s, 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s). It's a simple book with an record covers and a information about the record album. I inititally hesitated in purchasing this book. Then, I started thinking about my taste in music.\n\nBreaking The Loop\n\nI've been stuck in this loop of music where I listen to the same stuff over and over and over again. It's been something I've been disatisfied with myself for a while. I purchased this book not just look at all the vintage record covers, I want to expand my taste in music. So I decided to challenge myself to break away from comfortability by listening to music I don't listen to normally or never thought to listen.\n\nI am using this book as a guide to find new music. Streaming services ideally make it easy to discover new music. At the same time it seems overwhelming and distracting to even know what to discover. A book helps provide content without other distractions popping out of every direction. I also want to learn more music history throught listening which will spark my curiosity even more. I want to be able to find more ways to connect myself and see the world differently through music.\n\nThe First Album\n\nToday is Day One and we're starting at the 50's . I am listening to album Let's Go Dancing To Rock And Roll by Hen Gates And His Gaters\n\nTitle Let's Go Dancing to Rock and Roll Artist Hen Gates And His Gaters\n\nSo far, i've enjoyed it. It like the genre so far. We're off to a great start.\n\nSome limitations\n\nNot everything will be on Apple Music as I found out with Let's Go Dancing to Rock and Roll. Youtube is my next solution. That involves me making a playlist since it hasn't been organized by someone else. I won't let this discourage me but it will be challenging at times.\n\nHow long will this take?\n\nI will share my progress in listening and what I have learned so far in future blog posts, at various cyles such as various intervals. Definetly will share at albums number 250, 500, 750 and of course at 1000. According to basic math, it will take me close to 2.75 years to complete this if I do one album a day. This could either go faster or slower depending the circumstances.\n\nBuild a microsite\n\nI will create a web app or a static page that I update daily or every few days on what I am listening to from the book. It will take suggestions using webmentions and other forms of contact.\n\nThe link will come soon in an upate post.\n\nRecomendations\n\nDo any of you have any recommendations for music to listen to? Send them my way, I'd love to see what you all recommend!", "label": "personal"}

What I mean by irritable weather was facing, \"four seasons in one week.\" You're probably thinking the following: \"How is this possible?\" It simply does! If you know, you know. Here are a few examples (No particular order)\n\nOne day it can be a nice spring day with all the flowers blooming being happy as can be. The following day you could wake up to find out that there is a blizzard in effect. A few days, it could be scorching hot and wondering how we got here? The last few days of the week, it could be a beautiful, soothing fall day and you forget about the weather tragedies of earlier of the week.\n\nAs chaotic as it sounds, I do miss it. I do miss sometimes not knowing if I will melt one day or be trapped in my home for many days at a time. My favorite is knowing if my home would fly away in a tornado. As silly and boring the topic of weather is, it is also a bonding activity with people who live in this region. It's almost a pastime knowing we could just die at any minute.\n\nIf I were to pick a favorite season, it would be winter. Are you in shock? Even I don't believe it. I do miss dressing up all nice for the winter. Who doesn't like wearing cute winter outfits. If were going to suffer in the cold we might as well look our best!\n\nI moved to California to live in a different place and subconsciously to escape the cold. In Northern California it is generally just hot here all the time. I do miss having season changes. Geography and location tends to influence the type of weather or climate one lives in.\n\nYou can take the person out of the midwest but you can't take the Midwestern out of the person.\n\nAlso posted on IndieNews", "label": "personal"}
{"title": "A Letter Regarding Budget Cuts at the University of Nebraska Kearney", "url": "https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/letter-to-unk", "content": "My Letter to UNK and NU System\n\nThis week I found out that the university \"needs\" to perform a $3 million budget cut at the University of Nebraska at Kearney (UNK). This is angering and saddening. This creates a huge hole on the UNK campus. I graduated from the university in 2019. I graduated with a B.A. in Modern Languages. This hurts to hear that many programs such as the French program are being cut. The Modern Language Department was my home during my time at the University. It pushed me out of my comfort zone that led me to even great worldview experiences such as study abroad. The French program in Modern Languages helped prepare me to become a teacher and helped to interact with people of all backgrounds and cultures.\n\nUNK needs to have a complete modern language department to prepare students in this globalized world. Learning a language isn't about learning simply a language. Languages expand a person's worldview. You learn culture, you learn experiences, you learn how different societies work. We can't have young people's viewpoints and perspectives stuck glued to the environment they are in. They need to branch out. Going to college is a place where people learn to build deeper connections with others. This includes people they interact with daily and people who are different from them culturally. The modern languages department is such a vital program.\n\nWhat hurts more is the attack on the arts and humanities. The arts and humanities are important for a well rounded education. We need students to explore subjects outside of their majors. I learned a lot from the humanities and the arts.\n\nI ask the University of Nebraska not to eliminate these programs. If the entire university system wants to retain more people in Nebraska, before entering, during college, and post college, we must allow these opportunities.\n\nUNK is the only proper public university in Nebraska that geographically serves so many students in the western half of the state. UNK offers so many programs closer to home that many in years past had to attend schools further away from home to enter the programs needed.\n\nI am proud to be a graduate of the University of Nebraska at Kearney. This saddens me to see UNK and the entire university system go through this dark time. Please reconsider all the damage that is to come. Every single higher position university administrator and faculty must fight for the interest of students - current and present.\n\nRepresentatives of the Nebraska University system need to find and pressure funding from the state. The state has done so much damage from cutting budgets year after year. We must fight those who are against public education and higher education who put us in a chokehold.\n\nWe are currently facing so many attacks on public education and higher education from various places.

{"title": "Round-Up of October 2023 IndieWeb Carnival", "url": "https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/indieweb-carnival-selfcare-round-up", "content": "October is a wrap! \ud83c\udf83 I hosted October's IndieWeb Carnival on self-care. Thank you to everyone who participated in this month's IndieWeb Carnival topic. I appreciate all the responses I recieved. I recieved so many perspectives on the topic. I chose this theme as this is something I am working on improving for myself.\n\nCarnival Stats Responses 10 Happiness \u221e\n\nResponses\n\nSara Jak\u0161a - Using 4 E of Cognition to Conceptualise Self-Care\n\nI really enjoyed the way way you structured your reponse using the 4 E of cognition: embodied, embedded, extended, and enactivistic. I really appreciate the approaches using your educational background to explain. It has really helped me see things in a different perspective. I agree that self-care is \"a process to adapt my life\". One must adapt. You're right, I can't ignore self-care because whether or not I felt I was ignoring it. I was doing it whether I admit it or not. I now see it as having a low battery. It had some juice. I realize now I was also scared of myself, nervous of outcomes, and more. I realized many things. I ignored my ehealth. I really enjoy how you ended the response, \"do the self-care for the reason of your better wellbeing.\" I am doing this for myself.Thank you for being so straight foward and not beating around the bush.\n\nGrigor Malo - Should we care about self-care?\n\nI really enjoyed \"[your] answer to the prompt\" and the approach. I would agree with you some self-care/help guides do take the wrong approach. It often seems like how to appear to be fine on the outside but not actually on the inside. It's been hard in the pastto find self-care/help material related to my cultural background or for individuals who live in a multiculural life. There is no one size fits all. Hyper-individualism or individualism has been a conflicting thing for me. Why do we need to isolate ourself when things can also be experienced with other people as well. I also agree that action at the end of the day starts with the individual. \"Caring about your self is a fundamentally selfish endeavour? Not really, or at least not if practiced properly.\" That is a beautifully written phrase. I share many of the same thoughts on wellness industry and the corporate wellness. You really put in the persepective how much we buy into capitalism to feel better about ourselves.\n\nFrank Meeuwsen - Global PSC Awareness Day and selfcare\n\nFirst, I like the multilingual approach created for this post. Thank you for sharing about Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis and your experience living with this disease. I really enjoy the approach you take. With self-care you learn to see things in a positive light. I agree with \"to rest more and consciously slow down.\" This has been something I've been learning as well. It became unhealth and bad for mental health. Strecthing yourself thin is not feasible anymore. I appreciate you aspect on learning to take control of a situation. \"I know I can affect it. I know now that I can change it.\" This resonates with me so much!\n\nJeremy Cherfasi - Self-care Success\n\nI really your approach of enjoying the little and big things in life. I can agree that traveling has always been a way of self-care. A way to disconnect physically from the place one is based out of to a different environment. Self-care to you seems that you truly enjoy life and you genuinely enjoy the things you do such as biking, baking, etc. You wrote having \"a sense of purpose and of mastery\" is something I resonate with. I'm still trying to find my sense of purpose. I'm learning not to stretch myself thin an focus on the things I love. I love who you wish the drivers to take care of themselves\n\nTracy Durnell - Extending my understanding of self-care\n\nRight off the bat, your approach on the \"bigger whole\" is a like a piece of the puzzle or a train network. If any of it is missing, it simply doesn't work well. Community is so important. Unforntunately we live in a very individualistic society and we need community more than ever. \"So much of self-care is treating the symptoms rather than the source, because the source is systemic.\" I didn't think about it this way. I recently started going to therapy and I thought the goal was to get to the get to the root of the problem while hitting the symptoms like a ping pong. Thank you for sharing the books you mentioned in your response. There are so many self-care books it's hard to find where to start. I'm trying to get to the right path. Oh man, this is hits hard: \"Showing up for our friends better, sometimes that means showing up for ourselves, and sometimes it\u2019s shared.\" This makes me reflect, when I wasn't for there for myself, I wasn't there for my community in this case, my friends. If I wasn't Self-care shows that you can care for yourself and for others. This has been a year of improvement but so much I still have to reach. Thank you for sharing this perspective on community and individuals. This opened my eyes in so many ways.\n\nAnthony Ciccarello - Creating space to feel my emotions\n\nI can relate so much with Anthony's response. Right away, the second sentence, \"My natural inclination is to bury my own emotions to protect my relationships\" is very similar to what I've felt over the years. All at my expense. Bottling it all up just wears a peson down. I've been very hesitant about sharing that I've been seeing a therapist and how I've started to open up a lot more to people on what's happening in life. I really appreciate your emphasis and approach on the word, space. A space can have so many purposes. I've been learning how to use spaces inside and outside as more than being inside and outside. The space one uses can truly affect the outcomes of self-care. Spaces to think, spaces, to move, spaces to unwind, and a space to grow demonstrate healthy, safe, self-reflection and so much more.\n\nJo - Things to do offline\n\nJo does a great job at \"kill[ing] two birds with one stone\" by addressing the self-care prompt and a post I wrote on books. The response is amazing. I really like perspective on reading books. I don't discourage reading not matter the format. We live in a world where we have so many different mediums of reading. Reading away from anything that has a microchip of any kind is for me a form of reset. Just like you mentioned, sometimes the only way to get access to specific content is via digital means. Reading physical really helps reground and reconnect with the digital world. Having solo time and hanging out with people is great but a balance is necessary. You defintely don't want to go to far on the solo end or not having solo time and spending too much time with others. It's a preference in many aspects. I enjoyed your self-care activity list! I get lost with looking at vinyls at the record shop.\n\nCJ - Self-Care and Routine\n\nCJ has some great points on find things at are less \"productive-feeling.\" For the longest time, doing things like watching Netflix or go to the movies, I felt that I was wasting time and I pushed these activities away. It's been hard just to disconnect from my obligations and I've come to the realizations that I need to sit my ass down and just relax. It's not necessary to be always engaged in things that are \"productive.\" It's productive to let your mind engage in other things!\n\nAlex Sirac - Improving our relationship to news\n\nAlex has a written a great post on self-care by focusing on news consumption. Right away you wrote, \"Not only do I spend too much time on the Internet \u2013 I spend way too much time consuming content and news.\" You took the words right out of my mouth. News isn't limited to listening to reading it online, or watching it on the television (or historically radio). Now the news in the 21st comes in so many different mediums such as podcasts. I've seen an increase of this negative news. It discourages me to use any form of social media, even decentralized social media. I want to ignore but it seems hard not to even if you don't click links. \"Curating a me-friendly news experience\" by \"find[ing] the things that bring you joy and give your brain a break from the hate.\" It's important to step away from even if it's for a little while. We can't let it consume us to the core. It will make use dark and bitter. I catch myself becoming angry. You make a great point on finding the right sources and filtering things out by using an RSS reader. Even I as an avid New York Times and leftist news person, have to turn off my computer and throw my phone across the room to reattach myself to the world around me. It's got to the point where I have to go into my terminal and turn off the Docker container and turn of my RSS reader. There has to be a better way for everything. Support local journalism because we need to know what's happening in our hometowns and the places we live. We need to now what's happening in our communities to make a difference and become aware what's around us.\n\nJames G - Self Care\n\nJames wrote beautiful response regarding self-care. It is complicated! This has been something I've had to learn the hardway, \"I know, deep down, that feeling is unsustainable: one can't be creative every day.\" We want to create more every damn day. It's not always feasible. I agree with the following, \"I don't need to create new things all the time.\" The way I see it, is work on the things you are working on and give it your full attention in a reasonable manner. It's great to find comfort in things we are familiar with. It allows us to be vulnerable.\n\nLate or Missing Reponses\n\nIf you still would like to write a response for October, I'd be happy to recieve more. If you sent me a response and I missed it, please email me directly at pablo@lifeofpablo.com. I'll update this post.\n\nNovember IndieWeb Carnival\n\nNow, I will pass torche to Alex Sirac. Alex is writing on community and belonging for the month of November. C'est parti !\n\nInterested in participating and/or hosting an IndieWeb Carnival, please click here!

{"title": "Train Rides & Trader Joe's", "url": "https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/train-rides-and-trader-joes", "content": "Train Rides & Trader Joe's\n\nA view of the train from the inside\n\nThis post was written in English (en_US).\n\nEver since I was a kid I was always facinated with public transporation. I remember watching television and videos on the internet of people getting on public transportation. I always wondered why it isn't common to have it everywhere. I've lived in various parts around the world where it is simply normal to have various methods of public transportation. Having lived in Mexico for short periods of times, I did ride buses to get to the city because it was the most economical way. One slight issue living in the United States, I didn't grow up in an area where public transportion was none existent. I grew up in Nebraska. You needed a car to get around. It was also weird to be walking around. I found that idea to be weird.\n\nThe world has been surpassing the United States for decades. It's getting more obvious every day.\n\nSince I moved the California, I've taken the Amtrak Train thirty-five (35) times since 2021. It's an easy trip to do between Sacramento and San Francisco or even to other cities in California.\n\nTimes I've Taken the Train Year Progress 2021 - 7 Times 2022 - 9 Times 2023 - 17 Times\n\nThe last time I did even remotely close to this was when I was living in France. I still have all the tickets to show.\n\nReasons I Take The Train:\n\nEnvironment - A lot more people can move around all at one time and it elimates so many cars off the roads. It helps reduce emissions.\n\nConvenience - There is enough trains throught out the day, that you can just book your ticket minutes before it heads out.\n\nAvoiding traffic - Driving isn't fun when you're surrounded by cars waiting for the line to move. It's nice not having to wait around in traffic when the train is simply going on its way on the the tracks.\n\nNot paying for parking - Parking in cities such as San Francisco is so expensive or you have to move your car for city services. It seems so much of a hastle to be worrying about your car in a place where you can walk.\n\nNot worrying about my car in a big city. - With so many car break-ins happening throughout cities in the United States, I can breath a sigh of relief knowing I don't have to worry about my car left alone or pondering if I did my best to get everything out of sight.\n\nI can get work done on the train. - I'm always working on my computer and I can get so much done weather it's for work or for personal endeavors.\n\nI also enjoy getting groceries at Trader Joe's before I get on the train especially if I'm going to get back to Sacramento late. It's nice to be able to get groceries for the week and take them with me on the train. It's a small little habit or tradition. I also save money by buying snacks ahead of time and not having to spend extra on snacks on the train.\n\nI hope my friend Sammy can come out to California for a fun train ride from Sacramento to San Francisco. I know he'd love it. Heck even one of these days, I'd love to catch the train that runs (Amtrak California Zephyr) through our hometowns in Nebraska and ride up to Sacramento. Hopefully soon!", "label": "personal"}

Merci Alex pour ta pr\u00e9sentation sur la sujet de communaut\u00e9.\n\nCommunity and belonging for me means, a place I feel that I belong and a place where I can be accepted for who I am. It's been hard to integrate into some communities. Often, being the only person color in a community has been difficult at times.We enter and leave communities as we older. Some communities change for the greater good and others change not for the greater good. I belong to different communities. My background and life experiences have influenced who I've become and the things I've been interested in. I've entered new ones while I've left others. Some communities I can come back and be able to jump right in right where I left off. There are communities where it was only during a certain period of my life and might be harder to be in now. There are communities where I've had to leave because it no longer followed who I was as a person or it wasn't good for me. Some became dangerous in their vission\n\nI'd like to talk about community and belonging in these three (3) situations or places.\n\nBeing a Multilingual\n\nBeing a Student in France\n\nIndieWeb\n\nI'd like to write about these topics in this carnival but I'd like to take make a dedicated post with a slightly different approach.\n\nBeing Mexican and American\n\nGrowing up in Nebraska\n\nBeing Multilingual\n\nHere in the United States, it's not common for people to speak another language. Which is a shame. Growing up in a small town in Nebraska, it often seemed that it was few of us who would consistently speak another language. Even at a young age, I felt we had a small unintentional community. I was very fortunate to grow up bilingual - Spanish & English (in this order). Then I learned French in my teens.\n\nBeing a multilingual here in the United States has allowed me to be join new communities. With the amount of people who don't speak at least a second language on a constant basis, it almost feels exclusive to be multilingual. It allows me to have deeper connections with others. It allows me to belong in various communities. When I was living in Omaha, One example is attending French speaking events at Alliance Fran\u00e7aise and on Meet-Up. It was so amazing that I could find so many individuals who I can speak French with and share many of the world views. It was nice to meet so many francophiles and francophones who enjoyed sharing culture, language, cuisine, wine and so much more. I would become great friends with these individuals. Now that I live far away, I know if I were to visit or move back, I could rejoin this community. Going back to a place where I'm a visitor and one I am familiar with, I know I can find a place of belonging again.\n\nGrowing up in a place that lacked lingual diversity, or to simply put it - growing up in a very vanilla place, it also seemed that there was a community that didn't seem to like people speaking different languages. It seemed to alienate them. There seemed to be pressure to join the community where one needed to behave and present themselves with the majority. I know people who had my cultural background give into that community and not speak their language spoken at home. Parents gave in the idea that there kids will be more valuable in society if they don't speak another language. I felt supported and limited by these co-existing communities. I'd be lying if at one point I didn't fall in this negative community. I felt at times I needed this negative community to to belong. Learning to belong to something that conflict with my values felt like being pulled in both directions.\n\nBeing a Student in France\n\nI have very fond memories of being an exchange student in France. I studied at the Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg at the age 22. Being a student in France was different compared the attending university in the United States. Being in University you build Not only was I apart of the exchange student community but I was also a student trying to improve my French abilities. I was the only student from the university back home who attended a program in France. I isolated myself the Americans. In a way I left the \"American\" community for many months. I saw this as a blessing to form new habits and quickly find a new community or communities. We were here to learn the French language. We all were from various parts of the world. I was hanging out with all the people and students from France, the rest of the European Union, South America, and basically anyone from around the world. Just not the Americans\n\nWe were homesick. We bonded with food. We made meals from our respective cultures. We would learn about their upbringing and how they got to France. We all bonded together because many of us had experiences with immigrant culture. Many of these students were also immigrants to France or have been in the European Union already. They were trying establish themselves and incorporate themselves in the society. Seeing them everyday reminded me of my parents telling me stories of them trying to make their way in the United States. I understand being in a new place and trying to find a sense of belonging can be daunting.\n\nYes, I could do many of these things back at my home university. There was such a deeper connection with these international students. We were living and studying in a place where being a student meant so much more. I felt I could have genuine conversations with people. I really felt like I belonged here and understand what it's like to be student outside the United States. Student community here is nothing like in the United States.\n\nIndieWeb\n\nOh the IndieWeb! I joined back in March 2023. I heard of the IndieWeb throughout the years but didn't think much of it. I'm happy that I got the interest and courage to join. This is a community that I am truly happy to have found. It has become a community I truly feel that I am apart of. The best part of it is getting to meet so many great people and interacting with them on a weekly basis. People are so willing to help each other out. I've had people reach out if there is something wrong with my website or microformats are not placed correctly. It's been pretty rad attending Homebrew Website Club. Every single one of them has been pretty amazing. I really enjoy the encouragement of taking initiative to as planning events, starting writing carnivals, etc. It's a pretty open group.\n\nThe IndieWeb has helped me grow as an individual. It has also rekindled the fire in things I didn't think I would find interest again. One example of that is blogging. It This community has helped me find a new place of belonging.\n\nI will admit since I'm still relatively new to the community, I'm still a little shy and still learning the ropes. I know that this is part of the journey.\n\nConclusion\n\nI'm happy with all these experiences.", "label": "personal"}

I'm that person who doesn't use Spotify. I left Spotify a while ago. I instead use Apple Music does something similar to Spotify Wrapped. I honestly didn't know that Apple Music had a feature to share. Now it's time for the results my Apple Music Replay'23 (the Apple equivalent to Spotify Wrappted) to shine. It was interesting because I had to launch my browser to get the Replay'23 instead of it being in app. It was easy to share on social media as images. My listens ranged from mid/late 2000s to more recent. I really liked listening to The Submarines. I'm a sucker for the song Brightest Hour.\n\nThis coming I would like to discover smaller indie bands and attend more concerts to get out of my cycle of repeating and getting too comfortable with the things I listen often.\n\nI really like Jo's Post on what she listened to on Spotify. I love what you listened to this year and how you organized your post!\n\nI read Henrique's Post on what he listened to on Spotify. He made me remember that I need to give my vinyls a little more love (or a spin) and decrease my listening minutes on my phone.\n\nI know I have an interesting taste in Music but I like listening to alternative.\n\nWell here you go!

He also asks his readers to answer the question\n\nWhere do you call home? And why? I\u2019ve been struggling with the concept of home for the past several years.\n\nOn the surface, this seems like a very simple question to answer but the answer can be be complex. For me, I take the complex route. I too have been struggling with this question. Home is where major moments have occured in my life.\n\nI grew up in Nebraska which was home for 25+ years. I say this is one place I call home is due to the fact this is where I grew up. It's where I learned the norms of the Midwest and how it influenced my persona. Nebraska is home because this is where many of my friends I made in university still reside. I have many deep connections with others. I somehow always end up here such as the holidays and other important events. It's a very special place to me but it is not the place I cull my current home.\n\nMexico is also my home for the fact I've lived there on an off though out the years. I learned what is was like to be around non-Americans. Living in Mexico, I got meet so many family members. I learned more of the traditions of my people and how live in a community. I learned that this was a place of rich culture and rich gastronomy. I learned to not take things for granted. It's a place I call home because it allows me to be different person compared to my American self. For the record, I don't go to resorts, I stay in rural Mexico. This is a home I return to often. This home is important to my identity.\n\nThe home I consider currently now is in California. This is the first place I moved away to where I didn't go back to my parents' home after an extended leave such as a trip or going to university. I work here now and I have built out new relationships. I'm still pretty new here. Living in California has allowed me to be more of myself and allow me to express myself. This is home because I get to work on myself as well. When people ask me where am I based out of or where is my home is, I always say California.\n\nI also ask the same question, \"Where do you call home? And why?\"", "label": "personal"}

I'm excited to see my friends and most importantly, my family.\n\nMy hometown is quiet. There's enough to do. There are stores, parks, movie theaters. Just enough. There are subtle things I do miss about my hometown. It's the place that saw me grow up. A place where I am familiar with.\n\nSomething happens as I enter my childhood home. I spent most of my childhood in this house. When I step into the home, so many many memories flood my mind. It's like I unzipped a .zip file and the entire folder just spills. Every step I take and every time I turn my head, flashbacks come to me as well.\n\nThere are so many moments that make me feel happy. I remember it was here I got my first computer. It's where I learned to ride a bike. I remember helping my mom study for the U.S Citizenship Test everyday afterschool. I remember numerous times packing and unpacking for/from Mexico. I remember the moment I learned I was accepted into university.\n\nMy bedroom was a place of safety. A place where I could be myself. The place where I learned. I took apart my first computer. A place I recorded my first audio note. A place to allow my emotions to run free.\n\nWe didn't live in the best house but it was our house. We had a roof over our heads.\n\nI reflect back on all this and it brings a smile of joy. So much has happened. So many things happening in the background I didn't know were happening.\n\nI'm here now rearranging my room. I feel happy that I can still make it my own and still have a place of safety.", "label": "personal"}
{"title": "The Friend I Made on the Bus", "url": "https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/friend-on-bus", "content": "I was browsing the web and I happened to stumble upon this Instagram post. It was a screenshot of a tweet OP posted about two girls on a cruise who became best friends for the day. One of the girls was looking for her best friend that day.\n\nHere is what the post said, if you don't want to open an Instagram link. The post also has the picture of two girls on the cruise sitting next to each other.\n\nin Hawaii in 2006. We were basically best friends for that night so I need y'all to help me find my bestfriend because I miss her and I need to see how she's doing now. Please retweet this so we can be reunited.\n\nThis helped me unlock a memory of an experience I had as a young kid. I remember my family and I took the Greyhound bus back from Mexico all the way to Nebraska. This was in the early 2000s. Let me tell you. When you're six or seven on a bus from Southern Mexico to Nebraska, you feel like dying, died, and forgot you died on a 48+ hour (or however long) ride. Maybe I'm being dramatic. It wasn't a pleasant ride, at least most of it.\n\nI remember when the bus made a stop somewhere in Texas possibly in Austin or Dallas. I remember I was already having a bad time since I've been on a bus for an extended amount of time. Then some kid around my age got on the bus with his family. I gave him the nod to acknowledge him. He happened to sit near us. An hour or so had passed and I was curious and was desperate to talk to someone who wasn't in my family. So I said hello to the kid. I don't regret doing so.\n\nWhen I said hello, right off the bat we hit it off. We were talking about a bunch of nerd stuff that kids our age were interested in.. I remember bringing up our computers and we lost our minds. I was telling him about the iMac G3s I would use at school or how my friend built a small website on his computer. He would tell me about things he'd create on Kid Pix. We also talked about our favorite TV shows, our hobbies, and upbringings. We shared stories. This kid was super cool! I hope he thought I was cool too. We had a grand old time.\n\nAt some point, he and his family had to get off to their transfer point or it was their final destination. We said our goodbyes. Then I waved at him, he waved back when he was on the ground. It was a very warm and sad moment to say goodbye to my best friend of that day.\n\nI unfortunately don't remember his name and I doubt he remembers mine. At that time, it wasn't common for young kids to have a cell phone. We didn't exchange numbers or email. I think about this often. I wish I could find out where he is and if he is doing well. Who knows what paths we've taken? Have we crossed paths and not known it? I hope we get to meet someday and this post comes across him and we could reconnect.\n\nIf you're out there man, say hello!\n\nDo you have a story similar to this? I'd love to hear from you.", "label": "personal"}

When the holidays approach, I get excited to see snow on the ground. There are so many celebrations and traditions that exist. For myself, I celebrate Mexican traditions and American celebrations. I live between the two cultures and grew up in the United States and have lived in Mexico. At my parents home, we celebrate as if we were in Mexico.\n\nEvery year is different. Sometimes I'm in Oaxaca during the month of December and sometimes I'm in the United States. We celebrate Mexican traditions there but more precisely, the Oaxacan traditions. I like to go see the dances and the parades. May I say it's heavenly go to the food markets and try all the delicious meals.\n\nMexican Traditions:\n\nMy family really likes cooking at home. We make many traditional dishes. We make tamales of various flavors, Mexican punch, mole, cakes, shrimp cocktails, and so much more. There's no limit. In this month, we don't normally eat out. Homemade food tastes so much better!\n\nIn the evenings, we relax and watch some holiday movies. We like to watch movies in Spanish, especially any of the classics. Every year we see Home Alone in Spanish because it's very funny. It hits differently in Spanish. Just being together is important. We can laugh as a family.\n\nWe do decorate our Christmas tree. We open the presents on the night of December 24. It's a traditon. It's always been like that.\n\nUnited States Traditions:\n\nI always make sure to meet up with my friends when I return to Nebraska. Now that we don't live near each other anymore, it's very important to be together when we are back in our hometowns. We check in with each other and see how our year went and what our goals are for the upcoming year. We build ginger houses and we have a party. What could go wrong? Depending on how the weather is, we're riding our longboards or we're going to skate park.\n\nIm always excited for a night of programming fun. We just see where the night will take us. We make it our goal to stay up until dawn. It's a very nice thing to schedule something together. I think we're going to make a video game this year. Let's see what happens...\n\nThis is my response to IndieWeb Carnival December 2023 \u2014 Holiday and December traditions Thank you for hosting Jo!

{"title": "Using JSON on My Site", "url": "https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/using-json-on-my-site", "content": "Using JSON on My Site\n\nThis post was written in English (en_US).\n\nThis past week, I've been learning to use JSON on my website. As I am learning to implement a Micropub Server on my site, I feel that I should learn how JSON works. In a way JSON has been used on my site before by using microformats in the rendered HTML code and being read by other sites and services. I've been wanting to explore ways to update content on my site in a more effective manner instead of having to manually update html code for each entry of a list. An example of this would be a list of movies I watched. This is still a a learning process. I have so much to learn. I want to expand Datenstrom Yellow, the flat-file c I am using, to still be simple but be powerful at the same time.\n\nAn issue I have to work out for longevity and simplicity is by creating an extension for the different lists. Right now I have to create a layout for a particular list such as movies , create a new markdown page in my content folder, and finally set the desired layout (template). An example of this would be Layout: movies . This isn't ideal when I write a blog post. If I changed the layout of a blog post, it wouldn't be recognized as a blog post in the main blog feed. That's where an extension would come in place and place it in the markdown file of the blog post or any other page I'd like to create on my website. This wouldn't require to change the layout. In the markdown file, I could simply place, [list 1] or even simply, [movies] to show the list. Coming Soon!\n\nExample Code:\n\nHere's the layout for movies.html . I use PHP to create the reoccuring HTML elements automatically when I modify the movie JSON file. It will update the list accordingly.\n\n$this ->yellow->layout( \"header\" ) < div class = \"content\" > < div class = \"main h-entry\" role = \"main\" > < h1 > echo $this ->yellow->page->getHtml( \"titleContent\" ) </ h1 > < div class = \"entry-content e-content\" > echo $this ->yellow->page->getContentHtml() </ div > < div class = \"mw6 center\" > $catalog_json = file_get_contents( 'media/downloads/movies.json' ); $decoded_json = json_decode($catalog_json, true ); $items = $decoded_json[ 'movies' ]; foreach ($items as $item) { $id = $item[ 'id' ]; $name = $item[ 'title' ]; $cover = $item[ 'cover' ]; $info_url = $item[ 'info_url' ]; echo '<article class=\"h-item\">' ; echo '<a class=\"link dt w-100 bb b--black-10 pb2 mt2 dim blue u-url\" href=\"' .$info_url. '\">' ; echo '<div class=\"dtc w4\">' ; echo '<img src=\" ' .$cover. '\" class=\"db w-100 u-photo\" alt=\"movie poster of ' .$name. '\"/>' ; echo '</div>' ; echo '<div class=\"dtc v-top pl2\">' ; echo '<h1 class=\"f6 f5-ns fw6 lh-title black mv0 p-name\">' .$name. '</h1>' ; echo '<dl class=\"mt2 f6\">' ; echo '<dt class=\"clip\">ID</dt>' ; echo '<dd class=\"ml0\">ID: ' .$id. '</dd>' ; echo '</dl>' ; echo '</div>' ; echo '</a>' ; echo '</article>' ; } </ div > < div class = \"permalink\" > Permalink: < a class = \"u-url\" href = \"https://lifeofpablo.com<?php echo $this->yellow->page->getLocation($absoluteLocation = false) ?>\" > https://lifeofpablo.com echo $this ->yellow->page->getLocation($absoluteLocation = false ) </ a > </ div > </ div > </ div > $this ->yellow->layout( \"footer\" )\n\nJSON\n\nThis is the example movie JSON (movies.json) code for the movies I watched in 2023.

I started to consume matcha two years ago. Ever since, I've been hooked on it. I love getting matcha from different places from coffee shops or restaurants because when mixed in for a drink, each place makes it different. Most of the time, I consume matcha as a tea or as a latte. There is something so special about getting in a different city. When I was visiting New York City, I lived on matcha lattes and matcha teas to keep me going on the miles and miles of walking that I'm not used to doing. Being a city like New York, it is exhausting mentally and physically due to the stimuli and increased physical activity from the sedentary lifestyle.\n\nMatcha has caffeine in it but it doesn't affect me the same as coffee. Coffee and espresso keeps me jittery and has be bouncing off the walls. Not a good feeling overall. I'm not opposed to having coffee or espresso but not my preferred choice. Matcha doesn't keep me up at night. I don't see it as coffee but an item that has caffeine.\n\nWhen I went back to Nebraska, I was happy that some of the non-Starbucks coffee shops had matcha. I guess matcha is more common than ever.\n\nAm I crazy about matcha? Probably? Who am I kidding?! YES! I don't drink it often but when I do, I'm as happy as can be (at the moment.) It's the little things in life. I probably should make my own at home because it adds up going out to get it. That's a decision for another day.\n\nJust realized this could be a love letter to matcha.

The certificate had five courses ranging from basic networking to IT Security. I would say this was a well rounded course. It really put in perspective various aspects of an IT Support Professional. It was also a wake-up call! I have so much to learn still!!!\n\nBeing in this role, you could be a generalist or a specialist. This depends on the role one gets. In my role and working with a small team of IT professionals, I find myself being a generalist but also specialized in specific things.\n\nI find it important is to keep learning in my career. I plan on taking more courses to get more certificates to gain more skills. I started a Google Cyber Security Course and a mathematics course. I'm going to try to balance three to five courses. I want to get in the routine of going back to school. I find this funny because I work at a school. By having this routine, I would like to start my Master's program this year.\n\nI'm really excited for what's to come this year!

I noticed prices over the last year have been going up everywhere and Trader Joe's is no exception. I've been working on only buying the things I only need or things to supplement the items I have at home. For example, I bought spinach dip to help me finish the chips I have at home and I bought baby carrots (Cut & Peeled Carrots) to help finish the spinach dip. Inflation is coming on all of us hard. I almost gasped out loud in the store when I saw the price of a litter bottle of the Extra Virgin Olive Oil. I remember it being $8.99 now it's $10.99. It's just the little things that add up. I have to be extra mindful of the inventory of my kitchen and buy only the things I need and think of items that be versatile in use.\n\nOne of my goals this year is to simply not be as wasteful.

In the past I would blog sporadically. I've always loved blogging as it allows me to express myself and allow my thoughts to flow (when they feel like it). It's allowed me to become more expressive and to reconnect with myself. I would say I feel more satisfied in becoming more expressive and to reconnect myself. It's a piece of a puzzle.\n\nDeciding What to Share\n\nYou know how there are things about yourself for the longest time, you didn't know whether or not to share publicly? There are things I'm not willing to share. At some point you are ready to share certain things. Then, you come to the realization of \"How am I going to put this in words?\" That's the part that's tricky. That's me at this very moment in time. I'm ready to share. I'll do my best.\n\nThe Journey\n\nPart of this journey has been working on myself and learning to accept who I am as a person. For the longest time I wasn't living my true self. I lived in two worlds, the American lifestyle outside of home and the Latino culture at home. I felt like two walls parallel to each other trying to keep me aligned. I never felt enough for the Americans and never felt enough for the Mexicans. Me being the only boy in my immediate family, I had to set an example, I had to think about carrying the family last name, and etc. As an American who is Mexican, I always felt like I was more scrutinized under a microscope than my non-latino counterparts. I had to find ways to circumvent this to allow myself to slightly express myself even in the slightest. I worried so much people would think of me and I felt judged. I let that dictate so much of my life. I was so sad and miserable and asked myself, \"How much more of this can I take?\" All this put me in a negative headspace that hurt me and directly or indirectly hurt others I loved. I still cry thinking about this. I'm still learning how to undo this damage I've caused. It will take time but will it ever go away completely? I'm not sure. Going to therapy has aided in defragmenting so many pieces of my life. And made me realize that, I have to start living my own life and care for my own happiness. Healing has to be a priority.\n\nLurking\n\nIf you've been wondering this whole time what this post is about, yes, this is my coming out post. I've been for years waiting to share this moment in some format. I've thought about sharing on Instagram or Facebook but I decided against this. I'd rather do it on my personal website and any of the decentralized platforms I use. I've watched so many coming out videos, and social media posts of people I know or strangers on the internet. That has been inspiring. I've been lurking the idea of this for so long. I finally brought myself to do this. Once I publish this, there is no going back. Once something is on the internet, it's there forever. I would be lying if I said I wasn't nervous or having second thoughts. I also think about how we live in a time where LGBT rights are under attack. I simply have to do this for myself and face the outcome of this. Positive or negative. So here it is...\n\nMy Sexuality\n\n\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 I'm sharing that I'm a bisexual person. \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\n\nBisexuality is variously defined as romantic or sexual attraction to both males and females, to more than one gender, or attraction to both people of the same gender and different genders.\n\nI am attracted to both men and women. It's a spectrum and there is no 50%-50% split. I feel at this time more attractive to people who identify as male than I am to someone who identifies as female. That varies by day as well. Some of my greatest loves have been women. I'm also open to the attraction towards more gender identities.\n\nHow Long ?\n\nI knew since I was five or six that I felt different about myself. Then the questions of, \"when are you having a girlfriend?\" or \"I bet you have insert number here of girls chasing you!?\" I did want that to happen at many points. Also, I had big crushes on other dudes.\n\nWho have you told?\n\nI've told friends and family who I am as an individual. Every single one of them I've told, each interaction with them was different. Some interactions were very heavy with emotion, some were very easy, and some I felt I was going to die inside because I was afraid of the reaction. Some took time to come around. Everything came alright in the end. I've felt supported. Even if the interaction didn't go as well, I felt the anxiety leave my body and be at a new level of peace with myself. I still tear up thinking about how strong and vulnerable I was in every single interaction. I'm very lucky to have friends and family who are supported. Some mentioned, \"We knew, Pablo. We were waiting for you to share.\" *Queue laughing after ugly crying *. Every moment was beautiful. My relationships have become stronger. I no longer have to hide, in plain sight to my loved ones. They no longer have to see me suffer inside. My family bond has also become stronger. I don't have to hide by putting a wall around me. I can actually be open with them and tell them what I'm feeling.\n\nWhat's to come?\n\nWell, I've been going on dates and meeting lots of people in the community. I have a supported community living in California that makes it a bit easier. I have so much more to learn about myself and make my way. I want to explore my sexuality more and take it to the next level. I don't see my sexuality to be the forefront of my persona. It's a piece of the puzzle that helps form me to be simply, me! I've added this piece to the puzzle. There are other pieces that I have to find their place.\n\nI'm happier with myself now. I can smile an actual smile now. My face isn't hiding behind a mask. I'm starting to live my more authentic self. I'm still going to be me at the end of the day. My sexuality is only one piece of the puzzle of who I am as a person.", "label": "personal"}

I voted in the California Primary for the first time since moving here. I guess I do officially live here. I love how easy it is to vote in person here in Sacramento. The original plan was to submit my mail-in-ballot but I accidentally got my primary ballot soaked when I was carrying my water bottle. Of course, I forgot to request a new one and days went on without thinking about it. Then it dawned on me that today was voting day. I had in my navigation to a specific voting location and on the way there, I saw another polling location. I canceled the navigation and pulled into the polling places I had just driven by. I was so excited because, why go out of my way when I can do it right then and there!\n\nChecking in was easy. I gave my basic information for them to print off the ballot. There was an option to do it electronically but I chose paper instead. I was briefed on where the ballot drop-box was located to place the ballot after I have completed filling it out. My ballot was placed in a secrecy vanilla folder to provide discretion in carrying it between the voting official station and the voting cubicle. After receiving the ballot, I went to a voting station cubicle and filled in my ballot. I voted for those I felt would do good in their current or future positions. I had done some research on the candidates. If you don't, you really should see what each candidate stands for and look at the finer details. Then, once I was satisfied with myself filling in all the ovals, I placed the ballot in the secrecy vanilla folder to prepare to turn it in. I walked across the room to place the ballot in the ballot drop-box.\n\nFinally, I got a sticker to show off that I voted. This time I chose a sticker that says, \"Yo Vot\u00e9\" which is Spanish for, \"I Voted\".\n\nIt was that easy! It seemed very seamless. This really motivates me to pay attention in local elections that help shape the future of the city I am living in. Voting is important and a fundamental right which I am happy to exercise. I'm happy I participated in doing my civic duty to vote. We all have a voice. We are the voice for those who can't.", "label": "personal"}

It's taught me things, I wouldn't learn staying in one place. Learning about yourself is key for growth. Often, while learning we also learn from people. These people you learn from are strangers. I remember hanging out with strangers in Rome for an entire day. I've roamed around the city of Seoul, Korea with people I met on the bus. You get the idea. Meeting strangers is fun.\n\nI've learned so much from the people I've interacted on my travels. They've shown me their perspective on various topics and provided some life advice as well. All of these people have been strangers. I made a connection with them even if was sitting with them, eating lunch or spending the day with them.

I want to also have degrees beyond a bachelor's degree. My goal in the near but possibly distance future is to get a doctorate degree. Even with a master's degree, it's been a dream to teach a course or two at the university level.

Woo hoo! I've lived on this earth for 29 years. Time flies and I honestly didn't think I would have made it this far but here I am! That being said, I have officially entered my last year of my 20s. It\u2019s a tad bitter sweet. but the positive overtakes the negative by a long shot. I reflect the growth I\u2019ve had when I entered my 20s.\n\n28 was a fun year of adventures and of learning. It was very fulfilling. I'm smiling as I think of the things I did this year. I would say 28 was a level up in all aspects. I felt more accomplished and I had an increased sense of self-direction.\n\nTraveled with friends\n\nTook myself on Artist Dates\n\nHelped develop a game with Friends\n\nGetting Google Certified in a few areas\n\nVoted in my first California Primary\n\nSang in a few choir concerts\n\n29 will be a great transition year into the next decade of my life. I\u2019m still discovering who I am as an individual. I now know more about myself than ever. I feel a bit wiser. This has been a year of a lot of reflection.\n\nThere is so much to learn about this world and where I stand in it. I continue to learn from people around me and the things unknown to me. What does it mean to be a Mexican-American at 29 years of age?\n\nA lot will happen this year. Many events this year will have an effect on me directly and indirectly. I am excited and terrified for what's to come. I will keep my head up and fight for the greater good. I've learned not to be anxious of things I can't control yet because they haven't happened yet. Being more in the present is key to the well being of myself.\n\nI've made many mistakes in years past. that I don't want to replicate. There are things I am not proud of but I've come to terms of not living in the past. I don't allow myself to beat myself up as hard as I used to. There's no need spend energy on things that don't matter anymore.\n\nJust learning to love myself this past year and I am continuing to work on myself. I'm in a better place now than when I had just turned 28. My mental health, my physical health, and emotional wellness are more in tune. Now that I've set the path, it's only up for these. I'm more balanced now.\n\nOn a positive note, I'm really excited to start school again. I really value learning and I have a desire to have a master's degree. Later this summer I'm also getting a promotion at work.\n\nSome items I wish to accomplish (no particular order) at 29\n\nLearn Chinese\n\nI WILL join cross fit or attend exercise classes.\n\nI would like to learn to dance.\n\nGet the startup I'm working on off the ground.\n\nWork on personal and work projects that have been on the back burner. I hope to reach these goals.\n\nJoin a LGBT sports league.\n\nGet my financials in order. I should set up a will.\n\nGo on a solo adventure far away from home.\n\nGo on more hikes!\n\nLooking Forward\n\nThere are so many positive things happening in my life. It's only up from here!

What better way than to expose yourself to other individual's tastes in music? I would hang out with Abraham and Luke. I'd say, they influenced who I am as a person and the direction of my musical tastes.\n\nAbraham grew up in Colombia and moved out to my hometown in Nebraska. Luke grew up in Hawaii and had moved to Nebraska a year before. Both Luke and Abraham played the guitar.

My friends at the time still took me in and accepted me into the group. It was super duper to watch live shows in my friend's basement. They used to play covers of Subline, Linkin Park, and Bullet for My Valentine.\n\nAt that time frame, I was very interested in photography and videography. I always carried my Sony Cyber-Shot with me because you never know when you would need to get that cool shot. You're probably thinking, \"That's some lame point in shoot!\" When your parents buy you a camera, you have to work with what you got! A camera is a camera!\n\nQuestion time!\n\nCan you guess which role did I play in my friend group? If you guessed the camera guy, you win a cookie! Do you like internet cookies?

It was a pretty cool experience getting blasted with hardcore metal while figuring out the best way of recording! I learned important fundamentals of video recording. I focused on stabilizing the camera, considering lighting, and audio clipping (which I had no control over). Not only was I enjoying myself but also I learned a lot.\n\nOne of my favorite memories when we weren't in Luke's basement was walking to get pizza. Living in a small town, things are relatively within walking distance.\n\nAs time went on friends came and went. We all went our different paths even though we lived in the same hometown for years.

I don't mind it for many reasons. Especially after the pandemic, the methods I use to interact with people have drastically changed.\n\nAttending online meetings is fun for me especially if I enjoy attending meetings on topics I enjoy! Attending anything IndieWeb-related via Homebrew Website Club. Topics discussed are the IndieWeb technologies, technical solutions, receiving advice on building something, and more. Of course, the meetings are not always technical. One of my favorite things we do in Homebrew Website Club is showing off the changes we've done on our personal websites! I love it when someone shares that new feature on their site or that blog post that someone finally finished! It makes me happy that people are proud of their work!\n\nWe also share those articles we like or share that cool website with that cool font or the picture someone took today. The meetings are for everyone to share a topic that is interesting to them. The conversation possibilities are endless. I've received great advice from fellow IndieWeb members on how to do XYZ. I also love picking the brains of others on XYZ especially when it comes to my personal website. I am very grateful for this. Some days I don't participate as often but I'm always attentive to what I can learn from others.\n\nI always look forward to events beyond Homebrew Website Club meetings! These are something to look forward to! These events usually have a specific goal or topic in mind. For example, I love attending writing meet-ups for dedicated writing time. It helps provide a dedicated time to write a blog post that's been marinating in my drafts for a while. Maybe you get the inspiration to write something completely new. I also enjoy the Build a Website in an Hour event to create a new page on your personal website or launch a completely new website. The event ideas are infinite! It'd be nice to see more variations on events. My goal is to host an event soon! Stay tuned!\n\nEveryone and anyone is welcome to attend these online events. You don't need to be part of the IndieWeb. If you're curious about joining one of the events, just come hang out with us! You don't have to have a personal website or be tech-savy. We'd be happy to answer your questions! Attending these meetings is a great way to connect with people located on the other side of the world.

I don't mind it for many reasons. Especially after the pandemic, the methods I use to interact with people have drastically changed.\n\nAttending online meetings is fun for me especially if I enjoy attending meetings on topics I enjoy! Attending anything IndieWeb-related via Homebrew Website Club. Topics discussed are the IndieWeb technologies, technical solutions, receiving advice on building something, and more. Of course, the meetings are not always technical. One of my favorite things we do in Homebrew Website Club is showing off the changes we've done on our personal websites! I love it when someone shares that new feature on their site or that blog post that someone finally finished! It makes me happy that people are proud of their work!\n\nWe also share those articles we like or share that cool website with that cool font or the picture someone took today. The meetings are for everyone to share a topic that is interesting to them. The conversation possibilities are endless. I've received great advice from fellow IndieWeb members on how to do XYZ. I also love picking the brains of others on XYZ especially when it comes to my personal website. I am very grateful for this. Some days I don't participate as often but I'm always attentive to what I can learn from others.\n\nI always look forward to events beyond Homebrew Website Club meetings! These are something to look forward to! These events usually have a specific goal or topic in mind. For example, I love attending writing meet-ups for dedicated writing time. It helps provide a dedicated time to write a blog post that's been marinating in my drafts for a while. Maybe you get the inspiration to write something completely new. I also enjoy the Build a Website in an Hour event to create a new page on your personal website or launch a completely new website. The event ideas are infinite! It'd be nice to see more variations on events. My goal is to host an event soon! Stay tuned!\n\nEveryone and anyone is welcome to attend these online events. You don't need to be part of the IndieWeb. If you're curious about joining one of the events, just come hang out with us! You don't have to have a personal website or be tech-savy. We'd be happy to answer your questions! Attending these meetings is a great way to connect with people located on the other side of the world. Maybe you'll meet someone who lives in the same city as you?\n\nThis blog post has been posted on IndieNews", "label": "personal"}

This is especially true when I return to Nebraska. When I land, I'll go with the person who picked me up at the diner after midnight. Going to the diner is a fun adventure when it's snowing, raining, sunny, hot, chilly, or raining cats and dogs!\n\nDiners are also places to meet people who have only met through a virtual medium such as video calls and online groups. Rarely do you meet people in real life (IRL) you get to converse weekly online.\n\nA few weeks ago in July, I met with James G. We both actively participate in the IndieWeb. (You should check it out!) James is a coffee lover and also enjoys writing. He was telling me about a coffee mojito.\n\nJames mentioned a while ago that he was visiting San Francisco for work during Homebrew Website Club. I was very excited to get a coffee and walk around the city. San Francisco is one of my favorite cities\n\nYou're wondering, \"So you two are getting coffee and talking? What 'bout the diner?\" Originally, getting coffee and chatting was the original plan. Then, I remembered that James loves diners and this got my brain juices flowing! WE SHOULD GO TO THE DINER! This is not a drill! I love a good side trip to spice up the adventure. Food and coffee unite people.\n\nI love food and getting caffeinated\n\nDiners are lovely! James loves diners. I've never heard of someone loving diners as much as he does! It makes me very happy!\n\nWe decided to eat at a fine establishment called the Pinecrest Diner. This place is an institution in San Francisco! Imagine a traditional diner restaurant with yummy breakfast food but in SF! The food is so heavenly people wait in line. This place truly hits the spot. They make the food in front of you due to the openness of the space.\n\nWhile eating, we caught up and we discussed various topics of interest. We discussed our visions for our respective personal websites, our current projects, Mozilla, and things to do in San Francisco such as checking out Noisebridge. I also recommended The Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment in Oakland. I enjoyed the discussions and ideas bounced off each other.\n\nThank you James for hanging out! I had a blast!\n\nI hope to see James when I'm on his side of the water. Should I see you at IndieWebCamp San Francisco?", "label": "personal"}

I\u2019ve been starting to get things organized but it almost seems there is no end. I enjoy taking breaks and leaving the apartment. Going on walks around the neighborhood is fun but I always go on an adventure. I\u2019m getting my steps on and I have fun! I also get a snack or coffee while on an adventure. The sidewalk and my legs are possibly the limit.\n\nEventually, I found myself near Powell Station to take a break. As I was leaning against a wall, I asked myself, \u201cWhat should I do to feel that I live here?\u201d and \u201cWhat is cheap but fulfilling?\u201d\n\nHmm\u2026.\n\nQueue the Jeopardy think music.\n\nYour browser does not support the audio element.\n\nIt came to me! I yelled out loud \u201cI know! I\u2019ll get a library card today!\u201d Mind you, I\u2019m at a busy location in the city. I think I started a bit of people waiting for the street car. There could be worse things to be yelling for in a city. Wouldn\u2019t you get excited if you wanted to get a library card? Going to the library is exciting! I\u2019m excited to go visit one of the oldest public institutions offered to the public! If I know anything about libraries in big cities, their main branch must be beautiful. Onward to the San Francisco Public Library!\n\nMan! When I walked into the SF Library, it was pretty cool! It\u2019s pretty modern! There is lots of elbow room to roam around!\n\nAs I\u2019m walking towards the library, I fill out the online application to start the process and get the confirmation number that I was provided.\n\nThen when I got to the desk, I was asked for this confirmation number, identification, and some proof of where I lived such as a utility bill or lease agreement. The process was super easy. The people working at the library were very friendly.\n\nHere is the library card design that I chose. It was either between the SF Giants or the drawing a second grader. Obviously, I went with the drawing because I don\u2019t care about baseball. The drawing is pretty cool! Better than I could ever do.\n\nAfter getting my library card, I explored the various floors throughout the library. This place is massive! Various items caught my eye. They let you borrow vinyls! Who does that!? I\u2019m over the moon!\n\nI didn\u2019t know that the San Francisco Public Library is a Government Information Center (GIC). It\u2019s very accessible to get documents from various levels of government.\n\nThe Government Information Center (GIC) provides free access to United States, California, San Francisco, and Bay Area regional agency government documents, and to materials on public policy, political science, public administration, and the law.\n\nI\u2019ll have to spend more time exploring the library system and its website to see how I can maximize the resources available to me. I want to support the library more. This is a lesson to utilize public libraries and other public resources available to constituents.\n\nGetting my library card was an easy experience. Everyone should be able to use the library. I'm excited to be spending a lot of time here! The important thing about the library is you don't have to buy anything to work on things or read a book.\n\nI got to check a book out!\n\nThis blog post was written at the main branch of the San Francisco Library. Thank you for the fast internet. <3", "label": "personal"}

I\u2019m late writing this post. I saw October was on the topic of multilingualism in a global Web *. I\u2019m very excited to write about this topic for various reasons. Exciting might be an understatement. I\u2019m fucking stoked to write a post about languages!\n\nI grew up as a bilingual in Spanish and English. Then, I learned French in school and the whole travel abroad situation. I consider myself fluent in all three languages. I use them often. As someone who speaks multiple languages, I see the world through different lenses. One could argue that the internet itself is another world. This has allowed me to access different parts of the internet that someone who is a monolingual may not ever get to experience much.\n\nWhen I was growing up and started to learn French: I was very happy to find content so easily. One of the shows, * Code Lyoko * was vital in my learning French. I was able to watch able to watch it in all three languages I speak. It helped make connections and differentiate how the characters expressed themselves in their respective language. Being born and raised in the United States, I have to admit that the multilingual has kept me connected with my roots, and my family and has taught me things. It allows my language skills to evolve as time goes on.\n\nI often use the Mexican version of Google to find the news and look up various things about Latin America. I get more direct to the source. I do this to find more accurate reporting on things happening. When things about Mexico get reported in American media, I often question various aspects of the reporting. American media tends to picture Mexico as this scary place as a whole.\n\nWhen I was a kid, It was hard to find information about my parents\u2019 hometown in Mexico. Trying to find detailed information in English was next to impossible. Wikipedia in Spanish is always a great place to start! It\u2019s so much more satisfying as the page has more information and a lot more footnotes. What better place than to look at a website by the Mexican government to give me the census data of my parent\u2019s hometown? You can\u2019t find this information in English!\n\nThe web shouldn\u2019t be dominated by the English language. I\u2019m aware it\u2019s the lingua franca. The internet is becoming homogenized. A world being homogenized is a terrifying thing to think about. We\u2019re losing so much culture. So much perspective. Think of it this way: the internet is losing its spice. It\u2019s becoming bland. We should be proud of the languages we can present ourselves in. That\u2019s what makes the internet fun! Does everything need to be in English? Absolutely N-O-T!\n\nI must admit that I am guilty of not writing as often in different languages. I do write the occasional post in Spanish or French. At the same time, I feel as if I\u2019m contributing to the situation. This month\u2019s topic has motivated me to continue to write in Spanish and French more. I want to continue to express myself. It\u2019s important to write in different languages other than English. When I write in different languages, I express myself as me but at the same time, it\u2019s a different me. French Pablo presents himself differently from Spanish or English Pablo.\n\nThank you ~zinricky for hosting this month\u2019s IndieWeb Carnival on multilingualism in a global Web", "label": "personal"}

I was very happy that I went with my friend!\n\nMy biggest achievement is I didn't fall on my face!

I also don't wan't to give too many spoilers.\n\nBooks:\n\nA Thousand Splendid Suns - Khaled Hosseini\n\nMaus / Maus II - Art Spiegelman\n\nA graphic novel where Spiegelman interviews his father about his experiences as a Polish Jew and Holocaust survivor. *I really enjoyed the various themes in the book.\n\nThis is a must read\n\n1984 - George Orwell\n\nThis taught me many lessons and how eerie this period of time is currently. I'm pretty scared for what's to come.\n\nThe Odyssey - Homer\n\nMany of the themes taught me some important lessons.\n\nIn The Hot Zone - Kevin Sites\n\nThis wasn't my favorite book but it made me aware of various wars and situations happening beyond Iraq.\n\nLady of the Lake - Sir Walter Scott\n\nYeruldelgger - Ian Manook (French)\n\nThis book me realize I can actually read French.\n\nRyan White My Own Story - Ryan White\n\nRyan White has always been an inspiration to me as I have in various periods of my life been involved with bringing awareness about HIV/AIDS. It fascinated me how well-versed Ryan was and his outlook on life as he was very unlucky getting the virus from tainted blood products.\n\nLe Gone du Cha\u00e2ba - Azouz Begag (French)\n\nLe Gone du Cha\u00e2ba (The Kid of the Chaaba), translated into English as Shantytown Kid by Naima Wolf.\n\nI love this book as it shows the struggles of balancing two different cultures - the country you live in and the culture at home. This book understood me in various ways as I struggled to balance US life and my Mexican culture.\n\nMy French Professor gave me this book as a graduation gift.\n\nRemaking Manhood: Stories From the Front Lines of Change - Mark Greene\n\nI read this book right before I graduated college. Being a male teacher is very important as many students don't have a good male role model at home. I made it a goal in my teaching to help my students not fall for certain behaviors.\n\nThis book also helped me reevaluate my relationships and look deep inside of me.\n\nHere's a good link related to Remaking Manhood\n\nWinning the War On War - Joshua S. Goldstein\n\nI minored in International Studies and this book really opened me up to deeper issues that continue to exist.\n\nConstructive Living - David K. Reynolds\n\nAlthough this book wasn't the solution to many of my problems during some very dark times, it has helped me address them and find the right direction. It has helped me get out of the rut.\n\nJourney To The Future: A Roadmap for Success for Youth - Consuelo Castillo Kickbusch (Author)\n\nThis book has helped me in various ways to get where I am today. Consuela is a great presenter!\n\nThe New Koreans: The Story of a Nation - Michael Breen", "label": "personal"}

Everyone and anyone is welcome to participate! I love reading posts in different languages!\n\nSend me a webmention or email me at pablo[at]lifeofpablo.com to submit your posts. I will create a round up post and i will update this blog post with the replies I receive!\n\nWhat is self-expression?\n\nThat depends\n\nself-expression (noun)\n\nself-ex\u00b7\u200bpres\u00b7\u200bsion \u02ccself-ik-\u02c8spre-sh\u0259n\n\nThe expression of one's personality : assertion of one's individual traits\n\nSelf-expression comes in various forms. It manifests differently in every person. There is no single route to how people develop how they become. People express themselves loudly, quietly, non-verbally, or in any other way. Many things influence us in our lives. The environment we grew up in influences how we present to the world. Our cultural backgrounds, the countries we've lived in, the languages we speak, or the type of supportive friends we have in our lives are all the ingredients that build the recipe for who we become and how we share our personalities with the world.\n\nFor me, I love speaking languages! I love playing games in French and being super duper competitive. I love reading in Spanish!\n\nI grew up in a Mexican household which has greatly influenced my ways of self-expression. I love speaking with more emotion at home and being surrounded by people with my cultural background. An example of this is when I am angry, I will cuss in Spanish like no other. I feel so much better after letting it all out. This Instagram reel in Spanish will tell you what I mean.\n\nThe Mexican culture influences my American side and vice versa. I would consider myself very expressive in English. Ever since I was a kid, I loved saying, \"That's so cute\" or \"That flower is so pretty.\" Sharing your emotions is very beautiful. Don't be afraid of saying things out loud like this. Fuck that toxic masculinity garbage!\n\nI love blogging and journaling. I love having a journal - getting lost in my thoughts while jotting them down on beautiful lined or dotted paper on a park bench or sitting crisscross applesauce on the top of a building in San Francisco. I love sharing my thoughts publicly blogging or quietly on paper. Not all forms of expression have to be public. Self-expression also includes time when it's you and only you involved. This includes recording audio notes, coding your new blog engine, or building an arcade cabinet. Alone time is self-expression.\n\nAs I've become older, I've stopped caring as much about what people perceive of me (or what I thought people perceived of me) in the things that interest me. Self-expression is about how comfortable you can be with yourself. It comes down to loving yourself more every day. I love dressing in bright colors, especially on a nice sunny day. It makes me feel great and brightens my mood. Heck, find me wearing the brightest pink shirt out in public in the streets of San Francisco.\n\nHow you view self-expression is open to interpretation. How do you self-express?\n\nHere are some questions to get you started to get the juices flowing:\n\nHow do you present yourself to the world?\n\nWhat does self-expression do for you?\n\nDo you use self-expression as a coping mechanism?\n\nWhat has been your journey to becoming a more expressive version of yourself?\n\nIf your family culture is different from the country that you live in, how do you balance your self-expression? Are they intertwined?\n\nAlso posted on IndieNews\n\nSubmissions", "label": "personal"}

Woohoo! I guess I\u2019m no longer a 20-something-year-old. These last 10 years have flown by quickly but man, have they been memorable. It\u2019s a tad bitter sweet. The positive overtakes the negative by a long shot. I can\u2019t stop the aging process. If only it were that easy!\n\nHonestly, at this very moment, I don\u2019t feel any different. I still feel energetic and craving adventure. I think these song lyrics from T-Swizzle describe how I feel.\n\n(Hey!) I don't know about you But I'm feeling twenty-two\n\nIn hindsight, looking at myself in the mirror more recently, I notice my facial hair is starting to turn white. Nothing like a fresh shave that still makes me look young and boyish. I must being doing something right with my skin routine (and maybe good genes from my parents)!\n\nReflections\n\nI reflect on the growth I\u2019ve had since I entered my 20s. My 20s were about\n\nLearning\n\nFalling and rising\n\nGoing on adventures.\n\nLoved ones\n\nI learned some great lessons along the way. Some lessons were not so easy to swallow. Man, did I learn. There are so many things I know now that I wish a 20-year-old me knew. One of the things I wish he knew was, \u201cLove yourself more!\u201d I do love myself more than ever. I\u2019m happier with who I\u2019ve become. I\u2019m not done learning who I become. I don\u2019t think that ever stops. There were many moments in life when I hit my absolute lowest. Those are moments I\u2019m not proud of. While I did manage to get myself out of them, I did come back stronger. Another lesson here - ask for help and use the resources available to you. You\u2019re not alone, I promise.\n\nTake risks! Take more! I'm thrilled to have moved to California. I still can\u2019t believe that this guy from Nebraska moved to San Francisco. I was grateful to have gone on so many adventures. I learned so much about myself getting away. Some of my best learning moments have been from strangers and experiences with myself in another country. Who knew you could learn something so new about yourself at 3 am while eating a d\u00f5ner kebab on the streets of Berlin?\n\nWhen I was in my early 20s, I said something along the lines of, \u201cI get to be away from my parents! Freedom!\u201d When I was in college, I didn\u2019t want to come home as often, or if I went home to visit, I would not stay for too long. Now more than ever, I miss my parents. Now, I live far away from them. I only get to have home-cooked meals a few times a year. It honestly makes me sad watching them get older. I still need my parents. I do my best to call every day. My relationship with them has been stronger than ever. I am thankful for all the things they\u2019ve done for me and my siblings\n\nWho\u2019s cutting the internet onions on here?\n\nTravel\n\nI\u2019m very fortunate that I traveled a lot in my 20s. I want to thank my parents for taking us to Mexico as a young kid.\n\nI\u2019ve traveled to Canada, all over Europe, South Korea, Mexico, and various parts of the United States.\n\nTravel Buddies\n\nI got to travel with my favorite travel buddies, Sammy and Manny! We've have gone on some wild adventures. I\u2019m very happy we stayed friends. Best travel buddies ever!\n\nBest Birthday Ever! - Czech Republic\n\nOne of my favorite birthdays was when I was studying abroad in Europe. I visited my friends in the Czech Republic.\n\nPablo\u2019s 22nd birthday in 2017 in Czech Republic]\n\nFriends\n\nI\u2019ve made an amazing community of friends. People, I consider my family away from home. Learning from people whom I loved, making friends wherever I go! I\u2019ve made so many friends.\n\nWhat goals do I have in my 30s?\n\nThere are a lot of things I want to accomplish during my 30s. I have a vision for the next few years! I\u2019m hopeful I can find the right path to reach my goals\n\nEducation\n\nI truly value education. It got me where I am today! I was very fortunate to receive a great public school education. Others also need to have access to a great public school education. We must fight against the privatization of the education system. I want to continue to fight for public education. Public education provided me with so many opportunities.\n\nI am currently doing my master\u2019s degree at the University of Nebraska Kearney. My goal one day is to teach a class or two at the university level. It would be awesome to guide future teachers and help them be confident with technology use and go beyond 21st-century learning. I do miss being in the classroom.\n\nI would like to receive a PhD.\n\nI also want to improve my programming skills.\n\nHealth\n\nI\u2019m working towards getting in better shape and thinking of long-term health. As I age, I know I won\u2019t bounce back from injury as quickly. I know I must do everything in my power to take control of my health. Preventative measures are what will keep the hospital away. Mental health is just as important.\n\nAdventures\n\nI want to continue traveling. I want to visit more parts of the world. Ever since I last renewed my passport, the visa pages have been blank. The passport I had in my early twenties was pretty full. It\u2019s so satisfying to look at the stamps and stickers on each page. I want to take my parents on a fun adventure as well\n\nStartup\n\nI\u2019ve been helping a friend with a startup and launching an idea that we have. I am hopeful this year will be great!\n\nFinancial Independence\n\nI want to make smarter choices with money. I\u2019ve been reading up on financial literature to become better with money. Times are changing, and I must keep up with inflation, changing markets, AI, etc.\n\nLooking Forward\n\nOverall, things are finally clicking. I\u2019m excited for what\u2019s to come and all the things to learn. I will reevaluate and reprioritize many things in life.\n\nWhat have you learned in your 30s?\n\nHow am I celebrating my birthday?\n\nLuckily, I live in San Francisco, so there\u2019s a lot to do! I will be celebrating the entire weekend with my friends in San Francisco! So stoked to watch Drag Disco with Trixie Mattel! Let\u2019s put on some pink clothes and dance into my 30s!", "label": "personal"}

But I\u2019m not having a crisis about my personal life choices\u2026 instead I\u2019m having a crisis of generational impotence. I\u2019m tired of waiting for my generation\u2019s turn, which I am less and less convinced will come in time to make a difference, especially since GenZ seems to be going conservative \ud83d\ude11\n\nOuter South by Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band\n\nI finally got letters back from two of my reps:\n\nSenator Murray, 74yo and in office since 1993 when I was in third grade, wants me to know that she \u201cremain[s] committed to continuing to work with [her] colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find ways to make progress on immigration reform.\u201d Thank you for your complacency Senator. I don\u2019t know how immigration progress will be made with isolationist Nazis tbh \ud83e\uddd0 I don\u2019t get why Dems are taking conservative immigration stances when in my mind the problem is we are too strict on immigration, and should let in more people. There, birth rate \u201ccrisis\u201d solved too! What I want to know now is, what are the Senator\u2019s plans for retirement?\n\nRepresentative DelBene\u2019s office thinks I \u201cmay be pleased to know that [she] joined [her] Democratic colleagues in sending a letter to President Trump expressing serious concern about Mr. Abrego Garcia\u2019s case and requesting an immediate update on his wellbeing and how the administration plans to ensure his safe return to the United States.\u201d I am, in fact, not pleased. I am the opposite of pleased. Is she fucking with me? Does she not go on the Internet? In what world am I satisfied that she signed a strongly worded letter and called it good?\n\nMy resentment towards 80yo politicians who won\u2019t retire and pass their power to the next generation is reaching a rolling boil as the Democrats in charge apparently don\u2019t have an ounce of urgency left in their moldering bodies. I have to think it\u2019s intentional, especially given the way Nancy and co blocked Millennial AOC from a position of power in favor of an old dude with cancer who just died from it (\u201cGerry\u2019s a young 74, cancer notwithstanding\u201d \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44); I think Boomer politicians know how badly they\u2019ve fucked over everyone younger than them, and they will literally hold power until they die to prevent facing justice. (Yeah I\u2019m making it generational, they\u2019ve been demonizing Millennials to avoid looking in the mirror for decades.) They booted 25yo David Hogg from DNC leadership as punishment for suggesting the party should not always support incumbents, making a mockery of DEI principles by using gender equality rules to invalidate his election.\n\nA friend and I just looked it up: Nancy Pelosi was first elected in 1987. She has been in power for basically my entire life. And I am turning 40. Her legacy, in my mind? Losing women the right to bodily autonomy, for not taking Republicans seriously and doing anything about it when she could have. OK fine she did get us the ACA. Thanks lady. But it\u2019s time to go home, get some rest, and let someone else have a turn! (Sorry Bernie, I love ya man, but you too!!!)\n\nI think those in charge should have some stakes in the game. If you\u2019re already past the actuarial tables, you shouldn\u2019t get to make decisions for the rest of us who are going to live in the world our politicians make for potentially decades. (I expect the Supreme Court will be ultra conservative for the rest of my life because Dems wouldn\u2019t dare trying to expand it.) Be a mentor, yes, please! But give up the power. Normal retirement age is 67. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ageist to suggest it might be time for someone two decades past retirement age to pass the torch.\n\nGive me a party with energy, give me politicians who fight! Oh, for an opposition party \ud83e\udd7a I don\u2019t have to agree 100% with them, if they\u2019d just have some gumption. Give me AOC energy, Shawn Fain energy, Pete Buttigieg (!) energy, Cory Booker energy, Chris Van Hollen energy, Kat Abughazaleh energy. Not whatever this pathetic excuse for \u201cleadership\u201d is. Walz had the energy and they told him to stuff it. Brilliant strategy guys.\n\nPlease, please tell me someone is primarying all my Federal reps next election, because I will vote for anyone who shows some semblance of spine \ud83d\ude21", "label": "personal"}

I\u2019ve made so many friends.\n\nWhat goals do I have in my 30s?\n\nThere are a lot of things I want to accomplish during my 30s. I have a vision for the next few years! I\u2019m hopeful I can find the right path to reach my goals\n\nEducation\n\nI truly value education. It got me where I am today! I was very fortunate to receive a great public school education. Others also need to have access to a great public school education. We must fight against the privatization of the education system. I want to continue to fight for public education. Public education provided me with so many opportunities.\n\nI am currently doing my master\u2019s degree at the University of Nebraska Kearney. My goal one day is to teach a class or two at the university level. It would be awesome to guide future teachers and help them be confident with technology use and go beyond 21st-century learning. I do miss being in the classroom.\n\nI would like to receive a PhD.\n\nI also want to improve my programming skills.\n\nHealth\n\nI\u2019m working towards getting in better shape and thinking of long-term health. As I age, I know I won\u2019t bounce back from injury as quickly. I know I must do everything in my power to take control of my health. Preventative measures are what will keep the hospital away. Mental health is just as important.\n\nAdventures\n\nI want to continue traveling. I want to visit more parts of the world. Ever since I last renewed my passport, the visa pages have been blank. The passport I had in my early twenties was pretty full. It\u2019s so satisfying to look at the stamps and stickers on each page. I want to take my parents on a fun adventure as well\n\nStartup\n\nI\u2019ve been helping a friend with a startup and launching an idea that we have. I am hopeful this year will be great!\n\nFinancial Independence\n\nI want to make smarter choices with money. I\u2019ve been reading up on financial literature to become better with money. Times are changing, and I must keep up with inflation, changing markets, AI, etc.\n\nLooking Forward\n\nOverall, things are finally clicking. I\u2019m excited for what\u2019s to come and all the things to learn. I will reevaluate and reprioritize many things in life.\n\nWhat have you learned in your 30s?\n\nHow am I celebrating my birthday?\n\nLuckily, I live in San Francisco, so there\u2019s a lot to do! I will be celebrating the entire weekend with my friends in San Francisco! So stoked to watch Drag Disco with Trixie Mattel! Let\u2019s put on some pink clothes and dance into my 30s!", "label": "personal"}

It wasn\u2019t ever as big as my parent\u2019s, but I had ~50-70 jazz CDs (donated to the local HS music department so hopefully someone\u2019s still using them) plus probably a hundred albums.

I\u2019ve only bought one or two CDs a year for the past decade, indie bands I wanted to give some extra support (and listen in the car).\n\nThere\u2019s something about having a tangible object that makes it easier to flip through your collection and pull out things you haven\u2019t listened to in a while.

They both really needed replacing. We\u2019d hoped to have it done before the winter started since our furnace had already been on the fritz for several years \u2014 but the equipment was on backorder.\n\nMy energy utility, Puget Sound Energy (PSE), wants people to stay on gas, so there weren\u2019t incentives from them for this switch; however, my city developed a bulk purchase and incentive program to assist homeowners in transitioning to support the community\u2019s climate goals. This upgrade electrified our whole house, so we could shut off our gas service!*\n\nNow that I\u2019ve had a heat pump for a year, I wanted to share my experience, because I had questions and misconceptions that I didn\u2019t get answered beforehand. Tl;dr it\u2019s great, especially the cooling, just works a little differently.\n\n(Heads-up: 2500 word post, but it\u2019s got graphs! \ud83e\udd29)\n\n*Technically we still have a gas fireplace installed, but we never used it. PSE said it was safe to simply turn off even if that means there might be a small amount of gas remaining in the pipes under the house.\n\nWhy we got a heat pump\n\nOur old setup was failing\n\nBefore the upgrade, we had a ~20 year old gas furnace and an old gas water heater. In November 2019, a pipe on our water heater ruptured, spraying a ton of scalding water into our garage ceiling, filling the entire garage with steam that we had to hire a company to install fans for days to dry out. After that, the furnace began to fail regularly, falsely tripping the safety shut-off and needing to be restarted multiple times a day. We had people out to fix it multiple times, but the most they could figure was that something inside was corroded and they\u2019d clean it to buy us another few months.\n\nMy husband\u2019s telecommuted for years, and during the pandemic, I started working from home too \u2014 but the only \u201ccooling\u201d we had was a ceiling fan in our living room and dining room. We bought a used portable electric window A/C unit to keep my husband\u2019s office from turning into an inferno, and hefted it down the hall to our bedroom in the evenings. Less than ideal.\n\nNatural gas is terrible for the planet and for people\n\n\u201cNatural gas\u201d is the greenwashed industry name for methane, an extremely potent greenhouse gas. A lot of methane is fracked, which may have impacts on the health of surrounding communities. Methane is piped, often through First Nation people\u2019s lands without permission \u2014 think Keystone XL and Canada\u2019s Coastal GasLink pipeline \u2014 where it may leak and harm the water and ecosystem. Also, some methane leaks during fracking and distribution, contributing to emissions.\n\nMoreover, \u201cnatural gas\u201d is propped up by corporate propaganda that cooking with gas is better than electric, despite the atrocious impact methane has on indoor air quality and its contribution to household emissions. I have an electric stove, so I didn\u2019t have to replace mine in order to get off gas.\n\nWithout gas-burning appliances, our risk of carbon monoxide poisoning is lowered; it would come from some other source, like operating a propane stove indoors (DO NOT DO THAT THING). My husband knows someone who has brain damage from carbon monoxide poisoning!\n\nBasically, \u201cnatural gas\u201d is fucking shit and I want fucking nothing to do with it.\n\nMy new all-electric home energy setup\n\nMy house is about 1400s.f. and has two stories. It was built in the 1980s and our attic doesn\u2019t have enough insulation (we\u2019ve replaced insulation in the basement but not yet dealt with the attic).\n\nMitsubishi heat pump air handler (SVZ-KP24NA) \u2014 24,000 BTU/hour\n\nGeneral Aire residential whole-house air cleaner (GFI #4422 or 4424)\n\nMitsubishi wall head (split-type air conditioner MSZ-GL15NA) \u2014 one unit installed on second floor \u2014 we considered a second but decided to save $$$\n\n\n\n50-gallon electric water heater \u2014 the installer recommended against tankless despite what I\u2019d read online \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\n18-panel / 5.04kW solar system (Itek IT280 photovoltaic modules and Itek Theia HE\u2010t UL 3.8 kW inverter) \u2014 installed in 2015\n\nThe air handler connects to our existing duct system. There\u2019s the outdoor unit, which we placed on the side of the house directly below the upstairs heat pump head, and there\u2019s also the air cleaner in the garage where the old furnace was.\n\nThe city bulk purchase program we went through offered Mitsubishi heat pumps, and we just went with what the contractor recommended.\n\nHow much did the heat pump and electric water heater cost?\n\nI am located in the Seattle area, which has been in a housing boom for a while so contractors are pretty expensive.\n\nThe heat pump cost $19,445 + 10.2% tax for equipment and installation. The permit cost $236.*\n\nThe electric water heater with new dedicated 220v circuit cost $2,145 + 10.2% tax.\n\nOur city provided a $500 incentive and coordinated a $1,200 discount for bulk purchase of equipment, so in total we paid $22,155 for both heat pump and new water heater.\n\n*The permit included an inspection, which failed the first time \u2014 we wouldn\u2019t have known what wasn\u2019t installed quite right, so thanks inspector! He was super helpful and pointed out some other unrelated things he noticed that we might consider acting on.\n\nHeat pump vs. gas furnace energy use comparisons\n\nMy situation will not be directly comparable to most people\u2019s because we have a solar array, but hopefully will still provide a relative comparison. I have provided the electricity we used, which includes power we generated and used directly, but not power we generated and sold back to PSE.\n\nUnfortunately since we upgraded the water heater at the same time, we can\u2019t isolate only the cost of the heat pump \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nObnoxiously, our power bill comes mid-month. To make life easier for myself in the graphs, I\u2019ve represented the month the bill was issued. That typically covers usage from the 18th of the previous month through the 17th of the billing month \ud83d\ude15\n\nContext: weather and energy trends in the Pacific Northwest\n\nFor usage context, in the Seattle area, it\u2019s relatively cool (and we run heating) from mid September through early June. Summer is usually relatively moderate, typically peaking with one or two weeks in the 90s (F). Over 100F is unusual.\n\nHow much more electricity did the heat pump use?\n\nThese data represent solely our electricity use, so you can guesstimate how much electricity we use for heating (and cooling) by how much our electricity increased after January 2023. During the cold months (December through March bills), we used about 1200-1500 additional kWh (for heating our space and water). Over the whole year, we used an additional 7300kWh compared to the previous year. (According to PSE, it\u2019s typical to use about 2800kWh annually for an electric water heater and 6800kWh for a heat pump, or 9600kWh annually.)\n\nYou\u2019ll see that we had a big jump in electricity use in January 2024 (technically mid December through mid January). This coincides with an extremely cold snap for Washington, with temperatures in the ~19 degree Fahrenheit range for about a week. We didn\u2019t adjust our thermostat during that time period, but did run the heat pump head overnight as well as pulled out a small standalone electric space heater to help keep the house warmer during the day.\n\nMonthly kWh electricity used, Sept. 16 2021-Jan. 17, 2024 Month 2021 2022 2023 2024 kWh difference\n\nwith heat pump 1 499 495 1946 1451 2 419 *1044 *625 3 545 1737 1192 4 681 1617 936 5 695 1120 425 6 531 993 462 7 1003 1213 210 8 1212 1059 -153 9 868 973 105 10 577 721 880 159 11 466 541 1274 733 12 430 500 1651 1151\n\nbold = electric only \u2014 heat pump installed January 30, 2023\n\n* About half the February 2023 billing cycle was on gas heat\n\n\n\nHow much methane usage did we eliminate?\n\nIn 2022, we used 770 therms of methane.* Now, we use none! \ud83d\ude4c\n\n*According to PSE, a typical house uses 690 therms for a gas furnace and 160 therms for a gas water heater, or 850 therms annually.\n\nComparing gas therms and kWh electricity\n\nA therm is equal to approximately 29 kWh. Unless I\u2019m being totally unreasonable in converting and combining these values, here\u2019s how the overall kWh shakes out \u2014 a massive reduction in energy used with the heat pump (Feb 2023-Jan 2024):\n\nHow much did it cost to run the heat pump versus the gas furnace?\n\nThe first month we used the heat pump for cooling, I was braced for a radical energy bill, but thanks to our solar panels, we continued to pay the minimum electrical charge in summer \ud83e\uddbe\n\nIn actual costs, we paid $1435 for energy (gas and electricity) in 2022 and $1158 in 2023 (heat pump only); if we assumed that the four summer months of 2022 were $7.95 as in a normal year, that would still put 2022 at $1215. And if we swapped in this year\u2019s all-electric January bill for last year\u2019s gas-heated bill, that\u2019s basically a wash. And now we have whole-house cooling in summer \ud83d\ude0e\n\nMonthly energy bill by year, Sept. 16 2021-Jan. 17, 2024 Month 2021 2022 2023 2024 1 $218.41 *$229.79 $260.96 2 $158.67 $202.26 3 $148.30 $188.41 4 $108.26 $91.73 5 $79.85 $28.09 6 $51.67 $7.95 7 *$36.18 $7.95 8 *$76.16 $7.95 9 *$86.90 $7.95 10 $71.32 *$84.62 $46.02 11 $101.87 *$161.19 $136.05 12 $143.28 *$224.62 $204.68\n\nbold = electric only \u2014 heat pump installed January 30, 2023\n\n* = our solar inverter was not selling electricity back to PSE these months, though was generating power for pass-through usage \u2014 in a normal year the summer month costs would be the minimum $7.95 \u2014 this also means there was no bank to draw from for those fall and winter months\n\nWhat I wish we\u2019d known before switching to a heat pump\n\nIt heats differently than a gas furnace: slow and steady versus bursts of heat\n\nThe first month we had our heat pump, in the cold of February 2023, I was convinced it was broken or we\u2019d been sold too small of a unit. If you go in with expectations that it\u2019s going to be a different heating experience than a gas furnace, you\u2019ll be happier than I was at first \ud83d\ude09\n\nBeing used to a gas furnace, we were used to saying, \u201cIt\u2019s cold!\u201d and bumping the thermostat* up a couple degrees, then getting the immediate feedback of a big blast of hot air and a relatively quick increase in temperature.\n\nIn contrast, the heat pump blows air lightly all day long**. If we increase the thermostat setting, it will take several hours to reach the new temperature. Likewise, when it\u2019s too cold out, sometimes it has a hard time keeping up. (I\u2019m hoping that upping our attic insulation will help hold the temperature better.)\n\n*We had a Nest before, but I don\u2019t think it actually helped save energy since we were home all day every day, so between that and Google\u2019s creepy surveillance I was fine when I found out the heat pump came with a thermostat and wouldn\u2019t work with the Nest. Unfortunately, the included thermostat is kind of annoying to program.\n\n**Because heat pumps blow constantly, the contractor recommended keeping as many vents open as possible \u2014 closing no more than one or two. (There was a technical reason for this that I forget, something about making part of the heat pump get too cold and shut down.) Unfortunately, whoever installed our original HVAC system was, er, clearly the low bidder, so we have wacky vents directly underneath windows and doors all over the house \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f The register that blows the hottest is our downstairs bathroom \ud83d\ude44\n\nSo, with the heat pump, we don\u2019t drop the temperature overnight as much as we did with the gas furnace. We keep the house a more consistent temperature all the time. Then, the poor heat pump isn\u2019t always struggling to keep up, it just holds what it\u2019s got.\n\nThe heads aren\u2019t as quiet as they\u2019re made out to be\n\nWhoever says they\u2019re basically silent hasn\u2019t paid much attention. The heat pump head (which is in our bedroom) makes mysterious noises pretty often, particularly when in heating mode*. My poor cat Mina stares at it, transfixed in horror, as it tinkles like broken glass going through the wash, whooshes like the house is blasting off, brrrs to life unexpectedly, and whirs as the louvers rotate up and down randomly. It sometimes makes noise even when the unit is turned off, which is confusing.\n\nThe fan noises are relatively quiet, especially in comparison with a window AC unit, so that\u2019s probably the frame of reference people have when they talk about it being silent. But it\u2019s not silent if you\u2019re changing from forced air, which actually is basically silent \ud83d\ude09 Overall, it\u2019s not too intrusive and totally worth it for being able to fine-tune the comfort level of our bedroom, but not quite what I had anticipated.\n\n*I am pretty sensitive to noise, but my husband and cats agree on this one \ud83d\ude09\n\nOur verdict: the heat pump is a huge win for summer, good for winter\n\nIt kicks ass in summer\n\nWow, after previously not having cooling in summer, it was incredible to be able to comfortably use my office after like 3pm in the summer \ud83d\ude02 I was especially the beneficiary because in the past my husband got the portable A/C unit since his office was hotter.\n\nThe heat pump couldn\u2019t keep up with the hottest days in the high nineties, but even then still kept the house in comfortable mid to high eighties \u2014 totally fine for us, especially with a ceiling fan.\n\nGood in normal cold, fine in cold cold\n\nOnce we learned how to program the thermostat appropriately, we\u2019ve been happy with how the heat pump keeps the house warm.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest: this thing struggles with the cold cold (below freezing). From my understanding, actually cold places use a backup furnace IIRC, but the temperature\u2019s generally moderate enough in Seattle that we get by with just a heat pump and suck it up for the one or two extra-cold weeks a year.\n\nDuring our recent cold snap, when it was 16 degrees Fahrenheit overnight one night, the house was 55 degrees when we went downstairs in the morning despite the thermostat being set to 68. It didn\u2019t heat up much during the morning, so we pulled out our little electric space heater and an electric heating pad to boost the warmth, and bundled up with down vests and blankets. This is where the heat pump head is key: we were able to keep our bedroom, where the head is located, comfortable overnight (though we did add extra blankets).\n\nAnd honestly? The heat pump\u2019s so much more efficient, better for the climate, and safer for us that wearing a jacket for a week or two in the winter seems like a totally reasonable tradeoff.", "label": "personal"}

We have collected seeds and plants from Tibet, Europe and elsewhere and enjoy a very English style profusion with lawn and intertwined stairs and hidden trails.\u201d (This garden was very much my vibe.)\n\nTakeaways\n\nIt\u2019s lovely to see stunning gardens like these, but also having paid for landscaping, I have to distinguish between what someone could accomplish with many tens of thousands of dollars of hardscaping and what could be adaptable to my yard. Some of the gardens leaned on sweat equity and cleverness, which is what my budget calls for \ud83d\ude09 Boulders are $$$ as much as I love how they look \ud83e\udd7a (Our landscape plan originally called for a fountain but the landscaper wasn\u2019t willing to wait for electricity to be trenched, since it would need an inspection, even though they saw the plans when we got the quote \ud83d\ude44 so, we have a bird bath)\n\nI think some cheapish landscaping cobblestones, metal arches, and more yard art could go a fair ways to adding finish to my garden. I also suspect another couple Japanese maples could pull things together. More paths / focal points in the backyard would be beneficial visually \u2014 we didn\u2019t bother because the freeway is so loud we just wanted it to look pretty out the window \u2014 but I\u2019m finding that there is a lack of places for the eye to land when it\u2019s all green all the time. Without a lawn, and with the path so close to the house you can\u2019t see it from inside, we have few \u201cedges\u201d.", "label": "personal"}

Outright fascism is worse, but there are plenty of things we need to change. Kat Abughazaleh, who\u2019s running for office in Illinois, says:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason every American should not be able to afford housing, groceries, health insurance, public transit (ideally), and then still have enough money to save and take your kid to the zoo or go to the movies with your friends. There\u2019s just, there\u2019s no reason \u2014 we are the wealthiest country in the world. The idea that that\u2019s unrealistic or idealistic or naive or even called childish, I think that\u2019s sucky.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t have to settle for returning to a normal that sucks \u2014 but protest may not be enough to force change. Our current situation has been the Republican gameplan for decades; we will not escape it by liberating ourselves from a single politician. Trump is a symptom, but the rot runs much deeper. We need to reckon emotionally with the long fights ahead; protests alone will not solve our problems. I\u2019m not saying protest isn\u2019t helpful or important \u2014 I\u2019m saying that we need to find space for both brunch and advocacy in our lives. Micah L. Sifry writes:\n\nOne of the most inspiring ways that pro-democracy movements grow their strength is by inventing and spreading ways for the silent majority to make itself both visible and influential.\n\nI\u2019ve been seeing organizers talking about the need to transform the current energy into long-term work, and not let it fizzle out. Jared Yates Sexton describes the way that authorities rein in public speech:\n\nWe are, according to those who want nothing more than to maintain control, supposed to protest enough, but not too much. Because we should rely on them. Because we need to maintain our subservient position under the party as opposed to in conversation and discourse with the party.\n\nOne strategy: focusing on local advocacy and building up\n\nMy pet theory is that most people should spend their advocacy time supporting local (and state) efforts, and donate to organizations advocating at the federal level. The collapse of local news and intense media focus on national politics encourages people to feel powerless because at the federal level most of what you can do is harass your senator. It also frames politics as something \u201cyou do\u201d once every four years for normies, every two years for the passionate, every election for the wonks and zealots. If you get people involved in local politics, I imagine that get-out-the-vote drives become a lot easier because people are already tuned in.\n\nThe local level is more influential than people realize, I suspect. In Washington State, how environmental policies often play out is that they get implemented at either King County or City of Seattle first, then several suburban cities, and then there\u2019s a model and coalition for building a state-level policy. As former city staff, I can say it\u2019s no accident it works this way \u2014 we knew our colleagues at other cities and would learn from each other, sharing lessons and draft policy language. Regional organizations support, both partnering with cities and going down to Olympia during the legislative session to advocate for (and against) bills. We know that Republicans followed a similar model in the evil direction in red states, building up a portfolio of harmful policies to bring to the federal level in the form of Project 2025\u2026 why don\u2019t we do the same for progressive policies?\n\nIf we start thinking and working now, we can set things up for the next state legislative session, then the next federal election, then the presidential election. (I\u2019m not going down rabbitholes about martial law, I don\u2019t find it helpful to indulge in that kind of despairing fatalism \u2014 I think my personal work on managing catastrophic thinking and anxiety has paid dividends here.)\n\nI haven\u2019t decided what bigger thing I want to work on yet\u2026 for now I\u2019ve just been doing ad hoc advocacy when it\u2019s pointed out by the urbanist Discord server I\u2019m in. I\u2019m pissed that Washington had a school lunch bill that failed in the legislative session, so potentially supporting another run at that\u2026 or badgering the governor about Washington\u2019s regressive taxation policy and demanding an income tax on the wealthiest Washingtonians, which he put the kibosh on this budget cycle and was why the budget was too tight to feed kids \ud83d\ude44 Come on, Bob! We have a lot of tech companies \u2014 and tech CEOs \u2014 here who could stand to pay their fair share. Or I could go harder on supporting housing; I just looked at King County\u2019s affordable housing dashboard, which identifies a need for 44,000 affordable units by 2024, and THE ENTIRE SEATTLE AREA HAD BUILT FEWER THAN FIVE THOUSAND UNITS by 2022. *screaming*\n\nOrganizing coalitions\n\nI\u2019m also spinning on the provocation of the second method of organizing described in the Win the Midwest\u2019s 10-year report (emphasis mine):\n\nThere are two approaches to base building. We can ask what we are for, and then go out and find the people who agree with us. Or we can begin by asking who we need to organize in order to build enough power to shift everything, and then go where they are: workplaces, churches, mosques, synagogues, schools, and childcare centers. Grassroots organizations that meet people where they are \u2013 physically and ideologically \u2013 and that create spaces of belonging, learning, and formation rooted in people\u2019s lives and experiences have an unlimited number of people to organize. Most people do not have clearly defined political outlooks, but they can move into public leadership roles. Organizations willing to put their base at the center of their plans can co-create a political agenda that emerges from the lived experience of their bases.\n\nI\u2019m an extremely opinionated person, and I know what outcomes I want (though I\u2019d rather listen to others on the best tactics on achieving those outcomes), but maybe I could think of this as prioritizing which outcomes to focus on based on which ones enough other people also want and will fight for. L.A. Kauffman discusses building coalitions with those we disagree with, quoting a 1981 talk / 1983 essay \u201cCoalition Politics: Turning the Century\u201d:\n\n\u201cThe reason we are stumbling,\u201d Dr. [Bernice] Reagon declared all those years ago, \u201cis that we are at the point where in order to take the next step we\u2019ve got to do it with some folk we don\u2019t care too much about. And we got to vomit over that for a little while. We must just keep going.\u201d\n\nFurther reading:\n\nWhy Do Anything? by Dj Bracken \u2014 this guy decided to start paying down student lunch debt in Utah, and eventually helped get a statewide bill passed (I was loosely involved in supporting new \u201cshare tables\u201d / fridges at our local elementary schools, AMA)\n\nFrom Aspiration to Action: Organizing Through Exhaustion, Grief, and Uncertainty by Kelly Hayes\n\nSee also:\n\nDon\u2019t let them say it\u2019s normal\n\nExtending my understanding of self-care\n\nBeing a citizen means taking ownership", "label": "personal"}
{"title": "Creating rituals: remembering Coach Taylor \u2013 Tracy Durnell's Mind Garden", "url": "https://tracydurnell.com/2024/08/16/creating-rituals-remembering-coach-taylor/", "content": "My high school track and cross country coach Mr. Taylor was a master at creating rituals and culture. A former seminary student who was obsessed with ancient Greece, he started each practice with a philosophy discussion. He wove in, too, tales of past runners and triumphs \u2014 he\u2019d been coach for nearly thirty years already \u2014 creating our own pantheon of heroes, the team\u2019s own mythos. Who of us would one day join its ranks?\n\nMr. Taylor recognized how much the mind and body are connected. He treated our labor seriously, and expected us to do the same. Excellence \u2014 ar\u00eate \u2014 was our goal. I\u2019ll admit that plenty of times I tuned out the talk, but there was something about sitting down as a team to transition from school to sport, using that time to mentally prepare for the physical work.\n\nOne of my favorite rituals was to honor outgoing seniors on the cross-country team. At the final home race of the season, each senior released one of his homing pigeons. (I was annoyed because I had to share a pigeon \ud83d\ude02) As far as I can remember, there was no special meaning to this, it just was a thing that he made happen each year. A created ceremony we nonetheless looked forward to; simply having some marker, however arbitrary, gave the season an emotional culmination beyond the final race, recognition of our contributions to the team regardless of how we placed.\n\nHe built the team\u2019s culture through these shared rites and rituals, building a sense of continuity with past runners both at our school and at the origins of track in Ancient Greece.\n\nI can\u2019t talk about ritual and Mr. Taylor without also talking about Ar\u00eate West. Starting in 1979, every other year he took a group of about eight students from the track or cross country team to Greece. At first, they went to compete, but over the years it shifted into more of a philosophical journey and extended into greater Europe. Over the course of twenty trips, the experience developed its own rituals. (I went on trip thirteen.)\n\nThe first: secret invitation. My best friend hounded me, but I wouldn\u2019t confess that I\u2019d received The Postcard telling me when and where our first meeting would be. (We met every other week throughout the school year to study and prepare for the trip.) We all showed up that first night unsure who the seven other voyagers would be. In my year, the eighth person no-showed \u2014 we never found out who else had been invited and declined to join.\n\nThe trip itself teemed with rituals. My least favorite involved running through the hot, dusty Greek countryside to an ancient track where we were expected to take off our shoes and run a lap in bare feet, like the runners of old. On Ithaca, we ran, separately, to \u201cTelemachos\u2019 beach\u201d. In Delphi, we were meant to sleep in \u201cthe meadow\u201d where many past Arete trips had slept (but he couldn\u2019t find it in the twilight, so we slept on a random dirt road \ud83d\ude12 Apparently on my sister\u2019s trip there was a dead dog in the meadow and they said no fucking way).\n\nMr. Taylor believed strongly in the power of place and designed the experience to provoke encounters with meaning. (Some more successful than others\u2026) I lugged my clarinet across Europe so I could play Mozart\u2019s clarinet concerto outside the building where he died (?). Everywhere we went, one or another of us had been assigned topics to present on or locations to give a reading. (I botched my reading from The Agony and The Ecstasy at the Vatican and read a passage about the wrong Michaelangelo Mother and Child sculpture \ud83e\udd23) Overlooking the Acropolis, one of the boys had to read us Pericles\u2019s funeral speech, as each trip had done before us. In Sils Maria, we walked in Nietzsche\u2019s footsteps and discussed quotes at various waypoints along the trail. Our trip was our own, yet inextricably linked with previous trips through shared touchstones and repeated experiences: rituals meant to connect us to the past, both modern and ancient.\n\nThis is my contribution to the August IndieWeb Blog Carnival, hosted by Steve Ledlow on the theme of ritual.", "label": "personal"}
{"title": "A world run by tools", "url": "https://tommorris.org/posts/2024/a-world-run-by-tools/", "content": "Tantek just wrote an interesting post about writing tools, part of an IndieWeb Carnival for last month on tools.\n\nThis is partly a response to Tantek\u2019s post with some suggestions, but also explaining how I pick tools, and explaining a few I use.\n\nZuhandenheit\n\nIf I\u2019m trying to think, or learn something important or come up with ideas, my first port of call is to take notes by hand. There\u2019s some scientific evidence that writing by hand is better if you want to learn stuff, but I also just like writing by hand more. It\u2019s calming and it feels nice. Computers are filled with bugs, security vulnerabilities, bad software, corproate unpleasantness, and endless distractions. None of the things I dislike most about computers are present in pens and notebooks.\n\nI use hardbound notebooks (I\u2019ve tried a variety of brands, but I prefer 120gsm paper and pre-printed page numbers), and black uni-ball Eye UB-157 pens with 0.7mm nibs. I have some of the 1.0mm ones too, but they\u2019re a bit much. I used fountain pens at school and have no particular desire to go back to that particular mess. I used to use another brand of gel pens where you could replace the ink rather than having to dispose of the whole thing when it runs out, which would be a plus.\n\nThe stuff I write down may end up being typed up and stored in a digital system, but about 80% of the time, what I write starts on paper.\n\nThose with an optimizing mindset might find it a bit strange to duplicate effort in this way. Write stuff by hand and then type it into a digital system? Why?\n\nFor me, writing notes and ideas by hand is an important first stage. There are fewer distractions in a notebook. If you write digitally, you go immediately into editing mode - rewriting words, cutting and pasting, chopping and changing. Sometimes that\u2019s important, but there\u2019s an advantage to just letting the thoughts sit around for a bit before getting the scalpel out.\n\n\u201cSure, but what about an iPad with a Apple Pencil? Or a reMarkable? Or just scanning your notebook and using handwriting recognition?\u201d asks a conveniently invented interlocuter.\n\nIf those work for you, great. I have tried taking notes on an iPad with a stylus, and it\u2019s\u2026 fine. I was curious about the reMarkable, but then they added bloody subscription fees. I already have a notebook and a pen. Spending hundreds of pounds on another gadget, plus having to deal with tech nonsense like susbcription fees, and USB chargers - and, for what? I already have a notebook. It\u2019s good.\n\nThe second second stage of typing it up into a digital system isn\u2019t a problem that needs solving, it\u2019s a purposeful decision. The typing up stage is where I add context, reorder and restructure the ideas to make them more coherent, work out what needs to happen with the information\u2014see how things hang together in the broadest possible sense of the term, that kinda thing. Often times, the typing up stage will involve digging out links, finding references, double-checking stuff.\n\nSeparating thinking and writing into separate stages works for me. It takes time, but if the end result is better ideas or clearer understanding, that\u2019s time well spent.\n\nMinimally cursed technology\n\nIn terms of how I pick digital tools, I\u2019m not an free/open source purist, but my starting point is I want stable forever software, free of corporate control, that uses formats that are open, widely-implemented and simple. If it is open source, all the better. If it isn\u2019t, I treat it as considerably more disposable than I do free software.\n\nThere\u2019s commercial software I use which is pay once, or where there\u2019s an \u201cannual pass\u201d type approach that unlocks new features. I avoid SaaS and subscriptionware, not because of the cost, but because of the control. I don\u2019t trust stuff to not go away.\n\nThere are morally disgusting elements in the software industry\u2014Adobe just referred to Creative Cloud users as heroin addicts, and I want no part of that. But there is an incredibly pragmatic, commercial argument for preferring software that\u2019s open source (or at least closer to the Platonic ideal): it seems incredibly risky to hand over control of the tools one relies on to work effectively to companies whose commercial incentives do not necessarily align with your own. They can screw you over at any time, and you\u2019ve got no practical recourse. This is true of everybody whose job involves using technology, which, these days, is practically everyone. It\u2019s true of knowledge workers\u2014scientists, designers, software developers, lawyers, civil servants, journalists\u2014having control over the tools of their work, but it is also just as true of rural farmers being able to repair their tractors or doctors being able to fix ventilators during a global pandemic (they ended up getting more help from a Polish hacker than from the medical device manufacturers).\n\nOn open data, the near guaranteed way to achieve this is plain text. That\u2019s it. The closer to plain text it is, the better.\n\nI\u2019ve worked in companies where our beautifully curated bug tracker\u2014which, along with the commit history, is the closest thing to an oral history of a software project\u2014disappeared because someone decides that they prefer a different system. God only knows why\u2014 it\u2019s 40\u00a2 per user per month cheaper, the sales guy took them for a nice lunch, the icon is a nicer shade of blue. Nobody transferred the data. All the links to the bugs are broken. The consequence? The developers have no idea what happened before last week because it\u2019s all disappeared. If it\u2019s not in text/plain or something close to it (Markdown, HTML, etc.), it dies. If it is in plain text or something close to it, you can version control it, which is handy.\n\nI cannot emphasise enough how important plain text is. It\u2019s unreasonably effective, one might say. The fact that in knowledge-based workplaces and professions, only programmers seem to grasp the significance of this is incredibly strange.\n\nImplementation\n\nIn terms of electronic tooling, my first ports of call for writing are Emacs and Obsidian. Emacs is mostly for code, Obsidian is mostly for prose, but there\u2019s some overlap.\n\nFor Emacs, I use the Doom distro. I used Vim for a long time, and evil-mode gives me Vim but I can customise it more to my needs. In practice, I don\u2019t customise very much, but Emacs Lisp is preferable to Vimscript. And my Emacs setup looks pretty.\n\nWhen it comes to programming, my go-to languages these days are Python and Rust (plus, I guess, Elisp).\n\nAs for Obsidian, it\u2019s where pretty much everything that\u2019s not code and is of longer term importance ends up. It\u2019s a personal wiki, basically. Some people like to call them \u201czettelkastens\u201d or \u201cpersonal knowledge management systems\u201d but I just say \u201cpersonal wiki\u201d. Everything goes in there - notes on interesting things I read, hard-fought lessons, lists of films and music to try.\n\nIt is a genuine extended mind though. The main benefit is thought not going to waste. I\u2019ve been in discussions with people, and we\u2019ve been trying to understand something - I can pull up information from my personal wiki and refresh myself on what did I think when I encountered this thing in the past, and why.\n\nI don\u2019t love Obsidian (it not being open source being one problem). Logseq is promising (and actually open source), but I\u2019ve been too busy to switch over. I\u2019ve tried org-mode and I like it, but Org mode keybindings are weird and I\u2019m too lazy to change them. Plus there isn\u2019t really good mobile tooling in Org-mode world.\n\nBoth Obsidian and Logseq are just plain text which I trust far more than whatever rat-infested proprietary crap is popular until it gets sunsetted or pivoted or screwed up.\n\nIn theory, how you sync Obsidian (and Logseq) is up to you. In practice, if you\u2019re on macOS/iOS, you\u2019ve got a couple of options:\n\niCloud Drive - it\u2019s built into the OS after all\n\nDropbox / Google Drive / whatever - I\u2019ve moved away from them\n\nsome self-hosted thing - Resilio Sync, Syncthing, WebDAV etc.\n\nObsidian\u2019s paid for sync service which is probably lovely but it is $20 a month, no thanks\n\nGit - it\u2019s plain text, version control it\n\nThe latter is great but fiddly if you want to sync between iOS and desktop. This tutorial explains exactly how to do it correctly with Working Copy. Doing it any other way is a recipe for pain and unpleasantness.\n\n(The other way to do it is to have a Git copy, and then some kind of way to sync it to a cloud storage system without the Git repo, then pull the changes back in. Essentially that\u2019s what the Working Copy/Shortcuts trick is doing on iOS.)\n\nI\u2019ve bounced back and forth between Apple Notes and Bear for more trivial, throw-away stuff. Ultimately, that is for short-lived stuff - the important stuff gets checked into the personal wiki, because text/plain wins.\n\nIn terms of this blog, it uses Hugo. Why? Dunno. It\u2019s alright. I chose it because it\u2019s a single binary, and I had previously gotten utterly bored of RubyGems and Python virtualenvs and all that dependency management stuff. There\u2019s stuff I don\u2019t like about it, but I don\u2019t really have time to fix all the issues now.\n\nGo make stuff\n\nWriting and reading about tools is fun, but it is a whole lot of empty calories.\n\nPick the least bad option, try to exercise control over your tools rather than cede it to unpleasant people who want to turn everything on your computer into a satellite TV subscription, with you as a disempowered consumer.\n\nUse the tools you\u2019ve settled on to do things you value: learning stuff, writing, make art, watch cat videos, and your job (optional).

{"title": "Testing the Firefox alternatives", "url": "https://tommorris.org/posts/2024/testing-the-firefox-alternatives/", "content": "Firefox and Mozilla are in a bit of a state. Firefox and Mozilla are always in a bit of a state, but the recent release of Firefox 130 which includes an AI chatbot feature has prompted a lot of head scratching.\n\nYes, I get that some people want it, and you can turn it off. And, no, that is not the issue. The issue is Mozilla are spending a lot of time and effort on chasing the sort of silly AI hype that gets Tony Blair excited. That\u2019s rather disconcerting if you\u2019d like Mozilla to focus on making a good browser instead of chasing the new and shiny because it is new and shiny.\n\n(In their defence: I\u2019ll note that some of the AI stuff Mozilla is pursing is reasonable. The translation feature uses a local model for translation, which is a great idea. It doesn\u2019t support all the languages that Google Translate does, but it\u2019s good. )\n\nAnyway, the rot just goes on. In July, it was the rollout of privacy-preserving attribution (having previously purchased Anonym). Before that, it was the rollout of the ghastly Proton UI, which necessitated (and still necessitates) setting up Lepton aka Firefox-UI-Fix. There\u2019s plenty more things people are grumpy about\u2014abandoning Servo, Solo (yet more AI hype), Pocket\u2026 there\u2019s so many things, one begins to lose track.\n\nYou can totally still stick with Firefox\u2026 but remember to download userChrome.css from GitHub. And if you want vertical tabs, be sure to install Sidebery until Mozilla get around to implementing native vertical tabs. (You know, like Chromium-based browsers including Edge and Vivaldi already have.)\n\nAnd then turn off a bunch of settings and install a bunch of extensions to tighten up privacy.\n\nAnd then brace yourself for Mozilla to find new and exciting ways to disappoint you every six weeks with some new brand of nonsensical bullshit.\n\nWhen the Privacy Preserving Ads stuff was rolled out, I pulled the trigger and switched to LibreWolf. The AI chat stuff has prompted a lot of people to look for Firefox but with less Mozilla nonsense.\n\nSwitching to what are essentially \u201cFirefox distros\u201d to collectively try and nudge Mozilla back to making more sensible decisions instead of AI hype chasing is an eminently reasonable one. There\u2019s more reasons than just that. Part of the reason I use Firefox-based browsers rather than Chromium browsers is because I want to preserve some choice and diversity in browser engines. The existence of a choice of different Firefox derived browsers may allow space for experimentation in designing better browsers. In Chromium land, Arc has shown that there\u2019s an opportunity for quite radically rethinking how browsers work. Same for Orion in Mac/iOS-land.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a detailed review of the different browsers, just a few comments and observations having tried them.\n\nLibreWolf\n\nLibreWolf has been my daily driver for a few months now. It\u2019s very close to Firefox, but with a bunch of privacy-focussed defaults.\n\nSome of these are straightforward: uBlock Origin is pre-installed, for instance. Google is not set as a default search engine\u2014DuckDuckGo, Qwant, Mojeek, and a public SearXNG instance are. HTTPS only is on by default. There\u2019s no sponsored content on the home page, and there\u2019s no telemetry.\n\nLibreWolf\u2019s commitment to good privacy defaults is simultaneously a feature and a problem. The \u201cresist fingerprinting\u201d (RFP) settings which are pulled in from the Tor Browser actively make using certain websites impossible. They trigger some kind of anti-abuse mechanisms on said websites which then require that I complete a CAPTCHA, and there is only so much of my life I wish to spend clicking squares containing fire hydrants, \u201ccrosswalks\u201d, or yellow New York taxis or various other bits of American street furniture. If it were just on crappy websites, I wouldn\u2019t mind but the main place I encounter this is actually JSTOR, along with a number of other academic/research databases. Hindering access to the few websites where the content is written by subject matter experts rather than AI-generated marketing slop is inconvenient enough that I turned RFP off via a trip to about:config .\n\nWhat I\u2019d really like is if RFP could be turned off on a per-site basis. Or if one could use the containers feature in Firefox (perhaps with Multi-Account Containers) to have RFP running on most sites, with special treatment for the websites that don\u2019t like it.\n\nSimilarly, not storing history is a great privacy choice. It\u2019s also an incredibly annoying choice for the average user who would quite like to be able to find that blog post they spent hours searching for again in their browser\u2019s history section. And, yes, you can turn it off.\n\nIf you are the sort of person who has a YubiKey, has attended a GPG key signing party, or has opinions about elliptic curve cryptography, LibreWolf may be a great fit for your tastes. If you\u2019re not, beware that security and usability are destined to have a rocky relationship\u2014and you may have to go fumbling around to disable certain security features if certain websites get aggrieved at the hardened privacy choices in LibreWolf.\n\nFloorp\n\nFloorp is a Firefox-based browser built by Ablaze, \u201ca group of creators primarily active in Japan. It is a community and not a company or a public organization\u201d (according to their FAQ).\n\nWhen you start, you can choose a \u201ctemplate\u201d. The UI doesn\u2019t really tell you what the templates are, but if you push the buttons, it\u2019ll show you.\n\nThe \u201cdefault\u201d options gives you an Vivaldi/Edge style sidebar containing icons that open up sidebar tabs for bookmarks, history and a \u2018notes\u2019 feature, plus links to documentation, Google Translate (I\u2019m home the Firefox local translation will come at some point), and passwords, settings and extensions. In addition, there\u2019s a sidebar panel called the \u201cbrowser manager\u201d which is history, downloads, tags and bookmarks rolled into one. It has a menu bar at the top. Presumably, on Windows and Linux, this is the primary way to access the menu bar, but this is probably a bug that needs fixing on the Mac version.\n\nThe \u201cbasic\u201d template disables this sidebar. The \u201cadvanced\u201d template enables a status bar that contains a \u201cfull screen\u201d button and a \u201ctake a screenshot\u201d button, and not much else, though you can obviously put stuff on there. The \u201cdefault\u201d option is fine. You can remove items from the sidebar, but annoyingly. It\u2019d be nice if you could move extension icons there, but that\u2019s a limitation of Firefox.\n\nIn addition, Floorp allows you to choose from a variety of different Firefox UI designs including both Proton and Photon/Lepton. It has built-in vertical tabs, without the fuss (but also without the features) of Sidebery. If you\u2019re intending to use vertical tabs, the Proton UI actually fits in aesthetically in both light and dark themes in a way it doesn\u2019t in Firefox.\n\nThe sensible privacy defaults of LibreWolf aren\u2019t there, so you\u2019ll probably want to install uBlock Origin, change from Google to a search engine that doesn\u2019t use text regurgitation software to advise users to \u201cenjoy the crunchy texture of glass without worrying about it contributing to weight gain\u201d, relax in a bath with a toaster and all the other stuff to turn the web from an absolute wreck into almost usable.\n\nOne feature I do like a lot in both Floorp and Zen: workspaces. These are very similar to both Arc\u2019s profiles and spaces features, and \u201ctab groups\u201d in Safari and Orion, and are handy for separating out personal and work-related tabs, or dealing with the general irritation caused by having multiple logins for different Single Sign On (another tech industry lie).\n\nDetails on the website are a bit sparse, and quite a lot of the Japanese documentation hasn\u2019t been translated into English. It\u2019s decent though, and offers lots of customisability.\n\nZen\n\nZen is relatively new. The design is clearly very inspired by Arc (rounded corners galore). Vertical tabs by default (plans are afoot to add boring old-style tabs).\n\nThere\u2019s lots to say about the layout. There\u2019s a compact mode which makes everything slide away.\n\nLike Floorp, there\u2019s a sidebar feature. Given the tab bar is a sidebar, to distinguish it from the tab bar, the settings refer to it as \u201cWeb Side Panels\u201d\u2014while the UI calls it the \u201cZen Sidebar\u201d. It\u2019s like a browser-in-a-browser. It comes preloaded with links for Wikipedia, Twitter/X, YouTube, Google Translate and Todoist. I can see the use cases for all of them: quickly looking stuff up on the side in Wikipedia, tweeting (excreting?), watching videos, translating snippets of text, and marking off items on your to-do list\u2026 but there doesn\u2019t seem to be the kind of coherence there as there is with using the sidebar to put browser features like bookmarks, history etc. I disabled the Web Side Panels/Zen Sidebar it in the settings as I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll use it.\n\nSomewhat confusingly, in Keyboard Shortcuts, I can set shortcuts to open history and bookmarks in a traditional Firefox-style sidebar. And I can open these from the View menu. In the tab sidebar, there are buttons for opening the history and bookmarks. The bookmarks button opens the bookmarks in a sidebar, while the history opens up the equivalent of the recently closed tabs section.\n\nIf you really like sidebars, you could have a sidebar with your tabs, then click \u2018bookmarks\u2019 to open a bookmarks sidebar, then have a \u201cZen Sidebar\u201d (aka a Web Side Panel). But you probably shouldn\u2019t.\n\nOne small nitpick I did find\u2014the icons for opening the bookmarks and history or sliding the tab sidebar over don\u2019t have tooltips. The settings button has a tooltip which reads \u201cOpen settings ({$shortcut})\u201d which presumably should contain a keyboard shortcut.\n\nOn macOS, another weird part\u2014if you use a tab sidebar, the red/yellow/green buttons are no longer in the corner\u2014they\u2019re immediately above the content area. This looks a bit odd. It\u2019s probably remediable by having the tab bar on the right\u2026 but the checkbox to move it to the right doesn\u2019t work for me. You can fix it by switching on \u201cUse legacy toolbar position\u201d, or by enabling the title bar in the toolbar customisation menu.\n\nOne other slight annoyance: when I tried to log on to a site supporting Passkeys, it stated \u201cThis browser or device is reporting partial passkey support.\u201d\n\nThe above complaints may sound like I dislike Zen\u2014I very much don\u2019t. It\u2019s described as \u201calpha\u201d on their website and release notes, and it\u2019s remarkably good given the first alpha release came out less than two months ago, so this kind of UI nitpicks will almost certainly go away given how much progress they\u2019re making in a very short time.\n\nThey\u2019ve made a theme store to collect themes specifically for Zen, which is helpful given the significant distance it has travelled from stock Firefox in terms of UI design.\n\nLike Floorp, there\u2019s workspaces, which are very handy and integrate with containers. Also like Floop (but unlike LibreWolf out-of-the-box), you can use Firefox Sync.\n\nThe default search engine is DuckDuckGo, which is an improvement on Google. There\u2019s also Google, (English) Wikipedia and eBay.\n\nAgain, the privacy defaults are pretty much like Firefox\u2019s, so you\u2019ll want to install uBlock Origin and any other privacy-related add-ons that you would in Firefox.\n\nOnwards\n\nThere are a bunch of other Firefox-derived browsers like Waterfox, Pale Moon, Basilisk, IceCat. I haven\u2019t tried them, and don\u2019t know much about them.\n\nOne important thing to keep an eye on how quickly security fixes get pushed through from upstream Firefox to Firefox-derived browsers. For a long time, I stuck with Firefox precisely because of this. It\u2019s a sign of how bad the rot has got at Mozilla that people are so keen on alternatives. I really hope Mozilla might learn something from this, but history suggests they\u2019ll try literally anything else first, and the love-hate relationship will never end.", "label": "personal"}

{"title": "Keeping current in infosec", "url": "https://shellsharks.com/notes/2023/11/06/keeping-current-in-infosec", "content": "Mike Sass\n\n@shellsharks\n\nI do a lot of reading related to my infosec career, whether it be in-depth reading/research/analysis or just briefly skimming articles/social media posts. For what I do, staying on top of what is happening in the industry is very important. Couple that with an admittedly debilitating mild social media / phone addiction and you get a very routine course of daily reading. Below I will explain my daily routine for keeping up with cybersecurity news, research and more!\n\nDaily Infosec Reading Routine\n\nComplete Checks\n\nThe items below represent feeds I fully check daily, and in many cases, multiple-times/throughout-the day. I\u2019ve also listed them in the order I typically check them.\n\nThings I Check Sparingly\n\nBelow I\u2019ve listed feeds/platforms I check either as overflow from my primary reading or only once-in-a-while, either because the signal-to-noise ratio isn\u2019t great or the feed is algorithmic, i.e. no way to \u201cread all of it\u201d.\n\nThreads : Threads is a lively place but the infosec content there is very limited at this time.\n\n: Threads is a lively place but the infosec content there is very limited at this time.

BlueSky : A small infosec contingent here but nothing compared to Mastodon.\n\n: A small infosec contingent here but nothing compared to Mastodon. Discord: There are a lot of infosec-related servers, but looking through all the different servers and their respective channels for interesting discussions/links is too time-consuming of a task. I don\u2019t even have enough time most days to look at the Shellsharks Discord server.\n\nPodcasts\n\nThough not technically \u201creading\u201d, I also have a couple infosec-related podcasts I tune in to when new episodes become available.\n\nWhen I find interesting articles, I save them to my read-it-later service (which is currently Pocket - though I plan on migrating to something else soon). When I have time, I go back into my saved items and open articles to peruse/digest.\n\nIn addition to browsing and reading articles, I also find time to share interesting articles out (via Mastodon, Threads, Discord or Lemmy) and have discussions about them if/when people engage.\n\nI will admit I am probably on the more extreme end of \u201ckeeping up with\u201d security news/trends and you certainly don\u2019t need to go to these lengths to stay fresh. But now you know what I do so feel free to copy some or all of it and get out there and learn!", "label": "personal"}

Made a ton of changes to the site. The home page now features a mixed feed of all of my posts, notes, logs and other content types. I\u2019ve also started a link blog to share cool links I come across. Finally, I\u2019ve figured out how to paginate a TON of stuff, to make some of my pages more performant (my Activity page is one good example of how pagination is making that page usable on mobile now).\n\nWith respect to my home page, I used to be kinda precious about only exposing my formal \u201cblog posts\u201d, which are supposed to be longer-form, and in some undefinable way, \u201cbetter\u201d than other things I write and publish on the site. Inspired by others in the Indieweb community, who proudly feature everything they write, I decided to try out the same. To distinguish between different content types, i\u2019ve added a splash of color with icons corresponding to different post types. I also hope it can call attention (for those who are interested) to all the other things I publish. For so long, I had these hidden away in pages you could find via my \u201chamburger\u201d menu, but you had to go exploring to really find most of it. And given the number of things I link to in that menu, I doubt many people had the patience or interest to really hunt down other things. So, here we are!\n\nLet me know what ya think! I\u2019m still tinkering around with the format, theme and other general aesthetics of the site and various pages, but I like it well enough at this point.", "label": "personal"}

{"title": "5 years", "url": "https://shellsharks.com/notes/2024/05/30/5-years", "content": "Mike Sass\n\n@shellsharks\n\nOn May 30, 2019 I published the very first post to shellsharks.com, \u201cGetting Into Information Security\u201d. When I first started the blog I didn\u2019t have a particularly clear idea of what I wanted to do with it, but I had the idea to write that piece and one other idea which which was to catalog all named vulnerabilities. Beyond that, I just wrote about whatever came to mind. It\u2019s been 5 years to the day since I got that first piece out and not only has the site come a long way, but so have I.\n\nIn the beginning, I think my main focus was to keep the site mostly infosec-related in terms of my writing, but even back then I left the door open to write about other things. Afterall, the tagline for my site has always been \u201cInfosec, Technology, Life\u201d. The first 4 years of the site did end up skewing mostly Infosec / Tech but since discovering the IndieWeb last year, I have made a noticeable shift towards writing more about \u201cLife\u201d, i.e. anything non-tech / non-infosec, and it\u2019s been a lot of fun!\n\nThe site has also gone through a number of big aesthetic overhauls and architectural redesigns. There will always be new things I want to add to the site or ways in which I wish I could rearchitect it even further, but for now, I am quite happy with the latest generation of its look-and-feel as well as the functionality itself.\n\nI\u2019ve not maintained the same level of active-ness throughout the last 5 years, but in more recent history I\u2019m quite pleased with the amount of attention I\u2019ve given it, the upgrades I\u2019ve made, and the writing I\u2019ve produced, and I am certainly starting the next 5 years quite strong. I plan to continue to funnel my professional work, technological side quests and life experiences into what I write about.\n\nI really want to thank everyone who has read anything I\u2019ve written, those who have offered kind words over social media or elsewhere, those who have given me meaningful/constructive feedback and anyone who has taken the time to subscribe, like or engage with me or my writing. Like many who start a blog, I had no expectation of building a readership. I started it with the intention of sharing my oft-repeated guidance on getting into the infosec field and as a place to write resources for myself. Over time though I have found that sure enough, there are people out there who enjoy, or get value out of what I have documented or what I have to say and it is undoubtedly a good feeling.\n\nThese days, I spend as much if not more effort writing about and encouraging others to start a site and be themselves as I do writing about tech/infosec. My experience with shellsharks has taught me more about what it means to be authentic on the web than it has helped me with my various infosec-related research things. I\u2019m still a cybersecurity professional and as such will continue to make that a focus of what I learn and thus what I write about, but it is clear to me that I\u2019ve developed a passion for IndieWeb advocacy and I hope to continue to inspire others both in my field and abroad to start their own journey in the personal web.\n\nThanks for reading.

Drop me a note, or comment at the end, if you participate and I will add a link at the bottom of this page. Use the tag #Pointless10 if you're on the socials.\n\nDo you floss your teeth? No! Pointless. A good brush is enough. Tea, coffee, or water? Between the three, water - preferable still and ice-cold. I dabble in tea -- maybe one cup every other day. I've never had a coffee. I know, I'm odd. Did anyone ask about wine? ;-) Bare feet as much as possible, around the house mostly. Outdoors, generally a canvas shoe (Sketchers) . I don't have any sneakers. Favourite dessert? Lime Cheesecake. Not the American baked kind, but the set one. The first thing you do when you wake up? Check my phone (don't we all) then shower. Age you'd like to stick to? 26 seems a good age to be for body health, but I want to retain all the wisdom I've gained at 55. How many hats do you own? Three. All brimmed style hats, no caps. I love wearing a hat but don't do it enough. Describe the last photo you took A bottle of red wine I tried at a friend's house; didn't want to forget what it was. Worst TV show Any soap opera. Although they are a work of fiction, people seem to believe that's how we should live real life... As rude, disrespectful, argumentative twats. As a child, what was your aspiration for adulthood? To become a vet. Didn't happen.

{"title": "Travel Adventures", "url": "https://shellsharks.com/blog-challenge-travel-adventures", "content": "A Blog Questions Challenge\n\nHere\u2019s another Blog Questions Challenge. This week, it\u2019s all about Travel Adventures!\n\nHere are the questions\u2026\n\nSilliest Souvenir\n\nIn 2014 me and my wife went to Costa Rica. We did a lot of travel-by-bus to various excusions and destinations across the country. During those bus rides, I (for whatever reason) witnessed an unusual amount of machete-based chopping of vegetation and general plant-related growth on the sides of the rural roads we traveled down. Now this might not be unusual for Costa Rica, but it was for me as a tourist. So naturally, I wanted to get a machete as a souvenir. At the time of purchasing it, I never considered what it would look like, trying to get a huge machete back through customs at the airport\u2026\n\nState-side, we got to security and that\u2019s when I remembered my cargo. Sure enough, going through security I was asked to come with them to a back room as they had some questions for me. I thought for sure it was because of the machete. But nope! They were interested in a different souvenir of mine. We had also purchased a \u201crain stick\u201d, which is effectively just a hollow wooden tube filled with small beads. They were really curious (and slightly concerend) about what all those little beads were inside the stick. After a brief explanation though they were satisfied and I was on my way once more. Not even a single mention of the machete. Hah!\n\nTeleport for a Day Trip\n\nThat\u2019s me in Bora Bora circa 2016. There\u2019s a very non-zero chance that I was thinking about climbing that mountain in this exact moment (in addition to just posing for a super-cool sunset pic). If I could teleport to one place for a day to do something, it wound be here, to hike Bora Bora\u2019s Mount Otemanu. Afterwards, I\u2019d just chill on the beach with a nice beverage and watch the sun set, much like I did in 2016. \ud83c\udfdd\ufe0f \ud83c\udf05\n\nWeirdest Food\n\nIn 2013, I went on my first international trip ever. So where does one go on their first trip out of the country? Africa of course! Me and my wife went to South Africa\u2014first to Cape Town and then to Kruger National Park for some safari-ing. To this day (and I\u2019ve done a fair bit of travel since), I would still say it\u2019s my favorite trip I\u2019ve ever done. One night, while dining out in the city-center of Cape Town, we ordered what I remember as some sort of \u201cexotic meat sampler\u201d. On the resulting plate, we tried a number of interesting South African-native game including Kudu, Crocodile, Springbok and if I\u2019m remembering fully, Zebra. All I really remember about that experience beyond what I tried was that Kudu was delicious, and I was not into the croc.\n\nMemorable Wrong Turn\n\nLook, my wife is the (trip) planner of the two of us, and she is amazing at it. What this means is that our trips are always fantastic, we get into a TON of fun activities, and we rarely encounter anything you might consider a \u201cwrong turn\u201d. That said, this particlar question made me think of two distinct wrong-turn-esque events\u2026\n\nOnce, while driving somewhere in Germany we witnessed this little car in front of us try to make too sharp of a turn on a highway on-ramp and completely spin out\u2014like a 360\u00b0 spin. It was wild, and quite scary to witness. A \u201cwrong turn\u201d for that individual to say the least.\n\nThe most memorable \u201cwrong turn\u201d for me however occurred when me and my wife were trying to drive back from the national park in Sintra, Portugal to where we were staying in Lisbon. We exited the park into what I imagine was the old-town part of Sintra and ended up on some very tiny streets with extremely narrow passage ways between the buildings and walls of the town. At one point, my wife had to get out of the car and help me narrowly traverse one particularly tight corridor. Our rental was a pretty small car too. Luckily, we made it out without a scratch, literally!\n\nThanks for reading!", "label": "personal"}
{"title": "Things I Wish I Knew Before I Made My Website", "url": "https://shellsharks.com/blog-things-i-wish-i-had-known", "content": "Here\u2019s a list of things I wish I had known before I set out on my blogging / site-making / IndieWeb journey. (In no particular order)\n\n\n\nHad I known these, and carefully considered each, I would have saved myself A LOT of time fixing stuff, and even now, would have a lot less things to fix and add. For example, my CSS files are a mess, I have a lot of poorly managed inline .JS everywhere, accessiblity nightmares abound and much more\u2026 Learn from my mistakes!\n\nUnderstand and properly leverage Semantic HTML Elements. This approach will help your code be more readable, more modular and more descriptive.\n\nBe purposeful and methodical with your CSS \u201ccode\u201d. Try to define common sense CSS and make it reusable. To the best of your ability, try to avoid overusing inline CSS. It will make things harder to troubleshoot and more annoying to maintain over time. Take the time to understand dynamic HTMl stuff for different screen-sized devices, etc\u2026 You\u2019re going to want your site to look good on desktops and phones, simple as that.\n\nUse JavaScript sparingly, try to design your site to work well-enough for those who completely disable JavaScript. Look, my site has plenty of JS, and I know certain things would completely break if it were disabled (looking at you hamburger menu). That\u2019s really too bad for folks who want to use my site. I\u2019d like to fix this, but just haven\u2019t had time to figure it out. Also consider The JavaScript Trap. JS not only has incompatibility issues, but can also just slow down your site and introduce potential security vulns. Important things to consider!\n\nDon\u2019t box yourself in creatively\u2014 REALLY! Allow yourself to write about whatever you want. Use things like collections, different post types or tags to logically differentiate things you think are meant for different audiences if you must.\n\nVersion one of your site should have a theme toggle (i.e. dark/light mode) and a search function. You\u2019re going to want these eventually, and it\u2019s worth getting them right in the initial design if you ask me.\n\nBuild accessibility in from the get-go. I\u2019ve put very little effort into this, and that sucks. One of my Guiding Principles for this site is that it is available to be consumed by all. Yet, if I\u2019ve not made it adequately accessible, it will never meet this mantra. It\u2019s not necessarily hard to do, but if you don\u2019t consider it from t=0, it becomes harder and more time-consuming to retroactively make it so.\n\nWrite for yourself, not for some perceived \u201caudience\u201d. Don\u2019t try to be a persona (i.e. some \u201cprofessional\u201d fragment of your true self)\u2014just be yourself.\n\nDo some basic website wireframing as part of your initial size build. Carefully consider what you want your home page to look like, how you want people to navigate about, what you want your posts to look like, etc\u2026\n\nHow \u201csocial\u201d do you want your site to be? In the age of the social web, there is a lot you can add or implement to make your site interoperate with ActivityPub, IndieWeb protocols, comment systems, etc\u2026", "label": "personal"}

It\u2019s delicious! I normally take 2/3 of a pint glass with a splash of half-n-half, another splash of 2% milk, then top it off with ice (cubes). This is what I drink most of the time these days. Since I\u2019m newish to brewing my own cold brew, I\u2019m still exploring what types of beans I like most and have really been enjoying sampling different roasts and regions (speaking of, maybe I should start a sort of \u201ccoffeelog\u201d where I can do some tasting notes / reviews\u2026 \ud83e\udd14). Not sure what I like the most yet, but I do know that it\u2019s far better than the french press swill I had been making before.\n\nWhen I\u2019m out \u2018n about and ordering coffee, I typically go with an iced latte or sometimes just an iced coffee. I like getting the latte\u2019s because I can\u2019t make them at home. I never drink hot coffee. I\u2019d rather have no coffee than have it hot. I just don\u2019t enjoy hot beverages. When I do happen across a Starbucks, my go-to order is their Iced Brown Sugar Oatmilk Shaken Espresso, with just 1 pump of the syrup, otherwise it\u2019s too sweet for my liking.\n\nCheers!", "label": "personal"}
