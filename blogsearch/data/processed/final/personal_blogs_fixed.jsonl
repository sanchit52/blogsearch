Camels have pretty silly (and grumpy) personalities as it is, but the Bactrian variety have wildly ridiculous camel humps. I got up close and personal with some at a wild live reserve kinda\u2019 thing once.\n\nPlant Superpower\n\nHonestly I did some web searching to find cool \u201cabilities\u201d I would want to steal from a plant and came up kinda empty. Fire resistance, regeneration, growing super tall\u2014these are all things that are kinda cool, but nothing specific stood out to me. So, as my pick, I\u2019ve decided to go with the wise old Oak Tree. For any particular ability? Not really. I just like the idea of being a chill old Oak Tree that animals love to hang out with.\n\nFavorite Nature Sound\n\nI\u2019d say it\u2019s a close tie between the sound of a mountain stream and that of a rain storm with low, rolling thunder.\n\nThe Perfect Nature Spot\n\nEasy. Western-facing, mountain-side cabin. Conifers as far as the eye can see. A mountain creek babbles nearby. The glow of a camp fire flickers across my face as I watch the sun melt behind the distant peaks.\n\nThanks for reading!", "label": "non_personal"}
{"title": "One of us", "url": "https://shellsharks.com/notes/2024/05/14/one-of-us", "content": "Mike Sass\n\n@shellsharks\n\nI recently came across this post where the author laments that the IndieWeb is \u201cnot for them\u201d, simply because of their inability to implement Webmentions and thus (as they put it) the \u201cIndieWeb is a social club for developers\u201d only. (See also this one with respect to not feeling part of the \u201ccommunity\u201d.)\n\nLet me be extremely clear. You do not need Webmentions to be part of the \u201cIndieWeb\u201d. The only real \u201crequirement\u201d, if you want to think of it that way, is to just have your own site on your own domain where you put your own stuff. That\u2019s it. How you make it look, what you put on there, what fancy IndieWeb.org \u201cbuilding blocks\u201d you decide to implement, doesn\u2019t make your site any more or less \u201cIndieWeb\u201d than any other.\n\nIndieweb.org is a great resource. But I fear that for as much good as it does, it can do equal harm. On the surface, Indieweb.org has a fantastic message.\n\nWhat is the IndieWeb? The IndieWeb is a people-focused alternative to the \u201ccorporate web\u201d. It is a community of independent and personal websites connected by open standards and based on the principles of: owning your domain and using it as your primary online identity, publishing > on your own site first (optionally elsewhere), and owning your content. Your content is yours When you post something on the web, it should belong to you, not a corporation. Too many companies have gone out of business and lost all of their users\u2019 data. By joining the IndieWeb, your content stays yours and in your control. You are better connected Your articles and status messages can be distributed to any platform, not just one, allowing you to engage with everyone. Replies and likes on other services can come back to your site so they\u2019re all in one place. You are in control You can post anything you want, in any format you want, with no one monitoring you. In addition, you share simple readable links such as example.com/ideas. These links are permanent and will always work.\n\nThe message is simple. The IndieWeb is about people. It\u2019s about owning your own domain and putting your stuff there. Great! But just below the surface, as you start to click on some of the links, IndieWeb.org begins to preach complexity. IndieAuth, Webmention, Micropub, WebSub, Microsub, building blocks, microformats, backfeeds, etc\u2026 These convolutions are niche, techno-aristocratic IndieWeb fever dreams which discourage and alienate those desperate to break from corporate web-silos and start anew on a simpler, more human web. Ignore them.\n\nA note on \u201ccommunity\u201d\u2026\n\nIf you are reading this, or you have a personal site, you are already part of it. Full stop. You don\u2019t need to be shy. You have things to say and people WANT to listen, they want to read, they want to connect. You don\u2019t have to be an \u201cinfluencer\u201d or have a big following. Your writing doesn\u2019t need to be AMAZING. You don\u2019t need to write to an audience. Write for yourself. Then share it. People will be interested I promise you. The #indieweb revival is here and you are 100% invited! Tell your friends.\n\nSo, hopefully this message can make it out to those who need to hear it\u2026\n\nYou want to be part of the IndieWeb? Be one of us? Get a domain. Put your site on it. Be yourself. Because the IndieWeb is about you.", "label": "non_personal"}

You can always start real simple and get more complex as you go. Time may be the biggest hurdle. I would just say that a blog isn\u2019t something you need to maintain or publish regularly.

{"title": "The adolescents are alright. So are the common people. Let\u2019s make tech good for them.", "url": "https://tommorris.org/posts/2025/the-adolescents-are-alright-so-are-the-common-people-lets-make-tech-good-for-them/", "content": "I\u2019ve been trying and failing to write about the current vibes of technology for the last few months, with a specific focus on both the wrapping up of the Post Office Horizon Inquiry, and the threat/promise by Keir Starmer to \u201cmainline AI in the veins\u201d of the United Kingdom. But that\u2019s way too big. I want to talk about aforementioned vibes based on two recent fictional depictions that directly touch on the societal role of technology. And because we\u2019re talking about vibes, I need to give two warnings. One is that it\u2019s just my opinion, man, and it will meander around a bit.\n\nAnd the second is a spoiler warning for both Adolescence and Black Mirror Series 7 Episode 1 (\u2018Common People\u2019).\n\nTo say Adolescence has become a touch point for popular concern about technology in the UK is an understatement. Each episode is a technically flawless one shot. The mini-series starts with a dramatic early morning arrest of a thirteen year old boy for murder of a classmate. The camera then follows the plodding institutional procedure of Jamie being booked into a police custody suite, having his fingerprints and samples taken, then an interview. It should be noted that the apparent commitment to procedural accuracy gets a bit shaky when it comes to the role of the defence solicitor, but given the number of disclosure violations in the criminal justice system of England and Wales, a few more occurring in fiction is at least in keeping with the show\u2019s commitment to brutal realism.\n\nThe subsequent episodes apply the same masterful theatre-like technique to the investigation of the crime by detectives at the unpleasant secondary school where both perpetrator and victim studied, then to a pre-trial interview by a psychologist in a youth detention centre, and finally to the consequences of the conviction on Jamie\u2019s family.\n\nGiven the centrality of technology to the crime at the heart of both the drama and the societal discussion it has spawned, it is weirdly absent from the masterly manoeuvred view of the camera. It reminds me of the depiction of HIV/AIDS on screen\u2014it is always there in the sense that it shapes the lives of those it affects, but you never see it, only the wretched physical effects it has on people infected, and the emotional consequences for their partners, friends and communities. Here, the smartphone, or the gaming console or PC, is the unseen horror, a malevolent ghost that is everywhere and nowhere. The inciting incident for the murder\u2014a series of interactions on Instagram\u2014are never seen, only discussed by others. The key to interpreting them is only grasped indirectly, when the detective\u2019s son Adam takes pity and gives his father a remedial education in translating semantically-overloaded emojis from impenetrable zoomer lingo into a motive that explains murder.\n\nThe Prime Minister incorrectly referring to Adolescence in Parliament as a \u201cdocumentary\u201d is perhaps a testament to the artful camerawork, but it is practically being treated as one\u2014with efforts to add it to the National Curriculum and legislate based on the assumption that screen time is not just rotting the brains of the young, it is turning them into murderers. Something. Must. Be. Done. Ban smartphones from the schools. Oh, what, headteachers can already do that? Well, double triple quadruple ban them! And ban the kids from social media too. Maybe we could pass some kind of Online Safety Bill to\u2026 oh, wait, we already have.\n\nLet\u2019s start with some concessions. There are bad consequences of technology. Obviously. But the nuance-free debate we\u2019ve seen since seems predicated on the idea that there is this giant immutable thing called Technology, and we can\u2019t do much about it. The most we can do is to save the Jamies and Lisas from the Satanic evils of Snapchat, Instagram and TikTok until they\u2019re old enough to make their own decisions. And once we\u2019ve returned to the pre-iPhone norm, order will be restored and childhood saved.\n\nThe framing around the government\u2019s AI policy is also worth noting here. The pressing need to \u201cmainline\u201d it into our national veins is roughly \u201cthis seems like it is inevitable, we at least want it to make some money and create some jobs\u201d, combined with a little dash of \u201cwe don\u2019t know what it is, but whatever it is, we want to beat China at it\u201d. The train is rolling, we either get on board and reap some economic and geostrategic benefits, or we don\u2019t. And we\u2019d rather reap some benefits than be stuck in the past, right? Stop with all the nuance. Get on board or die. (Silicon Valley accelerationism is basically a version of this view, but with a penchant for skull measuring, and an addiction to ketamine.)\n\nBoth the post-Adolescence moralism and the boosterish \u201cmainline AI into our veins\u201d narrative seem to coexist in the political imagination of Sir Keir Starmer, and both depend on a feeling that the result is inevitable and foreordained, and all we can do is react. We either accept it, and hope we can nudge it gently towards some social benefit, or bring down the regulatory banhammer.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable why people don\u2019t feel much control over technology. It\u2019s a fact they don\u2019t have much control. That\u2019s a problem we need to fix. The solution to that is imagining an alternative where they do. Let\u2019s imagine if technology was a tool that individuals could shape in accordance with their goals for a better life.\n\nA nuanced discussion of technology that doesn\u2019t fall into inevitabilism and moral panic might help us understand technology in a way where we can respond to it in intelligent and effective ways.\n\nAs an illustration, let\u2019s talk about Roblox. I have friends with young children who spend hours and hours every day playing Roblox on an iPad. When discussing Roblox, their chief concerns are \u201care they spending too much time on this thing?\u201d and \u201care they gonna end up talking to predators?\u201d\n\nThe easy answers you\u2019ll generally hear from the media: yes and yes.\n\nThe real answers to this are: that depends on a whole load of other variables and perhaps, but that risk very hard to quantify.\n\nAre there sexual predators on Roblox? Yes. This is because Roblox is a service on the internet, and there are sexual predators on the internet, in much the same way there are sexual and other predators everywhere. Are Roblox doing enough to combat predators on their platform? Maybe. Hard to tell. We may get more information as the new regulatory regime in the Online Safety Act takes shape, along with similar regulatory regimes in EU and Australia. Or we might not. But, absolutely, be vigilant against awful people, and don\u2019t assume the company will give a damn unless it reaches a point where it affects their stock price.\n\nAre children spending too much time on Roblox? Depends on the child, what they\u2019re getting from using the service, and what the opportunity cost there is. A lot of children and young people spend a lot of time playing computer games. So do adults. I\u2019ve spent a fair amount of time playing games. Some of them were crap, some of them were amazing. Kinda like books or albums or movies or meals in restaurants. Some of the people I knew at school likely spent time hanging around rural bus stations drinking bottles of White Lightning, a substance that\u2019s only charitably referred to as cider. Others took violin lessons and went to Oxford. (You can adjudicate which ones turned out happier and better adjusted.)\n\nSome of the kids I knew at school would have had colossally high levels of what is now called \u201cscreen time\u201d. Many also had colossally high levels of bullying. If you take the view that the time wandering around Roblox or watching weird algorithmically generated YouTube kids videos is time that said kids aren\u2019t spending playing with friends in wholesome ways, or taking ballet classes or composing sonnets, then, yes, your utilitarian calculus will swing heavily against it. But then you also need to weigh up the kids who are learning to build their own websites or video games, or finding supportive communities, or reading, or playing videos games with really strong narratives. And you need to add all the stuff in the plus column against all the absolutely bloody silly things kids got up to that did not need involve screens or internet connections. \u201cScreen time\u201d is a number, not an evaluation of whether the time spent was worthwhile in the context of their life.\n\nInto those conversations with parent friends about Roblox come the concessions: yes, it might be a waste of time. Yes, there might be Bad People on there, do keep an eye out for that. But, please, keep listening, it\u2019s also way worse than that. The whole enterprise of things like Roblox are built on pester power. Roblox makes absolute bank out of users convincing their parents to buy Robux to spend on random stuff in Roblox. That\u2019s how Roblox is very, very rich.\n\nLoads of other games do likewise too. Finding the games that don\u2019t suck is hard because our rating systems are based on a perception of risk that is centred around violence, profanity and nudity/sexual content. This is understandable: the video game rating system was basically cut and paste from the rating system used for films and television. But it isn\u2019t actually helpful to think about them in the same way as you do for film and television.\n\nAn illustration of this: Elden Ring is rated 16+ by PEGI, because it contains violence and gore and some nudity, apparently. (I haven\u2019t played it. I hear it is very good.) EA Sports FC \u201925 (formerly known as FIFA) is rated 3+ because it doesn\u2019t contain any violence or gore or nudity\u2014it\u2019s a football game, after all. It has an in-game currency, which is used to purchase randomised card packs. These are ways you give the game developer money in order to have a random chance to win something of benefit to you in the game\u2014namely, players. (So I\u2019m told. I also haven\u2019t played it.) If you don\u2019t win, you can pay lots of money to keep buying more and more card packs and opening them on the off-chance of getting the prize you want. That may sound like the sort of thing gambling addicts do with a fixed odds betting terminal. But you\u2019ll be glad to know it is not within the scope of the Gambling Act 2005 because that requires it be done \u201cfor a prize\u201d. A prize is defined as \u201cmoney or money\u2019s worth\u201d. And cards that give you the ability to add football players to your team aren\u2019t that. Other jurisdictions disagree, specifically Netherlands and Belgium.\n\nSure, there have always been ways for kids to waste their pocket money, from Panini stickers to Pogs to Pokemon cards. You used to have to slog your way down to your newsagent to waste your money on Panini football stickers. Now, PEGI, the Pan European Game Information service, who rate video games in the UK and Europe have decided that a game that pummels you with both the aesthetics of, and the mechanics of, gambling in order to win the chance of signing better players for your virtual football team deserves a 3+ \u201cSuitable for all ages\u201d ranking, with a little notice that reads:\n\nThis game offers players the opportunity to purchase in-game items, in the form of an in-game currency, which can be used to purchase random card packs and other game items. Some parents or carers may want to be aware of this. Parents, carers or other responsible adults should check to see what is being offered before making any purchase on behalf of a child. It should be noted that the game can still be played without the need to purchase such items.\n\nWhat is omitted from this description is that the game will usually really suck if you don\u2019t purchase said items, so you\u2019ll be constantly pressured to do so over and over.\n\nAnother example: let\u2019s talk about Balatro. It\u2019s an indie card-based computer game, and it is incredibly addictive. It is not a gambling game but it does rely on the scoring rules of poker hands. When PEGI first rated the game last year, they gave it an 18+ rating as it contained \u201cprominent gambling imagery\u201d. This is enough to classify it as 18+. EA Sports FC, which tries to get players to play what\u2019s essentially an I Can\u2019t Believe It\u2019s Not Gambling! slot machine to build their football team, is rated 3+. Balatro was reclassified on appeal as 10+, perhaps so PEGI could still retain some shred of professional dignity. Presumably, PEGI are still committed to the idea that EA Sports FC card packs are suitable for 3-9 year olds in a way that cartoon depictions of playing cards aren\u2019t.\n\nIt has now taken me boatloads of paragraphs to explain what sucks about lots of modern video games from AAA studios in a way someone who doesn\u2019t play video games can understand, and to give you examples of how the rating system designed by the industry and approved by regulators to protect children from harm does not actually do this very well. Humans are busy people and don\u2019t want to have to think about this. By contrast, \u201ctoo much screen time bad\u201d fits in a tweet or an opinion column. Guess which one takes off more in the public consciousness. And if you\u2019re a government, banning stuff costs nothing. (Except if you do it really badly. Which we have. More on that later. Let\u2019s get back to the really important stuff, namely television.)\n\nIf the technology in Adolescence takes the form of ghoulish off-screen actions that requires a secret Gen-Z emoji-to-English decoder ring to understand, the technology in \u2018Common People\u2019, the first episode of the new series of Black Mirror is as clear as day.\n\nAmanda is a teacher, and her British partner Mike is working in manual labour in Smalltown, USA. While in front of her class, Amanda collapses into a coma and suffers brain damage. There is no hope, says the doctor, except an experimental neurotech startup called Rivermind. In walks a kind saleswoman for the company. Installing the device would be free. The affected bit of the brain would be backed up to the cloud, and restored to the McGuffin every night while you sleep. The catch? it would be $300/month to pay for the subscription service. When the alternative is being dead, $300 is a bargain! OpenAI want $200 a month for the super duper version of ChatGPT after all.\n\nThe satire goes exactly where anyone who understands the arc of consumer tech would guess from the premise. Mike takes on extra shifts to help pay for the service keeping his partner alive, and ends up hustling for money on a website that\u2019s basically Twitch for sadistic humiliation. A premium tier is rolled out, and the basic tier is rapidly enshittified (technical term, don\u2019t blame me). Contextual adverts spew from Amanda\u2019s mouth at inopportune times (without her even being aware), which leads to her being almost fired after an advert for a shady Christian counselling service is unknowingly spewed directly at a pupil needing her support. Her \u201crest mode\u201d gets further extended, and her brain starts being used for some unstated purpose to benefit the Rivermind corporation, rather like a piece of malware mining cryptocurrency for someone else\u2019s benefit, except it\u2019s living in your own brain. (That\u2019s some real body horror.)\n\nI won\u2019t spoil the ending. It\u2019s as grim as you expect from Black Mirror.\n\nYes, it\u2019s Black Mirror, it\u2019s going to be over the top. Except, of course, the satire is real. People with \u201cobsolete\u201d bionic eyes that are no longer supported by the manufacturer are now losing their sight because\u2026 well, I\u2019d love for someone to justify this, because I sure as hell can\u2019t. There was once a time when restoring someone\u2019s sight got people to start spreading rumours about you being the messiah and fulfilling the prophecies foretold in the Book of Isaiah. Well, great news, we achieved a similar feat using technology. Then we cancelled the miracle that\u2019s sitting inside the eyelids of actual human beings when it conflicted with corporate intellectual property rights, and now they will go blind again.\n\nEvery time I think about the notion of the discontinued bionic eyes losing sight, I want to punch a wall. It\u2019s just so incredibly awful and in direct opposition to any humane version of how I envision technology working in society. We have the tech. It works. \u201cAI will fix it?\u201d Fuck right off, we\u2019ve already fixed it. And yet we haven\u2019t because of this? Absolutely ghoulish.\n\nThis episode of Black Mirror is not really about tech. Unlike some vibe-coded fantasy by a founder who doesn\u2019t want to pay software developers (or indeed, large chunks of what passes for enterprise software), the tech here actually does work. The culture around it doesn\u2019t. If you wanted to imagine a world where people have to engage in public displays of self-degradation on social media in order to pay for essential healthcare costs, well, type \u201cinsulin GoFundMe\u201d into a search engine. Researchers have written papers on the phenomena.\n\nThe McGuffin in this episode doesn\u2019t need fixing. The laws do. If someone sells you what the tech industry incorrectly refers to as a \u201cproduct\u201d, then fundamentally changes the terms in this manner\u2026 that ought to be an actionable consumer rights issue. Yes, even if in teeny tiny print on page 87 of the contract it says they can do that. But rebalancing consumer rights in an age of enshittified software-as-a-service is boring, involves tradeoffs, and might cost money. Take Smartphones Off Teenagers is super easy in comparison.\n\nThe point here is technology is not a magic box brought down from on high, it is a thing we create, and we collectively can decide how to regulate and shape it. We can just accept some Adolescence-style moral panic about ghostly black rectangles, decide we have no agency to meaningfully morph it to further the goals we want. We could do something, anything, because please won\u2019t someone think of the children. Or we could engage with it in a sensible but extremely critical way. If you want to be extremely critical, you\u2019ve got to understand it first.\n\nTechnologists\u2014the people who create, design and develop the technology\u2014are incredibly critical of technology.\n\nA little sample. Blockchain nonsense: absolutely crap, pretty much just scams. AI: yeah, in small, very well-tested domains it can be useful, but there\u2019s so much hype and nonsense, most of it pushed by politicians and business executives. Data security: Jesus, we\u2019re about a decade behind where we need to be. Those printers that want a subscription fee: yeah, throw that in the garbage and buy whatever the least awful laser printer is this year and use it until it dies.\n\nI frequently find myself explaining that there are viable alternatives to the exploitative treadmill of software-as-a-service subscription-based spyware. And yes, the barely functional AI nonsense they\u2019ve crowbarred into Office, Windows, iOS or WhatsApp is not there for your benefit. It is there because there\u2019s an AI investment bubble, and investors need to be convinced that Microsoft, Apple, Meta et al. have jumped on the hype train, even if it isn\u2019t actually going anywhere worth going.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to Roblox a second. Yes, yes, child predators, pester power, wait, virtual concentration camps. Oh god, do we have to?\n\nWhat does Roblox do right? It gives kids tools to make games. Wait, they don\u2019t call them games, they call them \u201cexperiences\u201d, probably because of App Store review rules or whatever. But you can make game-like things and share them with your friends. That\u2019s really cool.\n\nWe have a creation tool here that allows children to creatively use it to express themselves. That\u2019s good at least. Ah, but, I\u2019m sorry, there\u2019s bad stuff when you look a bit harder. Not the murdering-your-classmates genre of bad, but the boring nerdy regulatory kind of bad.\n\nIf you make a game on Roblox, the nice people at the Roblox Corporation pay you money if you do well in the form of Robux, which you can use to buy other stuff on Robux. When kids pester their parents to buy them Robux, the current exchange rate is \u00a34.99 for 500 Robux. You can buy them at a discount if you buy lots of them. The official exchange rate is 1 Robux = $0.0125 (\u00a30.009572 at time of writing).\n\nIf you accumulate lots of Robux because you\u2019ve made a successful \u201cexperience\u201d (i.e. game), you can cash out through a process called Developer Exchange, or DevEx. You can only do this when you\u2019ve earned 30,000 Robux. Great, so you get $375, right? Wrong! That\u2019s the rate at which you buy Robux. When you cash them out, you only get $0.0035 per Robux. Your 30,000 Robux turns into $105. You want to ask careful critical questions about technology? \u201cHow the hell isn\u2019t this exploitation of children?\u201d is the one that immediately comes to mind, followed quickly by \u201cthis is modern day company scrip, we banned that ages ago\u201d.\n\nTo learn more about the absolutely wild world of Roblox, go watch How Roblox Is Exploiting Young Game Developers from People Make Games.\n\nEvery new thing I learn about Roblox makes me genuinely infuriated. You\u2019ve made a platform to let children build things and express their creativity and ruined it with so much garbage. The wall needs punching so bad.\n\nIf a child wants to learn how to write, they need a pen, some paper, and an imagination. The latter is free, the former cost a few pounds at most. If a child wants to learn to make computer games, they should be afforded a way to do so without entering into an exploitative relationship with some massive corporation who will pay them in scrip and keep two thirds of their earnings. Maybe we could build something that gives them the ability to make stuff and learn. And the thing they create is theirs rather than something that Roblox has a hand in.\n\nOn a broader societal level: politicians could pass legislation that is better if they thought about technology in a more nuanced way. The harshest bits of the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act only affects the twenty biggest online platforms, for instance. (Roblox isn\u2019t one of them, curiously.) This is unlike the UK\u2019s Online Safety Act which sets no compliance threshold, and so affects basically everyone. Even the most spooked parent probably doesn\u2019t stay up at night worrying about some kind of Adolescence-style scenario playing out with their little Jamie on the London Fixed Gear and Single Speed forum, a place where cycling nerds discuss, well, fixed gear and single speed bikes. Thankfully, they won\u2019t be troubled by this risk. The faff of complying with the Online Safety Act has led the site administrators to close it down. Google, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon et al. will be able to shoulder whatever regulatory burden anyone puts on them. But the legislation passed ostensibly to stick it to Big Tech has led to lots of people running little hobbyist forums having to read long and incredibly boring Ofcom documents, and take on substantial personal legal risk for their hobby websites if they get it wrong. If you do care about fixed gear bikes, I guess you could find a Facebook group to talk to others about it. That\u2019d really stick it to Zuck.\n\nWhat we lose when the entire debate becomes about the notion of \u201cscreen time\u201d and ghostly Satanic rectangles is a dream of someting better. Technology could actually be good and not something that we just hate using. It feels weird to say this because so much of technology is just the product of unpleasant, lazy, cynical people who don\u2019t give a damn. (Or maybe they do, but the incentive structures doesn\u2019t really allow them. The output looks the same.) And non-technical people not only can understand it deeply rather than in reductive tabloid soundbitey chunks and moral panics , they can help build it carefully, deliberatively and in a way that brings out more humanity.\n\nHow you achieve this is a topic I defer to far smarter people, so I can go finish the rest of the new Black Mirror which has turned out to be rather better than I expected it would.", "label": "non_personal"}

{"title": "TIL: track changes in Emacs with highlight-changes-mode", "url": "https://tommorris.org/posts/2025/til-track-changes-in-emacs-with-highlight-changes-mode/", "content": "I find myself having to review and edit a lot of plain text. You\u2019d think a \u201cbicycle for the mind\u201d could make this better.\n\nNon-programmers have Word\u2019s Tracked Changes. Or the Google Docs equivalent. The point of this is if Person A wrote a document, and sent it to Person B for review, Person B could make a bunch of changes, then send it back to Person A.\n\nProgrammers, meanwhile, have tools that are\u2026 more sophisticated? Like diff for one. Both Vim and Emacs have much more sophisticated versions of undo/redo, and tooling like undo-fu because that complexity can be a lot. Plus we have version control systems like Git (or even fancier stuff like Jujutsu which I can\u2019t get on with). If you have the self-discipline and/or tooling to commit lots of little \u201cwip: refactored\u201d changes, you can then use rebase -i , cherry-pick and friends to stitch all those little scraps into a beautiful series of atomic commits that tell a lovely story for both your future self and others. Or git commit -am \"did stuff\" and embrace the chaos demon. But version control is perhaps over-the-top for drafting emails, blog posts and the like.\n\n(If you\u2019re vibe coding, feel free to disregard. Version control is completely optional, and it\u2019s way funnier not to use it.)\n\nIf you write lots of prose, you (or a hallucinating chatbot acting on your behalf) frequently cranks out a crappy first version, or a rough outline, and then you want to go through and polish it meticulously until it doesn\u2019t suck. When doing this, you want to make sure you\u2019ve properly edited everything. If you\u2019ve been noodling around in the intro, then get distracted and pootle around elsewhere, you might entirely skip doing anything about entire paragraphs. In the early days of word procesing, one often printed out the first draft, grabbed a red pen to review it methodically, then returned to the computer to make the edits. While doing this, you could obviously tick off each paragraph after you\u2019ve reviewed it. As previously noted, I see great merit in taking notes by hand, and so, yes, great if you can. But that means you have to use printers which are cursed. And it is a lot of faff, so you often can\u2019t.\n\nThe print-it-out-then-redline-it method is what Tracked Changes reimplements electronically, but Tracked Changes seems to have a baked-in assumption that the person doing the reviewing is separate from the person who wrote it. Which is often the case in a corporate environment\u2026 but often not the case. Also, I don\u2019t wanna use Word or Word clones because plain text is good.\n\nWhat I want then is a way to visually see \u201cwhat have I changed?\u201d as I\u2019m editing a document.\n\nEnter Emacs highlight-changes-mode .\n\nOpen a buffer in Emacs. Type M-x highlight-changes-mode . Start editing. The text you change will be highlighted. The text you don\u2019t change won\u2019t be. If you delete some text, the closest character will be marked with a delete symbol. By default, the changed text is coloured red, and the delete symbol is an underscore.\n\nIf you M-x highlight-changes-mode again, the change markers go away.\n\nI found the default red to be a bit over-the-top, and would rather have the change applied to the background rather than the text itself (also, avoids affecting syntax highlighting). I picked a colour that better matched my preferences and theme.\n\n(custom-set-faces! '(highlight-changes :foreground nil :background \"#004272\") '(highlight-changes-delete :underline t :foreground nil :background \"#004272\"))\n\nHighlight Changes mode does some other stuff too\u2014you can have it cycle through multiple colours, and distinguish between saved and unsaved changes. You can bounce around between bits of the text that you\u2019ve changed and bits you haven\u2019t. I\u2019m not sure I need that\u2026 yet. The EmacsWiki has some other fun stuff about how people have used highlight changes, along with some grumpiness about the choice of colours.", "label": "non_personal"}

In general the changes seem good, but there is one proposed change that is concerning: allowing townhomes instead of apartments or condos on some large sites that ought to be developed as densely as possible (link to packet). There is a great deal of community opposition to these upzones, so I sent in a supportive note to the Planning Commission in advance of their evening meeting.\n\nIn support of higher density at Michael\u2019s and Goodwill sites\n\nTo the Kirkland Planning Commission:\n\nI am writing in favor of proposed zoning amendments to the Michael\u2019s and Goodwill sites to allow higher density, taller building heights, and reduced parking requirements. These rare anchor sites offer great potential to make the neighborhood denser and more walkable.\n\nI do not support allowing townhomes in this area \u2014 along arterial routes with transit access, with many goods and services within walking or biking distance, we ought to support as much housing density as feasible. Kirkland and the greater Seattle area are in desperate need of more housing, so I urge you to use the code to require higher densities in the BC1 zone. If we do not push for higher density where it makes sense \u2014 and it makes a great deal of sense here \u2014 then the overall amount of additional housing Kirkland can accommodate will be much lower than the need. Please require a minimum density for ADUs in this area as in Alternatives 1 or 2 from Appendix 5.", "label": "non_personal"}
{"title": "Generative AI as a magic system \u2013 Tracy Durnell's Mind Garden", "url": "https://tracydurnell.com/2025/06/24/generative-ai-as-a-magic-system/", "content": "We treat generative AI like magic\u2026 and magic systems have rules. When creating fantasy worlds, writers think about who can use magic, how magic is performed, what it\u2019s able to do, what its constraints are, what the source of magic is, and what it costs. I\u2019m applying a bit of reverse worldbuilding to the real world to extrapolate the rules of the AI magic system.\n\nIslands in the Sky by Death Valley Girls\n\nWho can use AI magic: magic users pay to use corporate AI magic systems. Those who are wealthy and tech savvy enough can host their own local model. Free magic use is mostly limited to corporate largesse ultimately intended to build magic dependency.\n\nHow AI magic is cast: AI spells are cast with written text input through a digital interface. Spells are refined and recast until the outcome satisfies (spells produce different results every time they are cast).\n\nWhat AI magic can do: AI spells can produce combinations of words that are interpreted as writing, code-like material that sometimes runs as code, images that resemble art, and video that resembles reality. It can create imitations of specific human creators\u2019 work, as well as individual\u2019s speech and appearance. It can also mimic human conversation for a span of time before the spell dissipates. AI magic is near instantaneous, allowing people without technical skills to produce text and graphics faster than writers and artisans.\n\nWhat AI magic cannot do: AI magic cannot produce the same outcome twice, nor act upon existing conjurations, instead casting spells anew each time. AI magic itself cannot reference sources, though may be used in tandem with other tools that enable citation (though with questionable accuracy). AI magic cannot reason or write, but its conjurations may create the illusion of intelligence through their statistical consistency with written language use.\n\nThe source of AI magic: AI magic derives from statistical analysis of human-created art, writing, speech, music, and video, classified and sorted by human laborers in low-cost geos.\n\nThe cost of AI magic: Resource costs of AI magic include power, water, and high-end chips, which themselves require specialized manufacturing and rare earth minerals.\n\nSocial costs include the reinforcement of racism and sexism, as well as mental harm to AI trainers assessing inputs to the magic system.\n\nSocietal costs include job elimination and job intensification as positions able to be reproduced in part by magic are eliminated and that magic work is shifted to the remaining workers.\n\nInformation costs include the destruction of the online publishing incentive structure / information commons, leading to more paywalled content; an increase in low-quality material, which makes finding accurate information harder; as well as the danger of political propaganda by poisoned magic systems.\n\nIndividual user costs include critical thinking skills, writing abilities, and patience for conversing with humans.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nThe new magic of AI vs. the old magic of artists by Kening Zhu\n\nSee also:\n\nGenerative AI and the Business Borg aesthetic", "label": "non_personal"}
{"title": "Copyright anti-circumvention: an AI hypothetical", "url": "https://tommorris.org/posts/2024/copyright-anti-circumvention-ai-hypothetical/", "content": "Imagine there is an American company called FancySiri Inc. who make a commercially available large language model similar to those offered by Google, OpenAI, Anthropic etc. It provides a chatbot service similar to ChatGPT, Gemini, et al. where users can ask questions and get a load of synthetic text of dubious provenance and accuracy that purports to answer the question they asked.\n\nNow imagine there is a person, let\u2019s call him Keith Jones. Keith is a British citizen and runs a website hosted in the UK. Every page on his website is marked with \u201cCopyright \u00a9 2024 Keith Jones. All rights reserved.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Keith places Schema.org metadata in the page, in a manner broadly as follows:\n\n<body vocab=\"https://schema.org/\" typeof=\"WebPage\"> ... <footer> <span property=\"copyrightNotice\"> Copyright \u00a9 <span property=\"copyrightYear\">2024</span> <span property=\"copyrightHolder\" typeof=\"Person\"> <span property=\"name\">Keith Jones</span> </span>. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_rights_reserved\" property=\"license\">All rights reserved.</a> </span> </footer> </body>\n\n(Other metadata standards are available: microformats, DC terms etc. Pick whichever one you hate least.)\n\nKeith is not particularly impressed with the trend towards artificial intelligence, so he obtains a list of the User Agents of commercially available large language models that happens to include well-known existing services already mentioned and our hypothetical FancySiri Inc. (ai.robots.txt or similar lists on the web)\n\nKeith puts up a robots.txt file and implements filtering based on User Agent string matching to always return an HTTP 401 Unauthorized response to known AI/LLM scrapers including FancySiri. This denies them access to his beautifully curated collection of tasteful cat pictures and discussions of the nerdiest of minutiae concerning programming in Rust.\n\nFancySiri Inc. have published on their website\u2019s legal FAQ that they comply with robots.txt and only scrape material using the User-Agent specified, \u201cFancySiriBot\u201d.\n\nUnfortunately, they lied.\n\nEither they did not respect the contents of Keith\u2019s robots.txt, or they ran a second scraper that uses the User Agent string of a human-operated web browser. Like, say \u201cMozilla/5.0 (iPhone14,3; U; CPU iPhone OS 15_0 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/602.1.50 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/10.0 Mobile/19A346 Safari/602.1\u201d (for those not familiar with reading User Agent strings, this UA is for an iPhone 13 Pro Max running iOS 15).\n\nA tech company lying? Shocking, I know.\n\nKeith learns that a blog post he published about some particularly abstruse Rust minutiae has become part of the training data used for FancySiri\u2019s large language model. For instance, when the FancySiri chatbot is asked about the rather niche topic, the server returns words that are so remarkably close to Keith\u2019s blog post that it\u2019s beyond any doubt where it came from.\n\nKeith is rather puzzled about this and takes a break from photographing his cat and writing Rust to peruse the UK\u2019s Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988. After some consideration, he has some interesting questions. Purely hypothetically, one must note. He does not have the money to take FancySiri Inc. to court, and has a wise policy of avoiding civil litigation on the very reasonable basis that he enjoys not being sad all the time.\n\nDoes the publication of a robots.txt file and the use of a User-Agent matching traffic block amount to an effective technological protection measure as defined by s296ZF of the CDPA? Assuming the answer to (1) is yes, has FancySiri Inc. circumvented those measures knowing, or with reasonable grounds, to know that they are trying to circumvent it? That is to say, have they breached s296ZA of the CDPA? Is the machine readable metadata on Keith\u2019s webpage \u201crights management information\u201d under the definition given in s296ZG(7)(b)? If the answer to (4) is yes, has FancySiri Inc. \u201cremoved or altered\u201d the rights management information from Keith\u2019s website? If the answer to (5) is yes, are there reasons on which a court could reasonably conclude that FancySiri Inc. did so \u201cknowingly and without authority\u201d while knowing or having reason to believe that by doing so they are inducing, enabling, facilitating, or concealing an infringement of copyright (per s296ZG)?\n\nIf you\u2019re a nerd, feel free to re-run this exercise with the particular anti-circumvention rules as implemented in your preferred jurisdiction. They\u2019re all fairly similar because large chunks of copyright law is the product of international agreements (in this case, the 1996 WIPO Copyright Treaty).\n\nThe rough intuition behind this hypothetical is as follows: anti-circumvention rules are really strong. The domain of things which they protect has expanded way beyond the original purpose (computer software and other creative works including music, books, movies, visual arts etc.) to afford copyright protection to the DRM on ink cartridges, tractors and ventilators (the latter being a particularly unpleasant illustration of the prioritisation of corporate greed over human life during the COVID pandemic). Such a broad legal rule could also potentially allow a suitably placed claimant to challenge\u2014at least, in theory\u2014the use of online materials by AI companies.\n\nThe UK government are currently consulting on Copyright and Artificial Intelligence, though they seem to have not mentioned the application of anti-circumvention rules (either in the consultation document or the summary assessment of options document). Some of the questions the government are consulting on\u2014specifically about machine-readable methods for \u201creserving rights\u201d\u2014would seem to envision a regime where one has to take specific technical steps to protect works from infringement. Hence they kind of run in parallel to the anti-circumvention rules already in the CDPA and similar instruments. It might be sensible to ensure they don\u2019t conflict, or cause confusion.\n\nIf the government wish to amend the copyright laws to broaden the current limited data mining exception to cover AI training, that policy goal could be undermined by the use of anti-circumvention rules against the same AI companies they seek to, uh, liberate. That said, under the principle of \u201cwhat\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander\u201d, perhaps Keith should be afforded the same maximalist level of protection of the intellectual property in his cat pictures and blog posts about Rust programming as companies like HP and Lexmark have greatly benefitted from when it comes to stopping people using \u201cpirate ink\u201d in their inkjet printers.\n\nAppendix: relevant CDPA passages\n\nThe relevant passages of the legislation are included below for interested readers. For those who enjoy reading legislation, the whole text is on legislation.gov.uk for your perusal. I have tried to chop out as much that isn\u2019t relevant as humanly possible.\n\nOne thing to note is that s296 deals with anti-circumvention of computer software while s296ZA-ZF deal with anti-circumvention as applied to everything else. Since the problem concerns a blog post (which might contain incidental bits of computer code in trivial quantities), I\u2019ve used the non-code sections. If the hypothetical concerned, say, a self-hosted Gitea instance containing a bunch of code, the s296 code version would apply instead.\n\nSection 296ZA: Circumvention of technological measures\n\n(1) This section applies where\u2014 (a) effective technological measures have been applied to a copyright work other than a computer program; and (b) a person (B) does anything which circumvents those measures knowing, or with reasonable grounds to know, that he is pursuing that objective.\n\n(Subsection (2) omitted - it deals with cryptographic research, which isn\u2019t going on here.)\n\n(3) The following persons have the same rights against B as a copyright owner has in respect of an infringement of copyright\u2014 (a) a person\u2014 (i) issuing to the public copies of, or (ii) communicating to the public, the work to which effective technological measures have been applied; and (b) the copyright owner or his exclusive licensee, if he is not the person specified in paragraph (a).\n\nThe remaining subsections are omitted: (4) deals with concurrent rights, (5) deals with procedural and evidential matters, while (6) and (7) concern rights in performance, publication rights, an database rights - all of which are not dealt with in the hypothetical.\n\nSection 296ZF: Interpretation of sections 296ZA to 295ZEA\n\n(1) In sections 296ZA to 296ZE, \u201ctechnological measures\u201d are any technology, device or component which is designed, in the normal course of its operation, to protect a copyright work other than a computer program. (2) Such measures are \u201ceffective\u201d if the use of the work is controlled by the copyright owner through\u2014 (a) an access control or protection process such as encryption, scrambling or other transformation of the work, or (b) a copy control mechanism, which achieves the intended protection. (3) In this section, the reference to\u2014 (a) protection of a work is to the prevention or restriction of acts that are not authorised by the copyright owner of that work and are restricted by copyright; and (b) use of a work does not extend to any use of the work that is outside the scope of the acts restricted by copyright. (4) Expressions used in sections 296ZA to 296ZEA which are defined for the purposes of Part 1 of this Act (copyright) have the same meaning as in that Part.\n\nSection 296ZG: Electronic rights management information\n\n(1) This section applies where a person (D), knowingly and without authority, removes or alters electronic rights management information which\u2014 (a) is associated with a copy of a copyright work, or (b) appears in connection with the communication to the public of a copyright work, and where D knows, or has reason to believe, that by so doing he is inducing, enabling, facilitating or concealing an infringement of copyright.\n\nSubsection (2) concerns importing and is not relevant.\n\n(3) A person issuing to the public copies of, or communicating, the work to the public, has the same rights against D and E as a copyright owner has in respect of an infringement of copyright. (4) The copyright owner or his exclusive licensee, if he is not the person issuing to the public copies of, or communicating, the work to the public, also has the same rights against D and E as he has in respect of an infringement of copyright.

It\u2019s a sharecropping system, but the sharecroppers are generally happy because their interest lies in self-expression or socializing, not in making money, and, besides, the economic value of each of their individual contributions is trivial. It\u2019s only by aggregating those contributions on a massive scale \u2013 on a web scale \u2013 that the business becomes lucrative. To put it a different way, the sharecroppers operate happily in an attention economy while their overseers operate happily in a cash economy.\n\nI encountered this (old) analogy for social media platforms as digital sharecropping and thought it also fit generative AI. Generative AI companies steal our intellectual property then license it back to us. We can\u2019t be compensated reasonably for our individual contributions to the model because they\u2019ve stolen from so many of us and each individual\u2019s work represents a miniscule portion of the entire model. Whatever we generate with their models can\u2019t be copyrighted and used to make money for *us* without significant human contributions \u2014 but generated works are in direct competition with the creators whose works built the model. These powerful, well-funded companies want businesses to fire their employees and pay them instead, making businesses reliant on an opaque, unpredictable service that demands vast amounts of natural resources that may be in short \u2014 and shortening \u2014 supply.\n\nBut unlike social media, which rewards users emotionally rather than financially for their labor, creators aren\u2019t getting anything out of having our work used to train generative AI models. And so we\u2019re fighting back earlier in the cycle than with social media \u2014 maybe before it can become entrenched. AI evangelists speak as if the technology\u2019s supremacy is inevitable, but that\u2019s propaganda to get us to shut up and hand over our creations and our jobs.\n\nRecent AI shenanigans in the news:\n\nChatGPT caught giving horrible advice to cancer patients by Sharon Adarlo (Neoscope)\n\nWhy Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest AI developers are hiring poets by Andrew Deck (rest of world)\n\nIowa Is Using ChatGPT to Take Out Banned Books by Alejandra Gularte (Vulture)\n\nGenerative AI at work", "label": "non_personal"}

Stowing your carry-on wasn\u2019t a competitive sport back in the day.).\n\nThe aesthetics of generative AI\n\n\u201cI have become momentarily obsessed with scrolling down the homepage of the MetaAI tool and seeing the infinite feed of what people have been asking of The Machine. The outputs are horribly banal, but the requests are a weird window into THE (NORMIE) HUMAN SOUL AND ITS DESIRES: www.meta.ai\u201d\n\n\u2014 Matt Muir, May 6, 2025 at 8:51 AM\n\n(via)\n\nBy its nature, generative AI produces the most likely image that meets the brief, which devolves to insipid Pictionary-style visual communication: chonky = cat, kebab = food = French chef\u2019s hat. These graphics are iconographic pablum, the uninspired result of gee-whiz curiosity about a new \u201ctool\u201d (toy)(trap) in an environment that discourages personal taste and cultural literacy.\n\nOriginally, I wrote up why I find these particular graphics tacky and visually uninteresting, but realized that ultimately, what they look like doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 it\u2019s the beliefs beneath the appearance that matter. As corporate models are trained further, Generative AI will probably continue to get better, rendering more attractive and/or plausible outputs, but it won\u2019t matter to me how good it gets because I reject the values it represents.\n\n(NB: I don\u2019t want you to feel bad about yourself if you use generative AI, because there are myriad reasons to have experimented with it, including being forced to for your employment; I want you to recognize what it symbolizes when you enthusiastically use this technology today, and make an informed choice about whether those are values you wish to signal to others.)\n\n\u201cWhat is wrong with a counterfeit is not what it is like, but how it was made.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Harry G. Frankfurt, On Bullshit\n\nAesthetics are looks that signal values\n\nWitching Hour by Ladytron\n\nAn aesthetic is an expression of taste for shared values, commonly communicated through a distinct style. We think of aesthetics as surface appearance only, but the formation of an aesthetic\u2019s conventions reflects the why and the how underneath the what. Just as the medium of a thing carries a message, so does its aesthetic. Aesthetics are visually and verbally encoded value systems.\n\nIdeology is a value system, independent of appearances. Aesthetics are the appearance of an ideology, which grow from its values. Subcultures form around ideologies, with members signaling their participation through aesthetics. \u201cGood taste\u201d is aesthetics that express those values.\n\nThough it\u2019s now often reduced to a visual style, the Arts and Crafts movement of the late 1800s and early 1900s was cross-disciplinary and united instead by an ethos \u2014 namely, the nobility of craftsmanship*:\n\n\u201cFor it is not the material, but the absence of human labor, which makes the thing worthless, and a piece of terracotta, or plaster of paris, which has been wrought by the human hand, is worth all the stone and Carrara cut by machinery.\u201d \u2014 John Ruskin, The Lamp of Truth from The Seven Lamps of Architecture\n\nAccording to the Arts and Crafts aesthetic, what is made should signal how it is made \u2014 the aesthetic\u2019s value system weights how something is made to be as important, if not more, as what is made. Surface appearance is borne of the decisions this taste for craft produces.\n\n*(People might instead think of this William Morris quote as the quintessential perspective of Arts and Crafts \u2014 \u201cHave nothing in your house that you do not know to be useful, or believe to be beautiful.\u201d \u2014 and I suspect there\u2019s a reason we\u2019ve been taught to recall a philosophy centered on material possession instead of labor.)\n\nLooking at a Kelmscott Press book (William Morris\u2019 printing company) reveals the printer\u2019s respect for handicraft: they designed custom drop letters and frames, included original illustrations by fine artists like Edward Burne-Jones, used original type modeled after typefaces used by printers like Aldus Manutius in the early days of the printing press, printed with a richer black ink than was standard at the time, and employed a heavy hand in letterpress printing so the design and type would be impressed into the page. Thoughtful, intentional ornamentation is embraced. The artifact itself is a thing to be appreciated as much as its contents; these are books that honor the integrity of all creative workers involved in their production.\n\nEmily Amick applies this analytical lens to reveal the tradwife aesthetic\u2019s underlying values:\n\nPrairie-core. Domestic bliss. Big sleeves. Bigger sourdough starters. And beneath it all, the subtle (or not-so-subtle) message: a woman\u2019s place is in the kitchen. But not because she wants to be there, because that\u2019s where God or her husband or some TikTok algorithm put her. The tradwife aesthetic promises comfort, but it delivers control. It\u2019s softness as a strategy. It\u2019s anti-feminism with a floral filter. It\u2019s nostalgia for a time when women were property, romanticized by influencers who want brand deals from butter. [\u2026] The tradwife says: give up your autonomy and someone else will take care of everything.\n\nWe adopt aesthetics based on aspirational values\n\nJessica Cullen writes that (emphasis mine): \u201cAesthetics aren\u2019t always about who we currently are but rather who we want to be.\u201d People adopt an aesthetic to say something about themselves to others. We intentionally adopt a particular subculture\u2019s aesthetics to convey our belonging and raise our status within the subculture. As Alec Leach puts it, \u201ca lot of the modern taste economy is actually the status economy.\u201d\n\nSometimes, we perceive only the surface level of an aesthetic, its appearance without the values \u2014 as Amick notes, the tradwife aesthetic \u201clooks so damn pretty and nourishing. And we are tired.\u201d \u2014 but whenever we adopt an aesthetic, we endorse (intentionally or not) the underlying values it represents. Amick continues dissecting the tradwife aesthetic and how it serves as conservative propaganda:\n\nWhat looks like innocent lifestyle content is actually part of an organized political movement designed to make patriarchy look cozy and appealing. Because politics is downstream from culture. The vibes that influence how we act and live.\n\nAesthetics matter more than ever because we act in accordance with our chosen aesthetics. As we get more and more of our \u201ccultural\u201d content on corporate silos, politics and purchases have subsumed a lot of cultural tastemaking. In this TikTok, Jamelle Bouie describes how politicians use aesthetic signaling to appeal to voters. Richard Sennett identifies that politicians come to embody \u201cintentions, desires, values, beliefs, tastes \u2013 an emphasis which has again the effect of divorcing power from responsibility.\u201d\n\nAnu Atluru argues that \u201cAesthetics are the modern units of cultural currency\u2014stores of value and instruments of power, capable of appreciating and being monetized at scale. Owning an aesthetic is owning influence.\u201d (emphasis mine)\n\nInterrogating the Business Borg aesthetic\n\nGlass Lux by Glass Lux\n\nThe Arts and Craft movement\u2019s respect for labor inspired stylistic choices that highlighted craftwork as well as the decisions in what goods to produce and how. So how does the Business Borg aesthetic reveal its values?\n\nTo define the Business Borg aesthetic, I\u2019m looking at:\n\nthe values I see expressed through generative media,\n\nI see expressed through generative media, the actions of the corporations behind generative AI,\n\nof the corporations behind generative AI, who buys into generative AI, and\n\nbuys into generative AI, and what else they like that reflects the same underlying values.\n\nWhat genAI is better at than a human artist is being cheap and instant.\n\nThe Business Borg aesthetic uses technology to signal wealth and power. Generative AI is not the only visual expression of the Business Borg aesthetic, just its most recognizable. The aesthetic is also signified visually by CGI-heavy blockbuster franchises, NFT art, and the Cybertruck; and in text by LinkedIn corporate thirst traps, X braggadocio, SEO word vomit, and generated \u201canswers\u201d to search results.\n\nAs political bedpartners, there is overlap between the Business Borg aesthetic and the MAGA aesthetic, but they\u2019re distinct viewpoints. Both share dominance as a core value, decry empathy, center patriarchy, and admire performance \u2014 but MAGA also signals Judeo-Christian morality, traditional beauty standards / traditional gender roles, hyper masculinity / violence, and nationalism. MAGA borrows aesthetics from golden pasts, like Neo-Classical architecture, tradwives, and, as Kate Wagner brands it, Regional Car Dealership Rococo; Business Borg prefer the more modern tones of cyberpunk, solarpunk, and minimalism. Business Borg are regulatory libertarians who envision themselves as the rightful leaders of society, Kings of techno-city-states; MAGA are Christian nationalists who want to use the power of the state to impose their beliefs on others.\n\nElon is a Business Borg at heart but wielded a chainsaw to appeal to the more violent MAGA aesthetic. Zuckerberg is a Business Borg but got a MAGA makeover with masculine stubble and bling.\n\nWhy am I naming this after the Borg? Like Star Trek\u2019s Borg, this is an aesthetic rooted in extractive consumption, assimilationist dominance, neo-colonial expansionism, self-righteous conviction, reductionist thinking, and proclamations of inevitability. It idolizes technology, often inspired by older science-fiction, and draws on cyberpunk aesthetics. The Silicon Valley Collective values groupthink and believes themselves superior to \u201cthe other.\u201d\n\nWho embraces this aesthetic\n\nNot all users of Generative AI embrace the Business Borg aesthetic. I think a lot of people are experimenting with generative AI out of neophilic curiosity, productivity imperatives, nihilistic determinism, and corporate fiat. Aspiring billionaires adopt the Business Borg aesthetic to signal their belonging in the cohort of the techno-rich.\n\nGenAI evangelists seem to be the same type of person who was into passive income and supplements fifteen years ago, then Soylent and SEO ten years ago, then NFTs and macro diets five years ago, now genAI and X blue checks.\n\nThe Business Borg aesthetic combines tech-centered neophilia, a hustle mindset, an obsession with optimization, evangelical fervor, and fake-it-till-you-make-it showmanship.\n\nThe Elon fanclub are Business Borg. Ed Zitron\u2019s Business Idiot shares a lot of characteristics with Business Borg (and may even be the same group, but I think feels a little different?).\n\nThe subculture emphasizes high profile demonstrations of \u201cwinning\u201c \u2014 using a $10k NFT as their X profile pic, bragging about SEO heists ripping off a competitor, generosity stunts a la Mr Beast, rubbing it in Miyazaki\u2019s face that there will be thousands of shitty knockoffs vaguely reminiscent of his work across the web.\n\nBusiness Borg signal their busyness \u2014 and importance \u2014 by broadcasting how little they sleep, how much they work, and how little they read. The only fiction they like is (old) sci-fi because they read it as non-fiction, not fiction \u2014 a source of \u201cinspiration\u201d stripped of context and commentary. Using GenAI signals their adoption of cutting edge technology, the synthetic smoothness emphasizing its nonhuman origin. They care a lot about IQ, a supposedly impartial measure of intelligence that rewards their backgrounds and thinking styles, and idolize \u201cgenius.\u201d They\u2019re not actually neurodivergent, but play on stereotypes of autistic savants to cover for their pathological greed and lack of empathy.\n\nTheir visual and linguistic taste is mid because taste is not valued in the Business Borg aesthetic. In fact, there\u2019s a certain pride in prompting things without having any skill, an almost gleeful snub to the perceived cultural gatekeepers \u2014 artists and writers and other creative workers \u2014 whose opinions the Business Borg disrespect because they believe that authority derives from money, not knowledge. They believe artists have wasted their time learning skills and developing taste. Academics have wasted their time studying things when information is just a click away. Business Borg don\u2019t care about anything besides making money, and don\u2019t care much how they spend it because the point is to have it, and show off that they have it.\n\nInto The Water by Ritual Howls\n\nGenAI True Believers often resemble the CEOs at the head of tech companies: wealthy, male, and white. These are also the people who are least at threat from the widespread use of generative AI, which reinforces racial and gender stereotypes and purports neutrality while serving up right-wing biases and corporate and foreign propaganda. Audrey Watters points out:\n\n\u201cComputing (in general and ed-tech specifically) has long been the bastion of white male privilege; and while there had been efforts to change that \u2013 in pipelines and on panels and whatnot \u2013 AI is clearly a re-entrenchment of that power, explicitly so with the Trump Administration\u2019s dismantling of civil rights protections, echoed by the tech industry\u2019s dismantling of its own DEI initiatives.\u201d\n\nAnil Dash describes \u201cAI-first\u201d as this year\u2019s \u201cReturn to Office.\u201d Managers didn\u2019t care about in-office culture until it was made clear that workers could carry on just fine without them; managers care about AI only insomuch as it permits controlling \u2014 and firing \u2014 workers.\n\nWhat the Business Borg aesthetic represents is more important than its appearance; it represents the dominance of ordinal thinking and the ability of moneyed power to do as it wishes without regard to law or morality \u2014 in short, the hierarchical worldview that some people are better than others and that their preferences trump their lesser\u2019s needs.\n\n\u201cWe will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own. Your culture will adapt to service us. Resistance is futile.\u201d \u2014 the Borg\n\nValues driving the Business Borg aesthetic\n\nTeri Kanefield breaks down Leor Zmigrod\u2019s book on ideology, explaining that \u201cAll ideologies seek a utopia.\u201d The Business Borg utopia puts billionaires and their ilk high atop society, in control via the technology they own.\n\nCore values I see uniting the Business Borg aesthetic are:\n\nonly the output matters efficiency is king quantity over quality appearance trumps reality \u201cprogress\u201d cannot be stopped\n\nValue: Only the output matters\n\nGenerative AI is being marketed to businesses as a low-cost replacement for workers that cuts steps \u2014 and collaboration \u2014 out of the process. This is a box-checking culture; all that matters is that an email was sent, a presentation was created, the newspaper had a summer reading insert, no matter the books on it were imaginary.\n\nFoundational beliefs\n\nprocess does not add value and wastes time\n\nthe world is reducible to data , and every question has one objectively correct answer\n\n, and every question has communication and collaboration are a waste of time (\u201cemail jobs\u201d)\n\n(\u201cemail jobs\u201d) experience is irrelevant\n\nOutcome: Tech reduces the complex to input and output\n\nIn contrast with the Arts and Crafts movement, the Business Borg aesthetic actively conceals human labor and venerates the wisdom of the machine. Generative text and graphics simulate a performance of human-less \u2014 cost-less \u2014 automation. Generative answers encourage a reliance on the machine to synthesize on one\u2019s behalf \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t matter to search engines that the \u201canswers\u201d their AI has provided cite sources incorrectly.\n\nHumans are perceived as sources of inefficiency under the Business Borg ideology, because they must be compensated in accordance with their skills and how much time they spend working. Generating material is rooted in devaluing both skill and process. The invented summer reading list was the result of forcing a single contractor to prepare an impossible quantity of work; generating content was the only way for the poor bloke to produce the content on budget. No one reviewed it, because Business Borg only care that the product exists.\n\nEd Zitron describes the evolution of the Business Idiot, personified by middle managers who are completely dissociated from the product they\u2019re selling and explicitly do not do work (emphasis mine):\n\n[Business Idiots] see every part of our lives as a series of inputs and outputs. They boast about how many books they\u2019ve read rather than the content of said books, about how many hours they work (even though they never, ever work that many), about high level they are in a video game they clearly don\u2019t play, about the money they\u2019ve raised and the scale they\u2019ve raised it at, and about how expensive and fancy their kitchen gadgets are. Everything is dominance, acquisition, growth and possession over any lived experience, because their world is one where the journey doesn\u2019t matter, because their journeys are riddled with privilege and the persecution of others in the pursuit of success. These people don\u2019t want to automate work, they want to automate existence. They fantasize about hitting a button and something happening, because experiencing \u2014 living! \u2014 is beneath them, or at least your lives and your wants and your joy are.\n\nValue: Efficiency is king\n\nGenerative AI produces endless content for low cost. Corporations are using Generative AI as an excuse to lay off workers and intensify the jobs of those remaining.\n\nReady Aim Fire (Owl Vision Remix) [Single] by Blue Stahli\n\nFoundational beliefs\n\nthe more mechanized a process is, the more efficient it becomes because humans are naturally inefficient\n\nOutcome: GenAI performs \u201cefficiency\u201d\n\nGenerative AI need not actually reduce work or cost to represent efficiency when mechanization is always favored over people. The Business Borg aesthetic perceives automation as efficient \u2014 hence situations where workers are paid to simulate chatbots simulating human agents on customer service platforms, Microsoft devs handhold Copilot, and GM\u2019s Cruise \u201cautonomous\u201d taxis needed remote human intervention every 4-5 miles!!!\n\nEfficiency is a code word for shareholders, just like \u201ccost-cutting,\u201d who know that these phrases mean putting the boot on workers\u2019 necks for short-term profits. This efficiency aesthetic is used to justify outrageously profitable companies continuing to slash workers *cough Microsoft* It plays out as Hollywood demolishing the screenwriter profession to save a buck on writing rooms and self-cannibalizing the development of future acting talent by forcing extras to be body scanned so they can be reproduced by AI.\n\nJeremy comments on the use of genAI in coding, noting that it\u2019s justified by claims like \u201cworking code wins\u201d \u2014 as in, what it looks like under the hood and how it\u2019s constructed don\u2019t matter. I\u2019m not a coder, but I\u2019ve seen enough HTML produced by PageMaker and other CMSs to be skeptical of the quality of any generated code \u2014 is genAI producing the coding equivalent of tables for web layout? \ud83e\udd14 The Business Borg aesthetic accepts mediocrity without understanding; easy and fast is always best. Good enough is always good enough.\n\nValue: Quantity over quality\n\nGenerative AI is billed as a good-enough tool that will speed up production. Cory Doctorow writes of the managerial push to automate with AI:\n\nThe point of using automation to weaken labor isn\u2019t just cheaper products \u2013 it\u2019s cheaper, defective products, inflicted on the unsuspecting and defenseless public who are no longer protected by workers\u2019 professionalism and pride in their jobs.\n\nEnormous by LLgL TNDR\n\nFoundational beliefs\n\nprofit today trumps tomorrow\u2019s concerns \u2014 someone else will have to fix \u2018that problem\u2019\n\n\u2014 someone else will have to fix \u2018that problem\u2019 money is authority \u2014 individual rankings can be quantified by wealth\n\n\u2014 individual rankings can be quantified by wealth anything that cannot be quantified is not important\n\nOutcome: Algorithms produce culture-like media, not culture\n\nGenAI and corporate web algorithms are intended to absorb attention like black absorbs light; they are designed to maximize engagement at minimal cost. Spotify benefits from degradation of culture. Netflix is a chum machine, built to spew content that people watch in the background. Kyle Raymond Fitzpatrick laments that \u201cSo much of culture is edgeless and soft, intended for us to astroglide through it without any friction or doubt as we half-watch in 1.5x speed, to consume as if we really are incapable of critical thoughts, all to appeal to everyone and no one at the same time.\u201d Internet Age capitalism produces entertainment that is culture-like, writes Nicholas Carr:\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really being tested here is human taste. Will we accept a simulacrum of a work of art or craft as a satisfactory substitute for the real thing?\u201d\n\nSo long as people accept cheap low-quality cultural media, businesses have little incentive to pay for higher quality. Generative AI becomes an attack on culture because it drowns out human-made art and writing so it\u2019s impossible to find amidst the Great Social Media Garbage Patch. Aidan Walker describes all this as \u2018 slop capitalism \u2018: \u201can economic and cultural system in which the primary product is slop and the primary activity is the destruction of value rather than its creation.\u201d\n\nValue: Appearances trump reality\n\nGenerative AI produces plausible graphics that we interpret as real-adjacent and plausible combinations of text that we interpret as communication.\n\nFoundational Beliefs\n\nperformance of dominance builds and reinforces real power\n\nOutcome: GenAI supersedes reality with performance and symbolism\n\nThe Business Borg aesthetic celebrates audacious performances of infinite wealth and indefinite power: adopters and evangelists for genAI also embrace filling streets with \u201cself-driving\u201d cars over the protests of residents and first responders, raining space debris onto inhabited areas from slapdash rocket ships, paying a fortune for a banana taped to a wall as conceptual art and eating it, paying women to have their IVF babies so they can seem fertile without fucking. While the culture at large has shifted towards inconspicuous consumption, luxury that requires knowledge to see, Business Borg signal their wealth blatantly.\n\nA repeating theme of the Business Borg aesthetic is replacing reality with life-like hyperreality: the simulation of conversation and connection with chatbots, the renderings of war and disaster mimicking photojournalism to push political narratives, the \u201cresurrected\u201d extinct species, the green screen action sequences that don\u2019t track. A photograph of reality may seem less real than a generated image if it does not abide by our expectations. (See also: reading \u201chuman vibes\u201d into LLM responses)\n\nLook at the snoozefest kayfabe of modern MMA: it\u2019s as much about the smack talk at weigh-ins as the fights themselves, athletes winning by points for \u201ccontrolling the octagon\u201d instead of fighting to win by KO or submission \u2014 look no further than that embarrassment of a so-called fight between Mike Tyson and the YouTuber, who danced around an old man till he got tired so he could win by decision and say he\u2019d beaten a legend \ud83d\ude34\n\nEffective altruism performs charity that can never be disproven, despite its claims of data-driven decisions, because it pretends to think at such long-term scales that known, existing suffering pales in comparison to the imagined future suffering they claim to be protecting against. It cosplays rationalism. Wannabe Foundation shit.\n\nThe Business Borg aesthetic is expressed as cheap cruft disguised as something of substance: words that look like writing, but are not; images that look like art, but are not; fights that look fighting, but are not.\n\nAs Ed Zitron sums up, it\u2019s a \u201csymbolic economy:\u201d\n\nThe sweeping changes we\u2019ve seen, both in our economy and in our society, has led to an unprecedented, gilded age of bullshit where nothing matters, and things \u2014 things of actual substance \u2014 matter nothing.\n\nTraditionally, we have been wary of those wearing a mask, explains Dan Fox in Pretentiousness, suspecting they are something other than what they present themselves as \u2014 but authenticity has faded as a cultural value. Business Borg embrace performance as more true than reality; what someone wants to be is more important than what they are now. What a technology could be is more important than what it currently is.\n\nValue: \u201cProgress\u201d cannot be stopped\n\nThe rapacious assimilation of copyrighted material to train models, the dismissal of AI\u2019s environmental cost and induced demand, and PR campaign reorienting the conversation around AI to its possible future harms as a distraction from the harms happening today all build from the same foundation: theoretically, scaling towards the pursuit of AGI \u2014 but more likely securing the funding to inextricably embed AI into our society and infrastructure.\n\nFoundational Beliefs\n\ntechnology always represents progress\n\nthe ends justify the means\n\nOutcome: GenAI is full speed ahead, no matter what\n\nAdvocates of generative AI are pursuing a brute force, fear-mongering approach to deregulation and preventing regulation. They are defying legality in obtaining training data while declaring the technology a fait accompli: resistance is futile. Their web crawlers ignore robots.txt, breaking the common courtesy of the web. They dismiss complaints about bias, claiming that they can fix that in the future. (And what incentive will there be to ever go back and fix it, once we can\u2019t avoid using it?) They\u2019re hoping enough of us will get hooked on it \u2014 and government and corporations will integrate enough of it too deeply in their processes \u2014 to allow their legally-suspect models to be shut down.\n\nRyan Broderick observes:\n\nWhat the AI arms race has actually done is codified and automated all of the failures of the previous internet era. Extremism, misinformation, harassment, non-consensual sexual material, and scams \u2014 all the content that tech companies promised to fix, but never could at scale \u2014 are now trapped in some AI\u2019s black box of data.\n\nAGI, which has been \u201cthree to five years away\u201d for years, is a Bezzle. As Cory Doctorow quotes JK Gabraith, a Bezzle is \u201cthe magic interval when a confidence trickster knows he has the money he has appropriated but the victim does not yet understand that he has lost it.\u201d John Kay expands that \u201cThe joy of the bezzle is that two people \u2013 each ignorant of the other\u2019s existence and role \u2013 can enjoy the same wealth.\u201d\n\nScams and pyramid schemes are seductive to Business Borg, like Elizabeth Holmes and Sam Bankman-Fried, because the only things they value are money and power, not making things that actually work (see: Cybertrucks falling apart, SpaceX rockets exploding); the trick is not to get caught. The goal is to surf the edge of profit as long as possible.\n\nRight now the whole stock market is bloated by outrageous NVIDIA, Google, Microsoft and Meta valuations based on the potential of generative AI to create a new \u201cessential\u201d utility, a service that everyone will need to subscribe to, forever \u2014 and so many people have bought into the grift so hard they\u2019ll do anything they can to make it a success, or at least rake in the cash for as long as they can. Then when the bubble pops, the corporations will get bailed out on the taxpayer dollar, while we workers resign ourselves to working until we die since we\u2019ve privatized retirement \ud83d\ude43\n\nGenAI is being deployed to control\n\nArtists are under attack, culturally and economically, so it is only fair that they point out the quintessential thing that artists offer that generative AI cannot: taste. Professional (and amateur) artists have devoted a great deal of time to developing their taste. The oligarchs who run Silicon Valley are steeped in their own rightness and devalue anything that isn\u2019t their expertise; if they don\u2019t know about it, it must not be important. To the Business Borg, taste is not an essential component of production.\n\nMandy Brown describes how genAI is used to undercut expertise (emphasis mine):\n\nIt\u2019s instructive that one of the mechanisms for perpetuating this ideology are chattering bots that speak both fact and falsehood in the same servile and confident tone, their makers unconcerned with the difference. In fact, their makers seem entirely concerned with obviating that difference, with disappearing distinctions between knowledge and ignorance, without which truth becomes entirely a product of power. [\u2026] [I]f those in power cannot prove that a great many people are already inferior then they will bring that inferiority about by forcing them to use a tool that diminishes their intellectual and creative capacity.\n\nBusiness Borg like generative AI because it grants them cultural power that they have not been able to dominate on their own. They lack skill, so they devalue skill. They need content, so they make an infinite content machine and conscript users as unwitting factory workers to provide free labor. The relentless promotion of GenAI is an attempt by corporations to capture cultural value by siphoning off value from human-made aesthetics. Generative AI is billionaires punching down on artists and the working class.\n\n[\u2026] I think Miyazaki\u2019s style is still valuable But it is now, in a day, valuable in a different way. What was once valuable in the awareness of painstaking labor, beautiful stories, and coherent aesthetic across the previous two qualities. PLUS our reception to it. Is now valuable PURELY in our reception to, and reproduction of, the aesthetic. [\u2026] \u2014 Reggie James (@HipCityReg) March 27, 2025\n\nGenerative AI has intentionally been molded to attack artists and diminish cultural literacy. Aidan Walker argues (read this whole piece if you liked my post):\n\nAI doesn\u2019t have to be an antagonist to schools, work, and civil society \u2014 they\u2019ve just designed and trained it that way\u2026 There could be guardrails in place, they could pay the producers of their training data, they could give the people a say in how the models are made and deployed \u2014 we could do a thousand things differently than the way they\u2019re being done now.\n\nGenerative AI \u2014 both imagery and text \u2014 is inextricable from the corporate vision for its use: a world in which workers are powerless and worthless, replaced by \u201cfree\u201d generated material. Corporate GenAI cannot be separated from the purpose for its use or the billionaires and billionaire-wannabes who shill for it. The Business Borg aesthetic imbues a sheen of venality.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nGenAI is Our Polyester by W.

It\u2019s not just more Luddism. Many people \u2014 though hardly all, given the popularity of AI products \u2014 sense that there is something grotesque about these simulacra, the people who push them on us, this whole affair. That aversion to the technological profane holds even when various stated objections to AI are supposedly addressed or nitpicked to death.\n\nSee also:\n\nWe need solidarity across creative industries", "label": "non_personal"}

For the first time, I was asked to have my picture taken by the Transportation Security Administration, or commonly known as the TSA. I'm not surprised that an airport such as San Francisco would have these implemented as ways of efficiently getting passengers as fast as possible.\n\nI politely told the TSA agent that I am declining facial recognition. The agent simply conducted a manual document check. It was a very easy experience and the TSA agent was very respectful.\n\nThe point here is that you're not required or obligated to have your picture taken for biometric verification in the United States. You can simply opt-out by requesting so at a point of entry, such as airport customs and of course with the TSA. Your identity document(s) is verified through a manual check.\n\nI wrote a post, Why I Opted-Out of Facial Recognition at Customs and Border Patrol on opting out of facial recognition by the United States Customs and Border Patrol and the experience I had.\n\nMany people don't know they can decline or aren't aware of the risks that facial recognition have in our society.

I'm a participant in the IndieWeb.\n\nWhat is the IndieWeb?\n\nThe IndieWeb is a people-focused alternative to the \u201ccorporate web\u201d. It is a community of independent and personal websites connected by open standards and based on the principles of: owning your domain and using it as your primary online identity, publishing on your own site first (optionally elsewhere), and owning your content.\n\nI am volunteering to host and organize the first IndieWebCamp Sacramento (IWC). It is a great way to bring together your local IndieWeb community and people from the greater IndieWeb community. As the pandemic changed how we interact, online meet-ups have kept the IndieWeb going. It would be nice to meet many of the familiar faces we've seen through the last few years in person!\n\nOrganizing and planning an IndieWebCamp in person involves various parts such as finding co-organizers, planning where to have the event, and the many aspects of event planning.\n\nI'm looking for a co-host or co-host. A co-host would be someone who could assist me in planning for a successful event. It can be someone local near Sacramento or someone who can assist remotely. Having a co-host would help in making the event come to fruition and have the event be successful.\n\nIWC Dates:\n\nThe new plan is to host it during the fall or winter when the weather starts cooling off!\n\nLate September\n\nOctober\n\nNovember\n\nDecember\n\nIf you or someone else is interested in helping plan IndieWebCamp Sacramento, I'd love to have you! Send me an email by clicking here.\n\nLet's have this last half of the year be full of fun events and one of those can be in Sacramento! If you are interested in attending, more information will be available soon!\n\nAnyone and everyone is welcome to participate in the IndieWeb.\n\nThis blog post has been posted on IndieNews", "label": "non_personal"}

Some of the quotes are \ud83d\udd25\n\n\u201cThe movement\u2026 represents in some sense a revolt against the hard mechanical conventional life and its insensibility to beauty (quite another thing to ornament). It is a protest against that so-called industrial progress which provides shoddy wares, the cheapness of which is paid for by the lives of their producers and the degradation of their users.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Walter Crane, The Revival of Design and Handicraft (orig. pg. 12)\n\nI found the layout of the text frustratingly uncomfortable to read. I read through page 145 (195 pages of content before endnotes).\n\nGraphics\n\nInteresting and wide-ranging collection of sample works included (chiefly black and white unfortunately) \u2014 though I was frustrated at least twice when a specific piece would be described in the text but not pictured.\n\nNotes and Quotes\n\nMartin Wiener \u2013 English Culture and the Decline of the Industrial Spirit\n\nDesign theory and categorization of ornament = related to industrialization of design\n\n\u201cThe Arts and Crafts movement was inspired by a crisis of conscience. Its motivations were social and moral, and its aesthetic values derived from the conviction that society produces the art and architecture it deserves.\u201d (from 1989 preface by Gillian Naylor)\n\n\u201cAverting mankind\u2019s enslavement to the machine by saving the mass product and the home from mechanical anarchy and by restoring them to purpose, sense and life.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Walter Gropius, The Scope of Total Architecture\n\ncontemporary critique from Thorstein Veblen 1899: idolizing the handmade \u2013> conspicuous consumption \u2014 \u201cpropaganda of crudity\u201d describing the \u201cexaltation of the defective\u201d aka imperfections in handwork (aestheticization!!!)\n\nthey don\u2019t write insults like this anymore lol: \u201cdisencumber yourselves of the lymphatic ideology of your deplorable Ruskin\u201d \u2013Marinetti, 1912\n\n1835 committee to figure out how to give craftspeople a design sense and *taste* since consumers preferred imported aesthetics\n\nRuskin thought a craft and its society were inextricable\n\n\u201cFor it is not the material, but the absence of human labor, which makes the thing worthless, and a piece of terracotta, or plaster of paris, which has been wrought by the human hand, is worth all the stone and Carrara cut by machinery. It is, indeed, possible and even usual, for men to sink into machines themselves, so that even handwork has all the character of mechanization.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Ruskin, \u2018The Lamp of Truth\u2019 from The Seven Lamps of Architecture\n\nThe Stones of Venice = key book to the movement \u2014 especially the essay \u201cNature of Gothic\u201d (here as printed by William Morris)\n\n\u201cIt is not that men are ill-fed, but that they have no pleasure in the work by which they make their bread, and therefore look to wealth as the only means of pleasure.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Ruskin, \u2018Nature of Gothic\u2019 from The Stones of Venice\n\nRuskin into destigmatizing manual labor\n\nsociety\u2019s wealth measured in human happiness and its works of art\n\nthis is grouping Burne-Jones in with Arts and Crafts rather than Pre-Raphaelite\n\n\u201cIt was just a commonplace thing handled imaginatively, and it gave me as much pleasure as anything in the exhibition.

These are some of the coolest dudes you guys will ever meet. It has been an interesting trip so far.\n\nWe left Nebraska on in the morning on Tuesday. When we got there we got some grub at a great place. Then we hit up downtown. We did a bit of shopping and just walked around. It was fun just being in that urban enviorment. All the buildings are beautiful. Downtown Denver has really cleaned up their act. I like seeing the street performers (the few in the winter).\n\nThen we hit up Redrocks Amphitheater and Park where we did some climbing up the stairs and enjoyed the beautiful sights and sceneries of the area. It was so relaxing. Any part of outside Denver is nice! I like nature. Twas fun. I do not think that I could live in the city\n\nWe had dinner at Five Guys, the burgers were so delicious. Where has it been my whole life. There were many places where we hit up for yummy food!\n\nThe nightlife in Denver is pretty swell!! The city surprises me so much!!!\n\nFound some good books at the Thrift Shop!! Who knew thrifts shops were so badass.\n\nWe went everywhere in Denver. The malls here are amazing and huge. So many sights we wanted to see but time was the enemy. The next trip will be even better.\n\nTime to hit the road! This was a trip that I really enjoyed especially with your buddies. Now it is time to go home and get back to reality. School starts soon and I got to get back to the whole routine.

It is the time where the most people are deep into their major. You know, the point where it seems too late to turn back. This is not the case for me.\n\nI've changed my major various times to in the last two years. It has not been the easiest process. In most cases it revolved around me jumping back and forth between different areas of science or healthcare related fields to humanities. Not deciding what I wanted in my life has had an effect on my greatly. Many friends know to what extent this led too. Thinking back on this tossing and turning made me realize how I truly did not have a passion for the sciences. You know what it really showed me? I am a person who is very stubborn. I was in denial. Deep down inside, there was no want for me to continue in the sciences. My mindset was not open to explore other options. I felt like a failure if I did not become something in the sciences or be something in healthcare. Avoiding disappointment and failure had become the way my life driving towards.\n\nThere comes a time where you have to wake up and come to reality that you really do not have interest in what you are shooting for after attempting various attempts. I should have followed my heart from the very beginning. My advice to you,\n\n\"\"Do not let anyone tell you what you should study. Only y0u know what you want in life.\"\"\n\nI did that mistake and did not follow my dreams right away. It took a lot of courage for me to stand up to myself. It is sort of shocking, huh? The mind is is your worst enemy. I am glad that I did what I did.\n\nNow I am following my passion. A passion that I have always known to have since the first time I took this class in high school. There is this a major sense of relief. I announce that I will fully commit to become a teacher and strive for what I feel that I will do best\n\nThank you for the support.\n\nWith much love,\n\nPablo Morales\n\n\"", "label": "non_personal"}
{"title": "Setting Up Vouch Proxy using Nginx", "url": "https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/setting-up-vouch-proxy-using-nginx", "content": "Setting Up Vouch Proxy using Nginx\n\nThis post was written in English (en_US).\n\nLocation: 38.581573, -121.494400\n\nBlog Post on this using Indieauth coming soon!\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIntroduction\n\nRecently I have started experimenting with identity. An SSO solution for Nginx using the auth_request module. Vouch Proxy can protect all of your websites at once.\n\nToday, I'll demonstrate how to setup Vouch Proxy on an nginx web server. In this example I will be using Google as our provider\n\nThis tutorial assumes you have prior knowledge of using a linux server such as Debian. Message me at hello@lifeofpablo.com if you need some help. I'd be happy to do so!\n\nWhat Vouch Proxy Does?\n\nAccording to the Repository README.md, it states the following:\n\nVouch Proxy (VP) forces visitors to login and authenticate with an IdP (such as one of the services listed above) before allowing them access to a website.\n\nVP can also be used as a Single Sign On (SSO) solution to protect all web applications in the same domain.\n\nAfter a visitor logs in Vouch Proxy allows access to the protected websites for several hours.

An SSO solution for Nginx using the auth_request module. Vouch Proxy can protect all of your websites at once.\n\nToday, I'll demonstrate how to setup Vouch Proxy on an nginx web server. In this example I will be using Google as our provider\n\nThis tutorial assumes you have prior knowledge of using a linux server such as Debian. Message me at hello@lifeofpablo.com if you need some help. I'd be happy to do so!\n\nWhat Vouch Proxy Does?\n\nAccording to the Repository README.md, it states the following:\n\nVouch Proxy (VP) forces visitors to login and authenticate with an IdP (such as one of the services listed above) before allowing them access to a website.\n\nVP can also be used as a Single Sign On (SSO) solution to protect all web applications in the same domain.\n\nAfter a visitor logs in Vouch Proxy allows access to the protected websites for several hours. Every request is checked by VP to ensure that it is valid.\n\nVP can send the visitor's email, name and other information which the IdP provides (including access tokens) to the web application as HTTP headers. VP can be used to replace application user management entirely.\n\nThings you'll need/prepare:\n\nA linux server with a public IP address with hosting and SSL Debian will be used here but any of the common distros will work Certbot is an easy solution to get SSL certifcate for https://\n\nGo Language (to compile vouch-proxy)\n\nVouch Proxy\n\nNginx Web Server Digital Ocean has a good guide if you need to learn how to setup virtual blocks in nginx.\n\n\n\nDownload/Install Vouch Proxy from Github\n\nMake sure to have Go Lang installed\n\n$ git clone https://github.com/vouch/vouch-proxy.git $ cd vouch-proxy $ ./do.sh goget $ ./do.sh build\n\nVouch Proxy Nginx Virtual Block\n\nLet's go ahead and create a virtual block to proxy Vouch Proxy.\n\nserver { server_name vouch.example.com; location / { proxy_set_header Host vouch.example.com; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https; proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9090; }\n\nLet's go ahead and create a virtual block for a regular nginx website site or edit an existing virtual block.

There is something so satisfying to write in different languages. Different parts of my brain activate and it works differently in each language. I also \"become a different\" person as each language influences how I present myself. I am still the same person but I tend to shift according to the target language.\n\nToday, I am going to say in a a video, \"Hello, I'm Pablo\" in three different languages, respectively: English, Spanish and French. I will also share some things about me in writing.\n\nI am really excited to make more visual content in the languages I know and the languages I am learning.

I've been a huge fan of BuzzFeed for many years for as long as I can remember. I remember stumbling on BuzzFeed's home page in the late 2000s. I've taken many of their quizzes posted on the site. There are other things on the site beyond the quizzes. I was very fortunate this week to visit BuzzFeed/Complex's office this week. I was very fortunate to get a tour and check things out! Going there was a whole experience. I got to share this experience with people I know an love. You know that feeling you get when you're a little kid at the grocery store eagerly waiting to see if my parents would buy me any candy. That's what I was feeling. I'm pretty sure I cried a few tears of joy. The office had such a cool color scheme and it went well with everything around it. It seemed very organized. I got to see how the office works and what the type of mood exists. The space was a welcoming right when you walk into. I would say it is a pretty laid back office.It was everything I hoped and dreamed for. I was in heaven.

My music taste has been less stale than when I had started.\n\nPosting on my blog\n\nI haven't posted as much on what I've been listening to. I decided to create weekly post of the titles and artist of respective I've listened to. If there is an album I really enjoyed, I will make a dedicated post.\n\nI built a microsite\n\nI created a microsite on a subdomain on lifeofpablo.com. This microsite will display all the albums I've listened to, so far. I will update as I go or I will update when I do my weekly post.\n\nThe website is https://1k.lifeofpablo.com.\n\nThe site is relatively simple. It has the following:\n\nNavigation Bar\n\nHero Image\n\nDescription\n\nAlbum Grid (Responsive of course :D )\n\nFooter\n\nI will organize it by the decade to keep things manageable. This is how it is organized in the book.\n\nIt's just plain simple.\n\nDocker and Github Actions\n\nI will update it using github actions along with Dockr to recreate the site when I make changes.\n\nRecomendations & Webmentions\n\nAs always, if any of you have any recommendations for music to listen to?

Anyone and everyone is welcome to participate in the carnival.\n\nWhat is self-care ?\n\n\"a multidimensional, multifaceted process of purposeful engagement in strategies that promote healthy functioning and enhance well-being.\" [1]\n\n\"Self-care means taking care of yourself so that you can be healthy, you can be well, you can do your job, you can help and care for others, and you can do all the things you need to and want to accomplish in a day.\" [2]\n\nThere is no one size fits all model for everyone. People's backgrounds such as culture, spiritual beliefs, life experiences, etc influence how self-care is practices. It could also be proactive or reactive. There is no right or wrong way of doing this.\n\nSelf-Care in the Digital Age\n\nWe live in age where we are always connected online. This also adds complexities balancing our lives. Setting boundaries isn't just limited to people. Being always connected to the web is also taxing on our mental health.\n\nHow Am I performing Self-Care ?\n\nLearning self-care has been something I've been working on a lot this year. It has been something I neglected for many, many years. It has helped me be more aligned and be more connected with myself. Finding a self-care routine isn't exactly a straight line to follow. I'm still finding ways to better improve my routine. It's been important to adjust as I go because it's a continious learning process. Some things worked a few months ago and now it isn't working as well before.\n\nSetting boundaries with myself and people\n\nActually find time for myself and appreciate alone time.\n\nActually address insecurities\n\nExcercise such as running or biking.\n\nDisconnect from digital devices as needed\n\nPicking up new hobbies such as hacky sack.\n\nI invite you to write a post on self-care.\n\nHere are some prompts to help you get started or to build off of this post.\n\nWhat type of self-care routines do partake in?\n\nWhat are some hard realizations once you started to take care of yourself?\n\nHow do you incorporate self-care in difficult times?\n\nWhat has been your journey in reaching self-care and your routines.\n\nHow does your self-care routine differ during the week vs the weekend/going on holiday?\n\nHow do you take care of yourself.\n\nDo you check in with yourself too make sure your self-care routine is keeping up with your needs?\n\nI will create a roundup post on the 1 November 2023 on all the responses I recieve.

It's not often I get time for myself other than at home. I either stay home or I go the usual places I'm comfortable going.\n\nI drove down to Simon's Cafe (Chinese Food Staple in Midtown Sacramento. As I was pulling up I remembered they closed down. I was sad. Then I remembered that there was a Thai restaurant a block or two down. Chicken Pad Thai was the meal of choice.\n\nThen, I went to went to happy hour at a Wine Bar across the street from the Thai restaraunt. I had a glass of Sangria. I don't mind a cheap drink during happy hour.\n\nAfter, I went to an art gallery to observe the art. I got to meet the artist of some of the art I admired. That was pretty tight!\n\nThen I came across to the Strapping Store location where ever I was in Midtown. I got some cool Sacramento themed items (last minute Christmas gifts). It's a pretty cool store.\n\nI ended the night with getting Frozen Yogurt. Strawberry Cheesecake Fro-yo and grahm crackers are amazing.\n\nIt was nice taking myself out. I don't do this often. This is something I wouldn't mind getting more comfortable with. It simply is trying to get out of my comfort zone. Overall, I enjoyed the alone time I had. Alone time is good.

Me gusta ir a los mercados de comida y probar todas las comidas deliciosas. Se nos hace agua en la boca.\n\nCelebraciones Mexicanas:\n\nEn mi familia nos gusta mucho cocinar en casa. Hacemos muchos platillos tradicionales. Hacemos tamales de varios sabores, ponche mexicano, mole, pasteles, cocteles de camar\u00f3n, y much\u00edsimo m\u00e1s! No hay l\u00edmite. En este mes, normalmente no comemos en la calle. \u00a1La comida en casa siempre es m\u00e1s rica!\n\nEn las noches siempre vemos unas pel\u00edculas de navidad.

Podemos re\u00edr entre todos.\n\nSiempre ponemos y arreglamos el \u00e1rbol de navidad. Nosotros abrimos los regalos en la noche del 24 de diciembre. Siempre ha sido as\u00ed.\n\nCelebraciones Estadounidenses:\n\nSiempre me reuno con mis amigos. Ahora que no vivimos en la misma regi\u00f3n, es muy importante estar juntos. Hablamos como nos fue este a\u00f1o y que queremos cumplir para el a\u00f1o entrante. Algunas cosas que hacemos son casas de jengibres y tenemos una fiesta. Dependiendo como est\u00e9 el clima, andamos en patineta o vamos al skatepark.\n\nLo que siempre me anima es la noche de programaci\u00f3n. Hacemos un plan en que vamos a programar en una noche.

I would consider them close friends. We've kept this friendship even if they are across the world.\n\nAs a person, I would say I\u2019m a very affectionate person.

I\u2019m very affectionate to those with whom I have a close relationship, such as my best friends. I would also consider them very affectionate as well.

Or you go into System Preferences and do it.\n\nNow you can stop reading. But if you\u2019re weird and want to set it programatically on macOS, here\u2019s a hacky way to do it using Nix-Darwin.\n\nIt uses defaultbrowser, which is a teeny little CLI tool that calls the relevant Objective-C functions.\n\nIf you run defaultbrowser without an argument, it shows you what browsers you have installed. You then pass one of those browser identifier strings to it as an argument.\n\nSome options for known browsers: safari , chrome , firefox , librewolf , torbrowser .\n\nNow let\u2019s put it in a Nix-Darwin setup.\n\nlet vars = { # ... defaultbrowser = \"librewolf\"; }; in # ... your nix-darwin setup\n\ndefaultbrowser needs to be installed as a system package, so let\u2019s add it to environment.systemPackages\n\nenvironment.systemPackages = import ./modules/packages.nix pkgs ++ (if (vars ? \"defaultbrowser\" && builtins.isString vars.defaultbrowser) then [ pkgs.defaultbrowser ] else [ ]);\n\nNow we need an activation script that\u2019ll run it every time you run your Nix setup (which will be relatively often).\n\nsystem.activationScripts = (if (vars ? \"defaultbrowser\" && builtins.isString vars.defaultbrowser) then { postUserActivation.text = \"defaultbrowser ${vars.defaultbrowser}\"; } else { });\n\ndefaultbrowser is clever enough that if you tell it to set your default browser to one that already is your default browser, it\u2019ll just print a nice message to the screen like:\n\nlibrewolf is already set as the default HTTP handler\n\nI thought about adding the variable to the list of packages (or Homebrew Casks, or Mac App Store apps) that need installing, but there\u2019s a mismatch between the browser identifier string and the package name used by nixpkgs and/or Homebrew. Plus if you\u2019re using Safari, there\u2019s kind of no way to not install it. So you need to make sure you\u2019ve installed the browser, and check the browser identifier string with defaultbrowser .", "label": "non_personal"}

{"title": "Generative AI as a magic system \u2013 Tracy Durnell's Mind Garden", "url": "https://tracydurnell.com/2025/06/24/generative-ai-as-a-magic-system/", "content": "We treat generative AI like magic\u2026 and magic systems have rules. When creating fantasy worlds, writers think about who can use magic, how magic is performed, what it\u2019s able to do, what its constraints are, what the source of magic is, and what it costs. I\u2019m applying a bit of reverse worldbuilding to the real world to extrapolate the rules of the AI magic system.\n\nIslands in the Sky by Death Valley Girls\n\nWho can use AI magic: magic users pay to use corporate AI magic systems. Those who are wealthy and tech savvy enough can host their own local model. Free magic use is mostly limited to corporate largesse ultimately intended to build magic dependency.\n\nHow AI magic is cast: AI spells are cast with written text input through a digital interface. Spells are refined and recast until the outcome satisfies (spells produce different results every time they are cast).\n\nWhat AI magic can do: AI spells can produce combinations of words that are interpreted as writing, code-like material that sometimes runs as code, images that resemble art, and video that resembles reality. It can create imitations of specific human creators\u2019 work, as well as individual\u2019s speech and appearance. It can also mimic human conversation for a span of time before the spell dissipates. AI magic is near instantaneous, allowing people without technical skills to produce text and graphics faster than writers and artisans.\n\nWhat AI magic cannot do: AI magic cannot produce the same outcome twice, nor act upon existing conjurations, instead casting spells anew each time. AI magic itself cannot reference sources, though may be used in tandem with other tools that enable citation (though with questionable accuracy). AI magic cannot reason or write, but its conjurations may create the illusion of intelligence through their statistical consistency with written language use.\n\nThe source of AI magic: AI magic derives from statistical analysis of human-created art, writing, speech, music, and video, classified and sorted by human laborers in low-cost geos.\n\nThe cost of AI magic: Resource costs of AI magic include power, water, and high-end chips, which themselves require specialized manufacturing and rare earth minerals.\n\nSocial costs include the reinforcement of racism and sexism, as well as mental harm to AI trainers assessing inputs to the magic system.\n\nSocietal costs include job elimination and job intensification as positions able to be reproduced in part by magic are eliminated and that magic work is shifted to the remaining workers.\n\nInformation costs include the destruction of the online publishing incentive structure / information commons, leading to more paywalled content; an increase in low-quality material, which makes finding accurate information harder; as well as the danger of political propaganda by poisoned magic systems.\n\nIndividual user costs include critical thinking skills, writing abilities, and patience for conversing with humans.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nThe new magic of AI vs. the old magic of artists by Kening Zhu\n\nSee also:\n\nGenerative AI and the Business Borg aesthetic", "label": "non_personal"}

Stowing your carry-on wasn\u2019t a competitive sport back in the day.).\n\nThe aesthetics of generative AI\n\n\u201cI have become momentarily obsessed with scrolling down the homepage of the MetaAI tool and seeing the infinite feed of what people have been asking of The Machine. The outputs are horribly banal, but the requests are a weird window into THE (NORMIE) HUMAN SOUL AND ITS DESIRES: www.meta.ai\u201d\n\n\u2014 Matt Muir, May 6, 2025 at 8:51 AM\n\n(via)\n\nBy its nature, generative AI produces the most likely image that meets the brief, which devolves to insipid Pictionary-style visual communication: chonky = cat, kebab = food = French chef\u2019s hat. These graphics are iconographic pablum, the uninspired result of gee-whiz curiosity about a new \u201ctool\u201d (toy)(trap) in an environment that discourages personal taste and cultural literacy.\n\nOriginally, I wrote up why I find these particular graphics tacky and visually uninteresting, but realized that ultimately, what they look like doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 it\u2019s the beliefs beneath the appearance that matter. As corporate models are trained further, Generative AI will probably continue to get better, rendering more attractive and/or plausible outputs, but it won\u2019t matter to me how good it gets because I reject the values it represents.\n\n(NB: I don\u2019t want you to feel bad about yourself if you use generative AI, because there are myriad reasons to have experimented with it, including being forced to for your employment; I want you to recognize what it symbolizes when you enthusiastically use this technology today, and make an informed choice about whether those are values you wish to signal to others.)\n\n\u201cWhat is wrong with a counterfeit is not what it is like, but how it was made.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Harry G. Frankfurt, On Bullshit\n\nAesthetics are looks that signal values\n\nWitching Hour by Ladytron\n\nAn aesthetic is an expression of taste for shared values, commonly communicated through a distinct style. We think of aesthetics as surface appearance only, but the formation of an aesthetic\u2019s conventions reflects the why and the how underneath the what. Just as the medium of a thing carries a message, so does its aesthetic. Aesthetics are visually and verbally encoded value systems.\n\nIdeology is a value system, independent of appearances. Aesthetics are the appearance of an ideology, which grow from its values. Subcultures form around ideologies, with members signaling their participation through aesthetics. \u201cGood taste\u201d is aesthetics that express those values.\n\nThough it\u2019s now often reduced to a visual style, the Arts and Crafts movement of the late 1800s and early 1900s was cross-disciplinary and united instead by an ethos \u2014 namely, the nobility of craftsmanship*:\n\n\u201cFor it is not the material, but the absence of human labor, which makes the thing worthless, and a piece of terracotta, or plaster of paris, which has been wrought by the human hand, is worth all the stone and Carrara cut by machinery.\u201d \u2014 John Ruskin, The Lamp of Truth from The Seven Lamps of Architecture\n\nAccording to the Arts and Crafts aesthetic, what is made should signal how it is made \u2014 the aesthetic\u2019s value system weights how something is made to be as important, if not more, as what is made. Surface appearance is borne of the decisions this taste for craft produces.\n\n*(People might instead think of this William Morris quote as the quintessential perspective of Arts and Crafts \u2014 \u201cHave nothing in your house that you do not know to be useful, or believe to be beautiful.\u201d \u2014 and I suspect there\u2019s a reason we\u2019ve been taught to recall a philosophy centered on material possession instead of labor.)\n\nLooking at a Kelmscott Press book (William Morris\u2019 printing company) reveals the printer\u2019s respect for handicraft: they designed custom drop letters and frames, included original illustrations by fine artists like Edward Burne-Jones, used original type modeled after typefaces used by printers like Aldus Manutius in the early days of the printing press, printed with a richer black ink than was standard at the time, and employed a heavy hand in letterpress printing so the design and type would be impressed into the page. Thoughtful, intentional ornamentation is embraced. The artifact itself is a thing to be appreciated as much as its contents; these are books that honor the integrity of all creative workers involved in their production.\n\nEmily Amick applies this analytical lens to reveal the tradwife aesthetic\u2019s underlying values:\n\nPrairie-core. Domestic bliss. Big sleeves. Bigger sourdough starters. And beneath it all, the subtle (or not-so-subtle) message: a woman\u2019s place is in the kitchen. But not because she wants to be there, because that\u2019s where God or her husband or some TikTok algorithm put her. The tradwife aesthetic promises comfort, but it delivers control. It\u2019s softness as a strategy. It\u2019s anti-feminism with a floral filter. It\u2019s nostalgia for a time when women were property, romanticized by influencers who want brand deals from butter. [\u2026] The tradwife says: give up your autonomy and someone else will take care of everything.\n\nWe adopt aesthetics based on aspirational values\n\nJessica Cullen writes that (emphasis mine): \u201cAesthetics aren\u2019t always about who we currently are but rather who we want to be.\u201d People adopt an aesthetic to say something about themselves to others. We intentionally adopt a particular subculture\u2019s aesthetics to convey our belonging and raise our status within the subculture. As Alec Leach puts it, \u201ca lot of the modern taste economy is actually the status economy.\u201d\n\nSometimes, we perceive only the surface level of an aesthetic, its appearance without the values \u2014 as Amick notes, the tradwife aesthetic \u201clooks so damn pretty and nourishing. And we are tired.\u201d \u2014 but whenever we adopt an aesthetic, we endorse (intentionally or not) the underlying values it represents. Amick continues dissecting the tradwife aesthetic and how it serves as conservative propaganda:\n\nWhat looks like innocent lifestyle content is actually part of an organized political movement designed to make patriarchy look cozy and appealing. Because politics is downstream from culture. The vibes that influence how we act and live.\n\nAesthetics matter more than ever because we act in accordance with our chosen aesthetics. As we get more and more of our \u201ccultural\u201d content on corporate silos, politics and purchases have subsumed a lot of cultural tastemaking. In this TikTok, Jamelle Bouie describes how politicians use aesthetic signaling to appeal to voters. Richard Sennett identifies that politicians come to embody \u201cintentions, desires, values, beliefs, tastes \u2013 an emphasis which has again the effect of divorcing power from responsibility.\u201d\n\nAnu Atluru argues that \u201cAesthetics are the modern units of cultural currency\u2014stores of value and instruments of power, capable of appreciating and being monetized at scale. Owning an aesthetic is owning influence.\u201d (emphasis mine)\n\nInterrogating the Business Borg aesthetic\n\nGlass Lux by Glass Lux\n\nThe Arts and Craft movement\u2019s respect for labor inspired stylistic choices that highlighted craftwork as well as the decisions in what goods to produce and how. So how does the Business Borg aesthetic reveal its values?\n\nTo define the Business Borg aesthetic, I\u2019m looking at:\n\nthe values I see expressed through generative media,\n\nI see expressed through generative media, the actions of the corporations behind generative AI,\n\nof the corporations behind generative AI, who buys into generative AI, and\n\nbuys into generative AI, and what else they like that reflects the same underlying values.\n\nWhat genAI is better at than a human artist is being cheap and instant.\n\nThe Business Borg aesthetic uses technology to signal wealth and power. Generative AI is not the only visual expression of the Business Borg aesthetic, just its most recognizable. The aesthetic is also signified visually by CGI-heavy blockbuster franchises, NFT art, and the Cybertruck; and in text by LinkedIn corporate thirst traps, X braggadocio, SEO word vomit, and generated \u201canswers\u201d to search results.\n\nAs political bedpartners, there is overlap between the Business Borg aesthetic and the MAGA aesthetic, but they\u2019re distinct viewpoints. Both share dominance as a core value, decry empathy, center patriarchy, and admire performance \u2014 but MAGA also signals Judeo-Christian morality, traditional beauty standards / traditional gender roles, hyper masculinity / violence, and nationalism. MAGA borrows aesthetics from golden pasts, like Neo-Classical architecture, tradwives, and, as Kate Wagner brands it, Regional Car Dealership Rococo; Business Borg prefer the more modern tones of cyberpunk, solarpunk, and minimalism. Business Borg are regulatory libertarians who envision themselves as the rightful leaders of society, Kings of techno-city-states; MAGA are Christian nationalists who want to use the power of the state to impose their beliefs on others.\n\nElon is a Business Borg at heart but wielded a chainsaw to appeal to the more violent MAGA aesthetic. Zuckerberg is a Business Borg but got a MAGA makeover with masculine stubble and bling.\n\nWhy am I naming this after the Borg? Like Star Trek\u2019s Borg, this is an aesthetic rooted in extractive consumption, assimilationist dominance, neo-colonial expansionism, self-righteous conviction, reductionist thinking, and proclamations of inevitability. It idolizes technology, often inspired by older science-fiction, and draws on cyberpunk aesthetics. The Silicon Valley Collective values groupthink and believes themselves superior to \u201cthe other.\u201d\n\nWho embraces this aesthetic\n\nNot all users of Generative AI embrace the Business Borg aesthetic. I think a lot of people are experimenting with generative AI out of neophilic curiosity, productivity imperatives, nihilistic determinism, and corporate fiat. Aspiring billionaires adopt the Business Borg aesthetic to signal their belonging in the cohort of the techno-rich.\n\nGenAI evangelists seem to be the same type of person who was into passive income and supplements fifteen years ago, then Soylent and SEO ten years ago, then NFTs and macro diets five years ago, now genAI and X blue checks.\n\nThe Business Borg aesthetic combines tech-centered neophilia, a hustle mindset, an obsession with optimization, evangelical fervor, and fake-it-till-you-make-it showmanship.\n\nThe Elon fanclub are Business Borg. Ed Zitron\u2019s Business Idiot shares a lot of characteristics with Business Borg (and may even be the same group, but I think feels a little different?).\n\nThe subculture emphasizes high profile demonstrations of \u201cwinning\u201c \u2014 using a $10k NFT as their X profile pic, bragging about SEO heists ripping off a competitor, generosity stunts a la Mr Beast, rubbing it in Miyazaki\u2019s face that there will be thousands of shitty knockoffs vaguely reminiscent of his work across the web.\n\nBusiness Borg signal their busyness \u2014 and importance \u2014 by broadcasting how little they sleep, how much they work, and how little they read. The only fiction they like is (old) sci-fi because they read it as non-fiction, not fiction \u2014 a source of \u201cinspiration\u201d stripped of context and commentary. Using GenAI signals their adoption of cutting edge technology, the synthetic smoothness emphasizing its nonhuman origin. They care a lot about IQ, a supposedly impartial measure of intelligence that rewards their backgrounds and thinking styles, and idolize \u201cgenius.\u201d They\u2019re not actually neurodivergent, but play on stereotypes of autistic savants to cover for their pathological greed and lack of empathy.\n\nTheir visual and linguistic taste is mid because taste is not valued in the Business Borg aesthetic. In fact, there\u2019s a certain pride in prompting things without having any skill, an almost gleeful snub to the perceived cultural gatekeepers \u2014 artists and writers and other creative workers \u2014 whose opinions the Business Borg disrespect because they believe that authority derives from money, not knowledge. They believe artists have wasted their time learning skills and developing taste. Academics have wasted their time studying things when information is just a click away. Business Borg don\u2019t care about anything besides making money, and don\u2019t care much how they spend it because the point is to have it, and show off that they have it.\n\nInto The Water by Ritual Howls\n\nGenAI True Believers often resemble the CEOs at the head of tech companies: wealthy, male, and white. These are also the people who are least at threat from the widespread use of generative AI, which reinforces racial and gender stereotypes and purports neutrality while serving up right-wing biases and corporate and foreign propaganda. Audrey Watters points out:\n\n\u201cComputing (in general and ed-tech specifically) has long been the bastion of white male privilege; and while there had been efforts to change that \u2013 in pipelines and on panels and whatnot \u2013 AI is clearly a re-entrenchment of that power, explicitly so with the Trump Administration\u2019s dismantling of civil rights protections, echoed by the tech industry\u2019s dismantling of its own DEI initiatives.\u201d\n\nAnil Dash describes \u201cAI-first\u201d as this year\u2019s \u201cReturn to Office.\u201d Managers didn\u2019t care about in-office culture until it was made clear that workers could carry on just fine without them; managers care about AI only insomuch as it permits controlling \u2014 and firing \u2014 workers.\n\nWhat the Business Borg aesthetic represents is more important than its appearance; it represents the dominance of ordinal thinking and the ability of moneyed power to do as it wishes without regard to law or morality \u2014 in short, the hierarchical worldview that some people are better than others and that their preferences trump their lesser\u2019s needs.\n\n\u201cWe will add your biological and technological distinctiveness to our own. Your culture will adapt to service us. Resistance is futile.\u201d \u2014 the Borg\n\nValues driving the Business Borg aesthetic\n\nTeri Kanefield breaks down Leor Zmigrod\u2019s book on ideology, explaining that \u201cAll ideologies seek a utopia.\u201d The Business Borg utopia puts billionaires and their ilk high atop society, in control via the technology they own.\n\nCore values I see uniting the Business Borg aesthetic are:\n\nonly the output matters efficiency is king quantity over quality appearance trumps reality \u201cprogress\u201d cannot be stopped\n\nValue: Only the output matters\n\nGenerative AI is being marketed to businesses as a low-cost replacement for workers that cuts steps \u2014 and collaboration \u2014 out of the process. This is a box-checking culture; all that matters is that an email was sent, a presentation was created, the newspaper had a summer reading insert, no matter the books on it were imaginary.\n\nFoundational beliefs\n\nprocess does not add value and wastes time\n\nthe world is reducible to data , and every question has one objectively correct answer\n\n, and every question has communication and collaboration are a waste of time (\u201cemail jobs\u201d)\n\n(\u201cemail jobs\u201d) experience is irrelevant\n\nOutcome: Tech reduces the complex to input and output\n\nIn contrast with the Arts and Crafts movement, the Business Borg aesthetic actively conceals human labor and venerates the wisdom of the machine. Generative text and graphics simulate a performance of human-less \u2014 cost-less \u2014 automation. Generative answers encourage a reliance on the machine to synthesize on one\u2019s behalf \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t matter to search engines that the \u201canswers\u201d their AI has provided cite sources incorrectly.\n\nHumans are perceived as sources of inefficiency under the Business Borg ideology, because they must be compensated in accordance with their skills and how much time they spend working. Generating material is rooted in devaluing both skill and process. The invented summer reading list was the result of forcing a single contractor to prepare an impossible quantity of work; generating content was the only way for the poor bloke to produce the content on budget. No one reviewed it, because Business Borg only care that the product exists.\n\nEd Zitron describes the evolution of the Business Idiot, personified by middle managers who are completely dissociated from the product they\u2019re selling and explicitly do not do work (emphasis mine):\n\n[Business Idiots] see every part of our lives as a series of inputs and outputs. They boast about how many books they\u2019ve read rather than the content of said books, about how many hours they work (even though they never, ever work that many), about high level they are in a video game they clearly don\u2019t play, about the money they\u2019ve raised and the scale they\u2019ve raised it at, and about how expensive and fancy their kitchen gadgets are. Everything is dominance, acquisition, growth and possession over any lived experience, because their world is one where the journey doesn\u2019t matter, because their journeys are riddled with privilege and the persecution of others in the pursuit of success. These people don\u2019t want to automate work, they want to automate existence. They fantasize about hitting a button and something happening, because experiencing \u2014 living! \u2014 is beneath them, or at least your lives and your wants and your joy are.\n\nValue: Efficiency is king\n\nGenerative AI produces endless content for low cost. Corporations are using Generative AI as an excuse to lay off workers and intensify the jobs of those remaining.\n\nReady Aim Fire (Owl Vision Remix) [Single] by Blue Stahli\n\nFoundational beliefs\n\nthe more mechanized a process is, the more efficient it becomes because humans are naturally inefficient\n\nOutcome: GenAI performs \u201cefficiency\u201d\n\nGenerative AI need not actually reduce work or cost to represent efficiency when mechanization is always favored over people. The Business Borg aesthetic perceives automation as efficient \u2014 hence situations where workers are paid to simulate chatbots simulating human agents on customer service platforms, Microsoft devs handhold Copilot, and GM\u2019s Cruise \u201cautonomous\u201d taxis needed remote human intervention every 4-5 miles!!!\n\nEfficiency is a code word for shareholders, just like \u201ccost-cutting,\u201d who know that these phrases mean putting the boot on workers\u2019 necks for short-term profits. This efficiency aesthetic is used to justify outrageously profitable companies continuing to slash workers *cough Microsoft* It plays out as Hollywood demolishing the screenwriter profession to save a buck on writing rooms and self-cannibalizing the development of future acting talent by forcing extras to be body scanned so they can be reproduced by AI.\n\nJeremy comments on the use of genAI in coding, noting that it\u2019s justified by claims like \u201cworking code wins\u201d \u2014 as in, what it looks like under the hood and how it\u2019s constructed don\u2019t matter. I\u2019m not a coder, but I\u2019ve seen enough HTML produced by PageMaker and other CMSs to be skeptical of the quality of any generated code \u2014 is genAI producing the coding equivalent of tables for web layout? \ud83e\udd14 The Business Borg aesthetic accepts mediocrity without understanding; easy and fast is always best. Good enough is always good enough.\n\nValue: Quantity over quality\n\nGenerative AI is billed as a good-enough tool that will speed up production. Cory Doctorow writes of the managerial push to automate with AI:\n\nThe point of using automation to weaken labor isn\u2019t just cheaper products \u2013 it\u2019s cheaper, defective products, inflicted on the unsuspecting and defenseless public who are no longer protected by workers\u2019 professionalism and pride in their jobs.\n\nEnormous by LLgL TNDR\n\nFoundational beliefs\n\nprofit today trumps tomorrow\u2019s concerns \u2014 someone else will have to fix \u2018that problem\u2019\n\n\u2014 someone else will have to fix \u2018that problem\u2019 money is authority \u2014 individual rankings can be quantified by wealth\n\n\u2014 individual rankings can be quantified by wealth anything that cannot be quantified is not important\n\nOutcome: Algorithms produce culture-like media, not culture\n\nGenAI and corporate web algorithms are intended to absorb attention like black absorbs light; they are designed to maximize engagement at minimal cost. Spotify benefits from degradation of culture. Netflix is a chum machine, built to spew content that people watch in the background. Kyle Raymond Fitzpatrick laments that \u201cSo much of culture is edgeless and soft, intended for us to astroglide through it without any friction or doubt as we half-watch in 1.5x speed, to consume as if we really are incapable of critical thoughts, all to appeal to everyone and no one at the same time.\u201d Internet Age capitalism produces entertainment that is culture-like, writes Nicholas Carr:\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really being tested here is human taste. Will we accept a simulacrum of a work of art or craft as a satisfactory substitute for the real thing?\u201d\n\nSo long as people accept cheap low-quality cultural media, businesses have little incentive to pay for higher quality. Generative AI becomes an attack on culture because it drowns out human-made art and writing so it\u2019s impossible to find amidst the Great Social Media Garbage Patch. Aidan Walker describes all this as \u2018 slop capitalism \u2018: \u201can economic and cultural system in which the primary product is slop and the primary activity is the destruction of value rather than its creation.\u201d\n\nValue: Appearances trump reality\n\nGenerative AI produces plausible graphics that we interpret as real-adjacent and plausible combinations of text that we interpret as communication.\n\nFoundational Beliefs\n\nperformance of dominance builds and reinforces real power\n\nOutcome: GenAI supersedes reality with performance and symbolism\n\nThe Business Borg aesthetic celebrates audacious performances of infinite wealth and indefinite power: adopters and evangelists for genAI also embrace filling streets with \u201cself-driving\u201d cars over the protests of residents and first responders, raining space debris onto inhabited areas from slapdash rocket ships, paying a fortune for a banana taped to a wall as conceptual art and eating it, paying women to have their IVF babies so they can seem fertile without fucking. While the culture at large has shifted towards inconspicuous consumption, luxury that requires knowledge to see, Business Borg signal their wealth blatantly.\n\nA repeating theme of the Business Borg aesthetic is replacing reality with life-like hyperreality: the simulation of conversation and connection with chatbots, the renderings of war and disaster mimicking photojournalism to push political narratives, the \u201cresurrected\u201d extinct species, the green screen action sequences that don\u2019t track. A photograph of reality may seem less real than a generated image if it does not abide by our expectations. (See also: reading \u201chuman vibes\u201d into LLM responses)\n\nLook at the snoozefest kayfabe of modern MMA: it\u2019s as much about the smack talk at weigh-ins as the fights themselves, athletes winning by points for \u201ccontrolling the octagon\u201d instead of fighting to win by KO or submission \u2014 look no further than that embarrassment of a so-called fight between Mike Tyson and the YouTuber, who danced around an old man till he got tired so he could win by decision and say he\u2019d beaten a legend \ud83d\ude34\n\nEffective altruism performs charity that can never be disproven, despite its claims of data-driven decisions, because it pretends to think at such long-term scales that known, existing suffering pales in comparison to the imagined future suffering they claim to be protecting against. It cosplays rationalism. Wannabe Foundation shit.\n\nThe Business Borg aesthetic is expressed as cheap cruft disguised as something of substance: words that look like writing, but are not; images that look like art, but are not; fights that look fighting, but are not.\n\nAs Ed Zitron sums up, it\u2019s a \u201csymbolic economy:\u201d\n\nThe sweeping changes we\u2019ve seen, both in our economy and in our society, has led to an unprecedented, gilded age of bullshit where nothing matters, and things \u2014 things of actual substance \u2014 matter nothing.\n\nTraditionally, we have been wary of those wearing a mask, explains Dan Fox in Pretentiousness, suspecting they are something other than what they present themselves as \u2014 but authenticity has faded as a cultural value. Business Borg embrace performance as more true than reality; what someone wants to be is more important than what they are now. What a technology could be is more important than what it currently is.\n\nValue: \u201cProgress\u201d cannot be stopped\n\nThe rapacious assimilation of copyrighted material to train models, the dismissal of AI\u2019s environmental cost and induced demand, and PR campaign reorienting the conversation around AI to its possible future harms as a distraction from the harms happening today all build from the same foundation: theoretically, scaling towards the pursuit of AGI \u2014 but more likely securing the funding to inextricably embed AI into our society and infrastructure.\n\nFoundational Beliefs\n\ntechnology always represents progress\n\nthe ends justify the means\n\nOutcome: GenAI is full speed ahead, no matter what\n\nAdvocates of generative AI are pursuing a brute force, fear-mongering approach to deregulation and preventing regulation. They are defying legality in obtaining training data while declaring the technology a fait accompli: resistance is futile. Their web crawlers ignore robots.txt, breaking the common courtesy of the web. They dismiss complaints about bias, claiming that they can fix that in the future. (And what incentive will there be to ever go back and fix it, once we can\u2019t avoid using it?) They\u2019re hoping enough of us will get hooked on it \u2014 and government and corporations will integrate enough of it too deeply in their processes \u2014 to allow their legally-suspect models to be shut down.\n\nRyan Broderick observes:\n\nWhat the AI arms race has actually done is codified and automated all of the failures of the previous internet era. Extremism, misinformation, harassment, non-consensual sexual material, and scams \u2014 all the content that tech companies promised to fix, but never could at scale \u2014 are now trapped in some AI\u2019s black box of data.\n\nAGI, which has been \u201cthree to five years away\u201d for years, is a Bezzle. As Cory Doctorow quotes JK Gabraith, a Bezzle is \u201cthe magic interval when a confidence trickster knows he has the money he has appropriated but the victim does not yet understand that he has lost it.\u201d John Kay expands that \u201cThe joy of the bezzle is that two people \u2013 each ignorant of the other\u2019s existence and role \u2013 can enjoy the same wealth.\u201d\n\nScams and pyramid schemes are seductive to Business Borg, like Elizabeth Holmes and Sam Bankman-Fried, because the only things they value are money and power, not making things that actually work (see: Cybertrucks falling apart, SpaceX rockets exploding); the trick is not to get caught. The goal is to surf the edge of profit as long as possible.\n\nRight now the whole stock market is bloated by outrageous NVIDIA, Google, Microsoft and Meta valuations based on the potential of generative AI to create a new \u201cessential\u201d utility, a service that everyone will need to subscribe to, forever \u2014 and so many people have bought into the grift so hard they\u2019ll do anything they can to make it a success, or at least rake in the cash for as long as they can. Then when the bubble pops, the corporations will get bailed out on the taxpayer dollar, while we workers resign ourselves to working until we die since we\u2019ve privatized retirement \ud83d\ude43\n\nGenAI is being deployed to control\n\nArtists are under attack, culturally and economically, so it is only fair that they point out the quintessential thing that artists offer that generative AI cannot: taste. Professional (and amateur) artists have devoted a great deal of time to developing their taste. The oligarchs who run Silicon Valley are steeped in their own rightness and devalue anything that isn\u2019t their expertise; if they don\u2019t know about it, it must not be important. To the Business Borg, taste is not an essential component of production.\n\nMandy Brown describes how genAI is used to undercut expertise (emphasis mine):\n\nIt\u2019s instructive that one of the mechanisms for perpetuating this ideology are chattering bots that speak both fact and falsehood in the same servile and confident tone, their makers unconcerned with the difference. In fact, their makers seem entirely concerned with obviating that difference, with disappearing distinctions between knowledge and ignorance, without which truth becomes entirely a product of power. [\u2026] [I]f those in power cannot prove that a great many people are already inferior then they will bring that inferiority about by forcing them to use a tool that diminishes their intellectual and creative capacity.\n\nBusiness Borg like generative AI because it grants them cultural power that they have not been able to dominate on their own. They lack skill, so they devalue skill. They need content, so they make an infinite content machine and conscript users as unwitting factory workers to provide free labor. The relentless promotion of GenAI is an attempt by corporations to capture cultural value by siphoning off value from human-made aesthetics. Generative AI is billionaires punching down on artists and the working class.\n\n[\u2026] I think Miyazaki\u2019s style is still valuable But it is now, in a day, valuable in a different way. What was once valuable in the awareness of painstaking labor, beautiful stories, and coherent aesthetic across the previous two qualities. PLUS our reception to it. Is now valuable PURELY in our reception to, and reproduction of, the aesthetic. [\u2026] \u2014 Reggie James (@HipCityReg) March 27, 2025\n\nGenerative AI has intentionally been molded to attack artists and diminish cultural literacy. Aidan Walker argues (read this whole piece if you liked my post):\n\nAI doesn\u2019t have to be an antagonist to schools, work, and civil society \u2014 they\u2019ve just designed and trained it that way\u2026 There could be guardrails in place, they could pay the producers of their training data, they could give the people a say in how the models are made and deployed \u2014 we could do a thousand things differently than the way they\u2019re being done now.\n\nGenerative AI \u2014 both imagery and text \u2014 is inextricable from the corporate vision for its use: a world in which workers are powerless and worthless, replaced by \u201cfree\u201d generated material. Corporate GenAI cannot be separated from the purpose for its use or the billionaires and billionaire-wannabes who shill for it. The Business Borg aesthetic imbues a sheen of venality.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nGenAI is Our Polyester by W.

That aversion to the technological profane holds even when various stated objections to AI are supposedly addressed or nitpicked to death.\n\nSee also:\n\nWe need solidarity across creative industries", "label": "non_personal"}

It\u2019s a sharecropping system, but the sharecroppers are generally happy because their interest lies in self-expression or socializing, not in making money, and, besides, the economic value of each of their individual contributions is trivial. It\u2019s only by aggregating those contributions on a massive scale \u2013 on a web scale \u2013 that the business becomes lucrative. To put it a different way, the sharecroppers operate happily in an attention economy while their overseers operate happily in a cash economy.\n\nI encountered this (old) analogy for social media platforms as digital sharecropping and thought it also fit generative AI. Generative AI companies steal our intellectual property then license it back to us. We can\u2019t be compensated reasonably for our individual contributions to the model because they\u2019ve stolen from so many of us and each individual\u2019s work represents a miniscule portion of the entire model. Whatever we generate with their models can\u2019t be copyrighted and used to make money for *us* without significant human contributions \u2014 but generated works are in direct competition with the creators whose works built the model. These powerful, well-funded companies want businesses to fire their employees and pay them instead, making businesses reliant on an opaque, unpredictable service that demands vast amounts of natural resources that may be in short \u2014 and shortening \u2014 supply.\n\nBut unlike social media, which rewards users emotionally rather than financially for their labor, creators aren\u2019t getting anything out of having our work used to train generative AI models. And so we\u2019re fighting back earlier in the cycle than with social media \u2014 maybe before it can become entrenched.

Fair warning, this is a 5000 word post; I\u2019ve been working on this for weeks, pulling together what I\u2019ve learned about generative AI and culture over the past two years, so I hope it is worth your time \ud83d\ude04 Bonus: it doubles as a playlist \ud83c\udfb6\n\n\u201c\u2018Real power\u2019 is achieved when a technology \u2018[leaves] mythology and [enters] banality,'\u201d Marion Fourcade and Kieran Healy quote Vincent Mosco in The Ordinal Society. We\u2019ve had the mythology stage \u2014 the world tour with grandiose prophecies of imminent AGI \u2014 but now the race to normalize generative AI* is on: tech corporations are attempting to inure people to generative AI, an expression of the Business Borg aesthetic that currently carries a negative stigma outside of tech.\n\n*(My rule of thumb: if something is described as AI, it\u2019s probably predatory and/or bullshit; if it\u2019s described as machine learning, it probably does something useful. Not always true but a helpful predictor.)\n\nIn general, people like what we recognize better than what we don\u2019t \u2014 we prefer cultural works we can categorize to the unfamiliar and undefinable \u2014 and we are facing an inescapable shock-and-awe barrage of genAI graphics across the web to inundate our synapses with uncanny synthetic renderings.\n\nCurrently, generative AI is shunned by many artists and writers, the traditional arbiters of good taste and culture, because it has been developed through the theft of their labor. But tech CEOs stand to make (even bigger) fortunes if they can convince people that genAI doesn\u2019t signify bad taste, or make it seem like an irrevocable fact of life, like spam emails and text scammers. It\u2019s being deployed upon us with the same lockstep corporate solidarity that forced us to pay fees for checked luggage on flights (younger folks, before 2008 your bag used to be included with your ticket! Stowing your carry-on wasn\u2019t a competitive sport back in the day.).", "label": "personal"}

I can\u2019t even be mad at it. Very comedy of errors, blundering heroes with no business being on a quest \u2014 Scooby Doo high fantasy. The lighthearted storytelling balanced out the extreme angst between the characters. I\u2019m a little surprised I liked it, because I think it could have easily been annoying \u2014 I was in the right mood.\n\nIt could have stood to be shorter and faster-paced \u2014 it took me three sessions to finish reading (usually I try to read books in one sitting) and I found myself getting testy at the 85% mark. I can see that shortening it would be hard with three POVs and the big hurdles they each needed to overcome.\n\nI\u2019m not convinced a second romance was necessary to the story, but it probably would have felt awfully third wheel if Elowen didn\u2019t have her own romance. (I think there could be a version of this story that made Beatrice into Gladwell\u2019s sister and was just her and Clare\u2026 which may have been a better romance than this story, but wouldn\u2019t be a DnD squad.)\n\nI didn\u2019t like Clare\u2019s bootstrap moment, and I\u2019m not actually sure what Beatrice\u2019s was?\n\nInteresting to see a romance publisher pushing in on the romantasy angle as well as sci-fi and fantasy publishers stretching towards romance.", "label": "personal"}

But I\u2019m not having a crisis about my personal life choices\u2026 instead I\u2019m having a crisis of generational impotence. I\u2019m tired of waiting for my generation\u2019s turn, which I am less and less convinced will come in time to make a difference, especially since GenZ seems to be going conservative \ud83d\ude11\n\nOuter South by Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band\n\nI finally got letters back from two of my reps:\n\nSenator Murray, 74yo and in office since 1993 when I was in third grade, wants me to know that she \u201cremain[s] committed to continuing to work with [her] colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find ways to make progress on immigration reform.\u201d Thank you for your complacency Senator. I don\u2019t know how immigration progress will be made with isolationist Nazis tbh \ud83e\uddd0 I don\u2019t get why Dems are taking conservative immigration stances when in my mind the problem is we are too strict on immigration, and should let in more people. There, birth rate \u201ccrisis\u201d solved too! What I want to know now is, what are the Senator\u2019s plans for retirement?\n\nRepresentative DelBene\u2019s office thinks I \u201cmay be pleased to know that [she] joined [her] Democratic colleagues in sending a letter to President Trump expressing serious concern about Mr. Abrego Garcia\u2019s case and requesting an immediate update on his wellbeing and how the administration plans to ensure his safe return to the United States.\u201d I am, in fact, not pleased. I am the opposite of pleased. Is she fucking with me? Does she not go on the Internet? In what world am I satisfied that she signed a strongly worded letter and called it good?\n\nMy resentment towards 80yo politicians who won\u2019t retire and pass their power to the next generation is reaching a rolling boil as the Democrats in charge apparently don\u2019t have an ounce of urgency left in their moldering bodies. I have to think it\u2019s intentional, especially given the way Nancy and co blocked Millennial AOC from a position of power in favor of an old dude with cancer who just died from it (\u201cGerry\u2019s a young 74, cancer notwithstanding\u201d \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44); I think Boomer politicians know how badly they\u2019ve fucked over everyone younger than them, and they will literally hold power until they die to prevent facing justice. (Yeah I\u2019m making it generational, they\u2019ve been demonizing Millennials to avoid looking in the mirror for decades.) They booted 25yo David Hogg from DNC leadership as punishment for suggesting the party should not always support incumbents, making a mockery of DEI principles by using gender equality rules to invalidate his election.\n\nA friend and I just looked it up: Nancy Pelosi was first elected in 1987. She has been in power for basically my entire life. And I am turning 40. Her legacy, in my mind? Losing women the right to bodily autonomy, for not taking Republicans seriously and doing anything about it when she could have. OK fine she did get us the ACA. Thanks lady. But it\u2019s time to go home, get some rest, and let someone else have a turn! (Sorry Bernie, I love ya man, but you too!!!)\n\nI think those in charge should have some stakes in the game. If you\u2019re already past the actuarial tables, you shouldn\u2019t get to make decisions for the rest of us who are going to live in the world our politicians make for potentially decades. (I expect the Supreme Court will be ultra conservative for the rest of my life because Dems wouldn\u2019t dare trying to expand it.) Be a mentor, yes, please! But give up the power. Normal retirement age is 67. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ageist to suggest it might be time for someone two decades past retirement age to pass the torch.\n\nGive me a party with energy, give me politicians who fight! Oh, for an opposition party \ud83e\udd7a I don\u2019t have to agree 100% with them, if they\u2019d just have some gumption. Give me AOC energy, Shawn Fain energy, Pete Buttigieg (!) energy, Cory Booker energy, Chris Van Hollen energy, Kat Abughazaleh energy. Not whatever this pathetic excuse for \u201cleadership\u201d is.

They both really needed replacing. We\u2019d hoped to have it done before the winter started since our furnace had already been on the fritz for several years \u2014 but the equipment was on backorder.\n\nMy energy utility, Puget Sound Energy (PSE), wants people to stay on gas, so there weren\u2019t incentives from them for this switch; however, my city developed a bulk purchase and incentive program to assist homeowners in transitioning to support the community\u2019s climate goals. This upgrade electrified our whole house, so we could shut off our gas service!*\n\nNow that I\u2019ve had a heat pump for a year, I wanted to share my experience, because I had questions and misconceptions that I didn\u2019t get answered beforehand. Tl;dr it\u2019s great, especially the cooling, just works a little differently.\n\n(Heads-up: 2500 word post, but it\u2019s got graphs! \ud83e\udd29)\n\n*Technically we still have a gas fireplace installed, but we never used it. PSE said it was safe to simply turn off even if that means there might be a small amount of gas remaining in the pipes under the house.\n\nWhy we got a heat pump\n\nOur old setup was failing\n\nBefore the upgrade, we had a ~20 year old gas furnace and an old gas water heater. In November 2019, a pipe on our water heater ruptured, spraying a ton of scalding water into our garage ceiling, filling the entire garage with steam that we had to hire a company to install fans for days to dry out. After that, the furnace began to fail regularly, falsely tripping the safety shut-off and needing to be restarted multiple times a day. We had people out to fix it multiple times, but the most they could figure was that something inside was corroded and they\u2019d clean it to buy us another few months.\n\nMy husband\u2019s telecommuted for years, and during the pandemic, I started working from home too \u2014 but the only \u201ccooling\u201d we had was a ceiling fan in our living room and dining room. We bought a used portable electric window A/C unit to keep my husband\u2019s office from turning into an inferno, and hefted it down the hall to our bedroom in the evenings. Less than ideal.\n\nNatural gas is terrible for the planet and for people\n\n\u201cNatural gas\u201d is the greenwashed industry name for methane, an extremely potent greenhouse gas. A lot of methane is fracked, which may have impacts on the health of surrounding communities. Methane is piped, often through First Nation people\u2019s lands without permission \u2014 think Keystone XL and Canada\u2019s Coastal GasLink pipeline \u2014 where it may leak and harm the water and ecosystem. Also, some methane leaks during fracking and distribution, contributing to emissions.\n\nMoreover, \u201cnatural gas\u201d is propped up by corporate propaganda that cooking with gas is better than electric, despite the atrocious impact methane has on indoor air quality and its contribution to household emissions. I have an electric stove, so I didn\u2019t have to replace mine in order to get off gas.\n\nWithout gas-burning appliances, our risk of carbon monoxide poisoning is lowered; it would come from some other source, like operating a propane stove indoors (DO NOT DO THAT THING). My husband knows someone who has brain damage from carbon monoxide poisoning!\n\nBasically, \u201cnatural gas\u201d is fucking shit and I want fucking nothing to do with it.\n\nMy new all-electric home energy setup\n\nMy house is about 1400s.f. and has two stories. It was built in the 1980s and our attic doesn\u2019t have enough insulation (we\u2019ve replaced insulation in the basement but not yet dealt with the attic).\n\nMitsubishi heat pump air handler (SVZ-KP24NA) \u2014 24,000 BTU/hour\n\nGeneral Aire residential whole-house air cleaner (GFI #4422 or 4424)\n\nMitsubishi wall head (split-type air conditioner MSZ-GL15NA) \u2014 one unit installed on second floor \u2014 we considered a second but decided to save $$$\n\n\n\n50-gallon electric water heater \u2014 the installer recommended against tankless despite what I\u2019d read online \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\n18-panel / 5.04kW solar system (Itek IT280 photovoltaic modules and Itek Theia HE\u2010t UL 3.8 kW inverter) \u2014 installed in 2015\n\nThe air handler connects to our existing duct system. There\u2019s the outdoor unit, which we placed on the side of the house directly below the upstairs heat pump head, and there\u2019s also the air cleaner in the garage where the old furnace was.\n\nThe city bulk purchase program we went through offered Mitsubishi heat pumps, and we just went with what the contractor recommended.\n\nHow much did the heat pump and electric water heater cost?\n\nI am located in the Seattle area, which has been in a housing boom for a while so contractors are pretty expensive.\n\nThe heat pump cost $19,445 + 10.2% tax for equipment and installation. The permit cost $236.*\n\nThe electric water heater with new dedicated 220v circuit cost $2,145 + 10.2% tax.\n\nOur city provided a $500 incentive and coordinated a $1,200 discount for bulk purchase of equipment, so in total we paid $22,155 for both heat pump and new water heater.\n\n*The permit included an inspection, which failed the first time \u2014 we wouldn\u2019t have known what wasn\u2019t installed quite right, so thanks inspector! He was super helpful and pointed out some other unrelated things he noticed that we might consider acting on.\n\nHeat pump vs. gas furnace energy use comparisons\n\nMy situation will not be directly comparable to most people\u2019s because we have a solar array, but hopefully will still provide a relative comparison. I have provided the electricity we used, which includes power we generated and used directly, but not power we generated and sold back to PSE.\n\nUnfortunately since we upgraded the water heater at the same time, we can\u2019t isolate only the cost of the heat pump \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nObnoxiously, our power bill comes mid-month. To make life easier for myself in the graphs, I\u2019ve represented the month the bill was issued. That typically covers usage from the 18th of the previous month through the 17th of the billing month \ud83d\ude15\n\nContext: weather and energy trends in the Pacific Northwest\n\nFor usage context, in the Seattle area, it\u2019s relatively cool (and we run heating) from mid September through early June. Summer is usually relatively moderate, typically peaking with one or two weeks in the 90s (F). Over 100F is unusual.\n\nHow much more electricity did the heat pump use?\n\nThese data represent solely our electricity use, so you can guesstimate how much electricity we use for heating (and cooling) by how much our electricity increased after January 2023. During the cold months (December through March bills), we used about 1200-1500 additional kWh (for heating our space and water). Over the whole year, we used an additional 7300kWh compared to the previous year. (According to PSE, it\u2019s typical to use about 2800kWh annually for an electric water heater and 6800kWh for a heat pump, or 9600kWh annually.)\n\nYou\u2019ll see that we had a big jump in electricity use in January 2024 (technically mid December through mid January). This coincides with an extremely cold snap for Washington, with temperatures in the ~19 degree Fahrenheit range for about a week. We didn\u2019t adjust our thermostat during that time period, but did run the heat pump head overnight as well as pulled out a small standalone electric space heater to help keep the house warmer during the day.\n\nMonthly kWh electricity used, Sept. 16 2021-Jan. 17, 2024 Month 2021 2022 2023 2024 kWh difference\n\nwith heat pump 1 499 495 1946 1451 2 419 *1044 *625 3 545 1737 1192 4 681 1617 936 5 695 1120 425 6 531 993 462 7 1003 1213 210 8 1212 1059 -153 9 868 973 105 10 577 721 880 159 11 466 541 1274 733 12 430 500 1651 1151\n\nbold = electric only \u2014 heat pump installed January 30, 2023\n\n* About half the February 2023 billing cycle was on gas heat\n\n\n\nHow much methane usage did we eliminate?\n\nIn 2022, we used 770 therms of methane.* Now, we use none! \ud83d\ude4c\n\n*According to PSE, a typical house uses 690 therms for a gas furnace and 160 therms for a gas water heater, or 850 therms annually.\n\nComparing gas therms and kWh electricity\n\nA therm is equal to approximately 29 kWh. Unless I\u2019m being totally unreasonable in converting and combining these values, here\u2019s how the overall kWh shakes out \u2014 a massive reduction in energy used with the heat pump (Feb 2023-Jan 2024):\n\nHow much did it cost to run the heat pump versus the gas furnace?\n\nThe first month we used the heat pump for cooling, I was braced for a radical energy bill, but thanks to our solar panels, we continued to pay the minimum electrical charge in summer \ud83e\uddbe\n\nIn actual costs, we paid $1435 for energy (gas and electricity) in 2022 and $1158 in 2023 (heat pump only); if we assumed that the four summer months of 2022 were $7.95 as in a normal year, that would still put 2022 at $1215. And if we swapped in this year\u2019s all-electric January bill for last year\u2019s gas-heated bill, that\u2019s basically a wash. And now we have whole-house cooling in summer \ud83d\ude0e\n\nMonthly energy bill by year, Sept. 16 2021-Jan. 17, 2024 Month 2021 2022 2023 2024 1 $218.41 *$229.79 $260.96 2 $158.67 $202.26 3 $148.30 $188.41 4 $108.26 $91.73 5 $79.85 $28.09 6 $51.67 $7.95 7 *$36.18 $7.95 8 *$76.16 $7.95 9 *$86.90 $7.95 10 $71.32 *$84.62 $46.02 11 $101.87 *$161.19 $136.05 12 $143.28 *$224.62 $204.68\n\nbold = electric only \u2014 heat pump installed January 30, 2023\n\n* = our solar inverter was not selling electricity back to PSE these months, though was generating power for pass-through usage \u2014 in a normal year the summer month costs would be the minimum $7.95 \u2014 this also means there was no bank to draw from for those fall and winter months\n\nWhat I wish we\u2019d known before switching to a heat pump\n\nIt heats differently than a gas furnace: slow and steady versus bursts of heat\n\nThe first month we had our heat pump, in the cold of February 2023, I was convinced it was broken or we\u2019d been sold too small of a unit. If you go in with expectations that it\u2019s going to be a different heating experience than a gas furnace, you\u2019ll be happier than I was at first \ud83d\ude09\n\nBeing used to a gas furnace, we were used to saying, \u201cIt\u2019s cold!\u201d and bumping the thermostat* up a couple degrees, then getting the immediate feedback of a big blast of hot air and a relatively quick increase in temperature.\n\nIn contrast, the heat pump blows air lightly all day long**. If we increase the thermostat setting, it will take several hours to reach the new temperature. Likewise, when it\u2019s too cold out, sometimes it has a hard time keeping up. (I\u2019m hoping that upping our attic insulation will help hold the temperature better.)\n\n*We had a Nest before, but I don\u2019t think it actually helped save energy since we were home all day every day, so between that and Google\u2019s creepy surveillance I was fine when I found out the heat pump came with a thermostat and wouldn\u2019t work with the Nest. Unfortunately, the included thermostat is kind of annoying to program.\n\n**Because heat pumps blow constantly, the contractor recommended keeping as many vents open as possible \u2014 closing no more than one or two. (There was a technical reason for this that I forget, something about making part of the heat pump get too cold and shut down.) Unfortunately, whoever installed our original HVAC system was, er, clearly the low bidder, so we have wacky vents directly underneath windows and doors all over the house \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f The register that blows the hottest is our downstairs bathroom \ud83d\ude44\n\nSo, with the heat pump, we don\u2019t drop the temperature overnight as much as we did with the gas furnace. We keep the house a more consistent temperature all the time. Then, the poor heat pump isn\u2019t always struggling to keep up, it just holds what it\u2019s got.\n\nThe heads aren\u2019t as quiet as they\u2019re made out to be\n\nWhoever says they\u2019re basically silent hasn\u2019t paid much attention. The heat pump head (which is in our bedroom) makes mysterious noises pretty often, particularly when in heating mode*. My poor cat Mina stares at it, transfixed in horror, as it tinkles like broken glass going through the wash, whooshes like the house is blasting off, brrrs to life unexpectedly, and whirs as the louvers rotate up and down randomly. It sometimes makes noise even when the unit is turned off, which is confusing.\n\nThe fan noises are relatively quiet, especially in comparison with a window AC unit, so that\u2019s probably the frame of reference people have when they talk about it being silent. But it\u2019s not silent if you\u2019re changing from forced air, which actually is basically silent \ud83d\ude09 Overall, it\u2019s not too intrusive and totally worth it for being able to fine-tune the comfort level of our bedroom, but not quite what I had anticipated.\n\n*I am pretty sensitive to noise, but my husband and cats agree on this one \ud83d\ude09\n\nOur verdict: the heat pump is a huge win for summer, good for winter\n\nIt kicks ass in summer\n\nWow, after previously not having cooling in summer, it was incredible to be able to comfortably use my office after like 3pm in the summer \ud83d\ude02 I was especially the beneficiary because in the past my husband got the portable A/C unit since his office was hotter.\n\nThe heat pump couldn\u2019t keep up with the hottest days in the high nineties, but even then still kept the house in comfortable mid to high eighties \u2014 totally fine for us, especially with a ceiling fan.\n\nGood in normal cold, fine in cold cold\n\nOnce we learned how to program the thermostat appropriately, we\u2019ve been happy with how the heat pump keeps the house warm.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest: this thing struggles with the cold cold (below freezing). From my understanding, actually cold places use a backup furnace IIRC, but the temperature\u2019s generally moderate enough in Seattle that we get by with just a heat pump and suck it up for the one or two extra-cold weeks a year.\n\nDuring our recent cold snap, when it was 16 degrees Fahrenheit overnight one night, the house was 55 degrees when we went downstairs in the morning despite the thermostat being set to 68. It didn\u2019t heat up much during the morning, so we pulled out our little electric space heater and an electric heating pad to boost the warmth, and bundled up with down vests and blankets. This is where the heat pump head is key: we were able to keep our bedroom, where the head is located, comfortable overnight (though we did add extra blankets).\n\nAnd honestly? The heat pump\u2019s so much more efficient, better for the climate, and safer for us that wearing a jacket for a week or two in the winter seems like a totally reasonable tradeoff.", "label": "personal"}

A former seminary student who was obsessed with ancient Greece, he started each practice with a philosophy discussion. He wove in, too, tales of past runners and triumphs \u2014 he\u2019d been coach for nearly thirty years already \u2014 creating our own pantheon of heroes, the team\u2019s own mythos. Who of us would one day join its ranks?\n\nMr. Taylor recognized how much the mind and body are connected. He treated our labor seriously, and expected us to do the same. Excellence \u2014 ar\u00eate \u2014 was our goal. I\u2019ll admit that plenty of times I tuned out the talk, but there was something about sitting down as a team to transition from school to sport, using that time to mentally prepare for the physical work.\n\nOne of my favorite rituals was to honor outgoing seniors on the cross-country team. At the final home race of the season, each senior released one of his homing pigeons. (I was annoyed because I had to share a pigeon \ud83d\ude02) As far as I can remember, there was no special meaning to this, it just was a thing that he made happen each year. A created ceremony we nonetheless looked forward to; simply having some marker, however arbitrary, gave the season an emotional culmination beyond the final race, recognition of our contributions to the team regardless of how we placed.\n\nHe built the team\u2019s culture through these shared rites and rituals, building a sense of continuity with past runners both at our school and at the origins of track in Ancient Greece.\n\nI can\u2019t talk about ritual and Mr. Taylor without also talking about Ar\u00eate West. Starting in 1979, every other year he took a group of about eight students from the track or cross country team to Greece. At first, they went to compete, but over the years it shifted into more of a philosophical journey and extended into greater Europe. Over the course of twenty trips, the experience developed its own rituals. (I went on trip thirteen.)\n\nThe first: secret invitation. My best friend hounded me, but I wouldn\u2019t confess that I\u2019d received The Postcard telling me when and where our first meeting would be. (We met every other week throughout the school year to study and prepare for the trip.) We all showed up that first night unsure who the seven other voyagers would be. In my year, the eighth person no-showed \u2014 we never found out who else had been invited and declined to join.\n\nThe trip itself teemed with rituals. My least favorite involved running through the hot, dusty Greek countryside to an ancient track where we were expected to take off our shoes and run a lap in bare feet, like the runners of old. On Ithaca, we ran, separately, to \u201cTelemachos\u2019 beach\u201d. In Delphi, we were meant to sleep in \u201cthe meadow\u201d where many past Arete trips had slept (but he couldn\u2019t find it in the twilight, so we slept on a random dirt road \ud83d\ude12 Apparently on my sister\u2019s trip there was a dead dog in the meadow and they said no fucking way).\n\nMr. Taylor believed strongly in the power of place and designed the experience to provoke encounters with meaning. (Some more successful than others\u2026) I lugged my clarinet across Europe so I could play Mozart\u2019s clarinet concerto outside the building where he died (?). Everywhere we went, one or another of us had been assigned topics to present on or locations to give a reading. (I botched my reading from The Agony and The Ecstasy at the Vatican and read a passage about the wrong Michaelangelo Mother and Child sculpture \ud83e\udd23) Overlooking the Acropolis, one of the boys had to read us Pericles\u2019s funeral speech, as each trip had done before us. In Sils Maria, we walked in Nietzsche\u2019s footsteps and discussed quotes at various waypoints along the trail. Our trip was our own, yet inextricably linked with previous trips through shared touchstones and repeated experiences: rituals meant to connect us to the past, both modern and ancient.\n\nThis is my contribution to the August IndieWeb Blog Carnival, hosted by Steve Ledlow on the theme of ritual.", "label": "personal"}

I started at 11 and was wiped by 2:30 so I didn\u2019t push myself to squeeze in one more.\n\nEnjoyed talking with several of the homeowners too \u2014 one of them has written a book on mushrooming! He had a massive table spread with morels drying in the sun.\n\n\u201cChampagne Creek\u201d\n\n\u201cThis private garden has expanded and grown into a utopia of rare plants, exotic fowl, native habitat and so much more.\u201d \u201cWhimsical eclecticism is Kathy\u2019s guiding principle.\u201d\n\n\u201cBloom\u201d\n\n\u201cThis 1/2-acre garden is an artistic attempt to paint with flowers and plants: full of color, texture and whimsy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Half Acre Wood\u201d\n\n\u201cEvergreen Hollow\u201d\n\n\u201cNestled in the lush climate of the PNW, Evergreen Hollow is a harmonious fusion of Japanese serenity, whimsical fairy charm, and intricate bonsai artistry.\u201d\n\n\u201cDahlia House Gardens\u201d\n\n\u201cOur gardens, at over an acre, are a controlled chaos of thousands of perennials, fruit trees, berry bushes and veggie gardens. We have collected seeds and plants from Tibet, Europe and elsewhere and enjoy a very English style profusion with lawn and intertwined stairs and hidden trails.\u201d (This garden was very much my vibe.)\n\nTakeaways\n\nIt\u2019s lovely to see stunning gardens like these, but also having paid for landscaping, I have to distinguish between what someone could accomplish with many tens of thousands of dollars of hardscaping and what could be adaptable to my yard. Some of the gardens leaned on sweat equity and cleverness, which is what my budget calls for \ud83d\ude09 Boulders are $$$ as much as I love how they look \ud83e\udd7a (Our landscape plan originally called for a fountain but the landscaper wasn\u2019t willing to wait for electricity to be trenched, since it would need an inspection, even though they saw the plans when we got the quote \ud83d\ude44 so, we have a bird bath)\n\nI think some cheapish landscaping cobblestones, metal arches, and more yard art could go a fair ways to adding finish to my garden. I also suspect another couple Japanese maples could pull things together. More paths / focal points in the backyard would be beneficial visually \u2014 we didn\u2019t bother because the freeway is so loud we just wanted it to look pretty out the window \u2014 but I\u2019m finding that there is a lack of places for the eye to land when it\u2019s all green all the time. Without a lawn, and with the path so close to the house you can\u2019t see it from inside, we have few \u201cedges\u201d.", "label": "personal"}

Outright fascism is worse, but there are plenty of things we need to change. Kat Abughazaleh, who\u2019s running for office in Illinois, says:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason every American should not be able to afford housing, groceries, health insurance, public transit (ideally), and then still have enough money to save and take your kid to the zoo or go to the movies with your friends. There\u2019s just, there\u2019s no reason \u2014 we are the wealthiest country in the world. The idea that that\u2019s unrealistic or idealistic or naive or even called childish, I think that\u2019s sucky.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t have to settle for returning to a normal that sucks \u2014 but protest may not be enough to force change. Our current situation has been the Republican gameplan for decades; we will not escape it by liberating ourselves from a single politician. Trump is a symptom, but the rot runs much deeper. We need to reckon emotionally with the long fights ahead; protests alone will not solve our problems. I\u2019m not saying protest isn\u2019t helpful or important \u2014 I\u2019m saying that we need to find space for both brunch and advocacy in our lives. Micah L. Sifry writes:\n\nOne of the most inspiring ways that pro-democracy movements grow their strength is by inventing and spreading ways for the silent majority to make itself both visible and influential.\n\nI\u2019ve been seeing organizers talking about the need to transform the current energy into long-term work, and not let it fizzle out. Jared Yates Sexton describes the way that authorities rein in public speech:\n\nWe are, according to those who want nothing more than to maintain control, supposed to protest enough, but not too much. Because we should rely on them. Because we need to maintain our subservient position under the party as opposed to in conversation and discourse with the party.\n\nOne strategy: focusing on local advocacy and building up\n\nMy pet theory is that most people should spend their advocacy time supporting local (and state) efforts, and donate to organizations advocating at the federal level. The collapse of local news and intense media focus on national politics encourages people to feel powerless because at the federal level most of what you can do is harass your senator. It also frames politics as something \u201cyou do\u201d once every four years for normies, every two years for the passionate, every election for the wonks and zealots. If you get people involved in local politics, I imagine that get-out-the-vote drives become a lot easier because people are already tuned in.\n\nThe local level is more influential than people realize, I suspect. In Washington State, how environmental policies often play out is that they get implemented at either King County or City of Seattle first, then several suburban cities, and then there\u2019s a model and coalition for building a state-level policy. As former city staff, I can say it\u2019s no accident it works this way \u2014 we knew our colleagues at other cities and would learn from each other, sharing lessons and draft policy language. Regional organizations support, both partnering with cities and going down to Olympia during the legislative session to advocate for (and against) bills. We know that Republicans followed a similar model in the evil direction in red states, building up a portfolio of harmful policies to bring to the federal level in the form of Project 2025\u2026 why don\u2019t we do the same for progressive policies?\n\nIf we start thinking and working now, we can set things up for the next state legislative session, then the next federal election, then the presidential election. (I\u2019m not going down rabbitholes about martial law, I don\u2019t find it helpful to indulge in that kind of despairing fatalism \u2014 I think my personal work on managing catastrophic thinking and anxiety has paid dividends here.)\n\nI haven\u2019t decided what bigger thing I want to work on yet\u2026 for now I\u2019ve just been doing ad hoc advocacy when it\u2019s pointed out by the urbanist Discord server I\u2019m in. I\u2019m pissed that Washington had a school lunch bill that failed in the legislative session, so potentially supporting another run at that\u2026 or badgering the governor about Washington\u2019s regressive taxation policy and demanding an income tax on the wealthiest Washingtonians, which he put the kibosh on this budget cycle and was why the budget was too tight to feed kids \ud83d\ude44 Come on, Bob! We have a lot of tech companies \u2014 and tech CEOs \u2014 here who could stand to pay their fair share. Or I could go harder on supporting housing; I just looked at King County\u2019s affordable housing dashboard, which identifies a need for 44,000 affordable units by 2024, and THE ENTIRE SEATTLE AREA HAD BUILT FEWER THAN FIVE THOUSAND UNITS by 2022. *screaming*\n\nOrganizing coalitions\n\nI\u2019m also spinning on the provocation of the second method of organizing described in the Win the Midwest\u2019s 10-year report (emphasis mine):\n\nThere are two approaches to base building. We can ask what we are for, and then go out and find the people who agree with us. Or we can begin by asking who we need to organize in order to build enough power to shift everything, and then go where they are: workplaces, churches, mosques, synagogues, schools, and childcare centers. Grassroots organizations that meet people where they are \u2013 physically and ideologically \u2013 and that create spaces of belonging, learning, and formation rooted in people\u2019s lives and experiences have an unlimited number of people to organize. Most people do not have clearly defined political outlooks, but they can move into public leadership roles. Organizations willing to put their base at the center of their plans can co-create a political agenda that emerges from the lived experience of their bases.\n\nI\u2019m an extremely opinionated person, and I know what outcomes I want (though I\u2019d rather listen to others on the best tactics on achieving those outcomes), but maybe I could think of this as prioritizing which outcomes to focus on based on which ones enough other people also want and will fight for. L.A. Kauffman discusses building coalitions with those we disagree with, quoting a 1981 talk / 1983 essay \u201cCoalition Politics: Turning the Century\u201d:\n\n\u201cThe reason we are stumbling,\u201d Dr. [Bernice] Reagon declared all those years ago, \u201cis that we are at the point where in order to take the next step we\u2019ve got to do it with some folk we don\u2019t care too much about. And we got to vomit over that for a little while. We must just keep going.\u201d\n\nFurther reading:\n\nWhy Do Anything? by Dj Bracken \u2014 this guy decided to start paying down student lunch debt in Utah, and eventually helped get a statewide bill passed (I was loosely involved in supporting new \u201cshare tables\u201d / fridges at our local elementary schools, AMA)\n\nFrom Aspiration to Action: Organizing Through Exhaustion, Grief, and Uncertainty by Kelly Hayes\n\nSee also:\n\nDon\u2019t let them say it\u2019s normal\n\nExtending my understanding of self-care\n\nBeing a citizen means taking ownership", "label": "personal"}

But I\u2019m not having a crisis about my personal life choices\u2026 instead I\u2019m having a crisis of generational impotence. I\u2019m tired of waiting for my generation\u2019s turn, which I am less and less convinced will come in time to make a difference, especially since GenZ seems to be going conservative \ud83d\ude11\n\nOuter South by Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band\n\nI finally got letters back from two of my reps:\n\nSenator Murray, 74yo and in office since 1993 when I was in third grade, wants me to know that she \u201cremain[s] committed to continuing to work with [her] colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find ways to make progress on immigration reform.\u201d Thank you for your complacency Senator. I don\u2019t know how immigration progress will be made with isolationist Nazis tbh \ud83e\uddd0 I don\u2019t get why Dems are taking conservative immigration stances when in my mind the problem is we are too strict on immigration, and should let in more people. There, birth rate \u201ccrisis\u201d solved too! What I want to know now is, what are the Senator\u2019s plans for retirement?\n\nRepresentative DelBene\u2019s office thinks I \u201cmay be pleased to know that [she] joined [her] Democratic colleagues in sending a letter to President Trump expressing serious concern about Mr. Abrego Garcia\u2019s case and requesting an immediate update on his wellbeing and how the administration plans to ensure his safe return to the United States.\u201d I am, in fact, not pleased. I am the opposite of pleased. Is she fucking with me? Does she not go on the Internet? In what world am I satisfied that she signed a strongly worded letter and called it good?\n\nMy resentment towards 80yo politicians who won\u2019t retire and pass their power to the next generation is reaching a rolling boil as the Democrats in charge apparently don\u2019t have an ounce of urgency left in their moldering bodies. I have to think it\u2019s intentional, especially given the way Nancy and co blocked Millennial AOC from a position of power in favor of an old dude with cancer who just died from it (\u201cGerry\u2019s a young 74, cancer notwithstanding\u201d \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44); I think Boomer politicians know how badly they\u2019ve fucked over everyone younger than them, and they will literally hold power until they die to prevent facing justice. (Yeah I\u2019m making it generational, they\u2019ve been demonizing Millennials to avoid looking in the mirror for decades.) They booted 25yo David Hogg from DNC leadership as punishment for suggesting the party should not always support incumbents, making a mockery of DEI principles by using gender equality rules to invalidate his election.\n\nA friend and I just looked it up: Nancy Pelosi was first elected in 1987. She has been in power for basically my entire life. And I am turning 40. Her legacy, in my mind? Losing women the right to bodily autonomy, for not taking Republicans seriously and doing anything about it when she could have. OK fine she did get us the ACA. Thanks lady. But it\u2019s time to go home, get some rest, and let someone else have a turn! (Sorry Bernie, I love ya man, but you too!!!)\n\nI think those in charge should have some stakes in the game. If you\u2019re already past the actuarial tables, you shouldn\u2019t get to make decisions for the rest of us who are going to live in the world our politicians make for potentially decades. (I expect the Supreme Court will be ultra conservative for the rest of my life because Dems wouldn\u2019t dare trying to expand it.) Be a mentor, yes, please! But give up the power. Normal retirement age is 67. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ageist to suggest it might be time for someone two decades past retirement age to pass the torch.\n\nGive me a party with energy, give me politicians who fight! Oh, for an opposition party \ud83e\udd7a I don\u2019t have to agree 100% with them, if they\u2019d just have some gumption. Give me AOC energy, Shawn Fain energy, Pete Buttigieg (!) energy, Cory Booker energy, Chris Van Hollen energy, Kat Abughazaleh energy. Not whatever this pathetic excuse for \u201cleadership\u201d is. Walz had the energy and they told him to stuff it. Brilliant strategy guys.\n\nPlease, please tell me someone is primarying all my Federal reps next election, because I will vote for anyone who shows some semblance of spine \ud83d\ude21", "label": "personal"}

Next we introduced ourselves to the ladies. They are some nice people. The laugh a lot. Like nonstop. Lol.\n\nWe went to go grab some lunch at the diner. The food was great. Im going to love this school. I like the ice cream the best .\n\nOur first activity was about culture. We were asked about describing our culture. Its was quite the open question. It wws alson hard at the same time. It shocked me that many of the participants didn\u2019t know where there culture was from or any inform about it. It was a learning experience for all of us.\n\nThen we did another activity comparing different cultures in different countries or groups of people. it was interesting seeing the differences.\n\nAfter all this we had dinner. Didn\u2019t meat much. I had the option to go to the swimming pools or go do something else. So Colin and i decided to do manly things like excersise. The girls went to the pool instead. I ran a out two miles. While running, Colin worked on his football workout. He is going to be a kicker for the UNK football team. Which is pretty awesome.\n\nI then after we played apples to apples. It was quite intense. Then it got crazy funny. The girls were just losing it with nonstop laughing. It was fun. Hey! We had pizza!\n\nOverall I\u2019m enjoying this camp. I\u2019m making some great friends and being around people who have great interests as I do.", "label": "personal"}

Who knew old fashion was better? Breakfast wasn't what I was used to. It consisted of A slice of bread with cold cut (deli) meats. You cant forget a great cup of joe! What a simple breakfast? we made kolaches. Kolaches are a traditional food in the Czech Republic. They are formed like a cookie. We make a crater in the center to fill it with fillings. Fillings like apricot or cherry fillings. We also had cream cheese filling. Here is the result.\n\nDelicious right??\n\nThen we went on a tour around Wilber. We learned the history and reasons people moved here. One was religious freedom. (Sound familiar?)\n\nI got to play the bagpipes. It was odd but cool at the same time.\n\n[caption id=\"\"attachment_261\"\" align=\"\"alignnone\"\" width=\"\"225\"\"] Me playing the bagpipes[/caption]\n\nThen we learned how to dance polka and some waltz. It was fun. Now i can dance! (I was salsa dancing in Omaha yesterday.) We had an amazing lunch that consisted of duck, dumplings, sourkrout, and a kolache for dessert. I tought it was best meal in a long time. Czech food is actually good and healthy. Richard I'm coming to the Czech Republic for more food. LOL :-P\n\nTo end the stay in wilber Nebraska the local children entertained us by showing us traditional dances in traditional outfits. I think it is cool that these children are continuing their traditions.\n\nNow I'm back in the dorms. Going to go get ice cream or something. Then I'll go work out with my roommate and have some bro time.\n\nFollow my blog by registering!! On the left!!!\n\n\"", "label": "personal"}

Might as well write for today also!\n\nWe started our day with origami. It was a fun activity (if you can get past step 1.) I've done some origami over the years. It was a struggle a bit trying to build something. Not to bad after you get the hang of it.\n\nThen We had a leadership activity with Dr. Machida. It was really fun getting to know about Japan and Dr. Machida's experiences abroad at a young age. It really motivates me to study abroad!! :)\n\nI also learned how to use chopsticks. Who knew that it could be fun? It was a challenge none less.... Now I want to use them at any Chinese place.\n\nAfter Lunch We got to meet some of the students that have been on a study abroad program. Some went to the Czech Republic or Netherlands. They told us their crazy adventures. They also explained some struggles and surprises they experience. I felt like I related to them since I have also gone out of the country plenty of times. They really assured us that it is totally worth it.\n\nWe had some of the international students help us with calligraphy. They helped us all write our names in Japanese. This but also words that had a meaning to our own. I picked 'potential' and 'perseverance.' I say they did a great job . Props to you guys.\n\nThe chopsticks lesson came to great use!! We went to a Chinese restaurant. I ordered spicy chicken. Used my chopsticks to eat my entree. I felt like I succeeded at a life.\n\nLater everyone decided to take naps after a very busy day. I passed out on my bed, so did my roommate on his.\n\nI stayed up later to watch some funny movies... it was totally worth it :) :)\"", "label": "personal"}

My goal is not to get homesick (I will eventually). Like I said I am not going away that far (45 mins.) It is time for me to be more independent of myself.

Man I LOVE COLLEGE! Its music to my ears.\n\nInstead of being a lazy bum and staying in bed all day, I decided to spend my day outside in the good ol' Nebraska cold winter.

Examples of different cultures are the hispanic culture, italian, french, etc. Especially here at UNK we are more exposed than ever to different cultures.\n\nToday I want to talk about how people should be open minded and talk about how one should expose themselves too a different culture. Many of us who are small town people never really grew up with people of a different race or background. There is no harm in that. Once we all came to college we saw how diverse our world really is.. For me I've grown up in two cultures parallel to each other. I grew up in a very hispanic family while being born in to the American culture that I have known since the day I was born. So I could say that I am used to different cultures.\n\nThrough out our lives, we find people who are different from us in various ways. Different can mean being from another country. Being from a different country you have different aspects of the world. Being different is good. Those who are totally different from you are International Students.\n\nI say one should befriend an international student. Help them out. It would mean the world to them. You thought you were scared when you went off to college, they are probably three times as scared since they are in a country that they have never been in before. They will be greatful when you do help them. I know if you ever need a favor from them, they will gladly go up and beyond to help you suceed if you need help from them. It does not hurt to hangout with them. They will learn so much just being around you. You will as well. It is a win-win situation. Take them out to lunch sometime so you get to know them. They will gladly prepare a meal for you sometime. You may not think about it now but they could be of future help when needing to get a job, if they are already in the workforce.\n\nI love to learn about the other cultures. It fascinates me how different and similar cultures are. Me being the avid FOOD LOVER <3 I love to \"\"test\"\" new food for my belly to enjoy. I did not realize that I loved Japanese foodso much. I think that best part other than the insides is the seaweed to make some of them sushi entrees. NO one has anything to lose by opening themselves up to something different. You know what they say\n\nYOU NEVER KNOW UNTIL YOU TRY!\n\nI say go for it!\n\nWhile you can enjoy a culture festival. Here at UNK we have many of these. The most recent one I went to was the Japanese Food Festival. I learned so much about the Japanese culture. I got to see what their traditions truly embrace than just rely on stereotypes. I have made many Japanese friends as well. Being around theses students, you really get a one to one learning opportunity. It really teaches others not to be afraid and to always remember where one came from originally.\n\nThe food was great! Job well done to those in charge of the event. It was a one to remember. Who know it would of been SO much fun to make Japanese food. I want more! Someone hook me up!!\n\nMaybe I'll see you guys at the International Food Festival this Sunday!\n\nCheck out my gallery!!\n\n\"", "label": "personal"}

We travel, we work our butts off to have some financial gains and stability. What's that for a college kid? Summer is also a time to think ahead into the future while enjoying yourself. It is unfortunate that this this adventure is only temporary to help us get away. That being said, I am going to tell you about my summer adventures and what it entails. The summer is slowly slipping to the end...\n\nWorking is important to make money. That's exactly what I have done throughout the summer. For those who do not know, I work at McDonald's as a manager. It pays me well to let me go on adventures. (More on that in a second.) Like any job, it has it's ups and downs. Honestly I am surprised that I have stayed as long as I have. 5 years strong! WOO! Its a job that has many benefits than just the paycheck.\n\nSo now you want to know what I actually did for fun? Alright! One thing at a time.\n\nSo my first adventure was hitting the upper west coast! It was the trip trio: three friends, three places! We went to started our trip off in Denver to catch a flight out of DEN towards Seattle. Seattle was such a beautiful city. Then we crossed into Canada where we spend a few days in Vancouver, BC. Canada was breath taking. I was glad to see Canada for the first time. It was exciting to see one of my friends leave the country for the first time ever! I got to speak a little French here and there.\n\nCan always count on these guys to push me through anything! #summer #canada A photo posted by Pablo Morales (@pmorales18) on Jun 11, 2016 at 7:04pm PDT\n\nI went to Denver a second time recently to the Vans Warped Tour! This is my second year going to this I got to see some of my favorite bands this year! Many of you heard that Yellow Card is breaking up!! I about cried when I heard this. They have their reasons and I respect them for that. They have had such an impact on me.\n\nI got to hangout with friends all throughout. Frienships grew!\n\nThis is only a summary of my summer. Want to know? Just ask!\n\n-Pablo\"", "label": "personal"}
{"title": "Pablo Morales", "url": "https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/published:2016-08", "content": "en\n\n\"Junior year of college is the turning point of most people's education. It is the time where the most people are deep into their major. You know, the point where it seems too late to turn back. This is not the case for me.\n\nI've changed my major various times to in the last two years. It has not been the easiest process. In most cases it revolved around me jumping back and forth between different areas of science or healthcare related fields to humanities. Not deciding what I wanted in my life has had an effect on my greatly. Many friends know to what extent this led too. Thinking back on this tossing and turning made me realize how I truly did not have a passion for the sciences. You know what it really showed me? I am a person who is very stubborn. I was in denial. Deep down inside, there was no want for me to continue in the sciences. My mindset was not open to explore other options. I felt like a failure if I did not become something in the sciences or be something in healthcare. Avoiding disappointment and failure had become the way my life driving towards.\n\nThere comes a time where you have to wake up and come to reality that you really do not have interest in what you are shooting for after attempting various attempts. I should have followed my heart from the very beginning. My advice to you,\n\n\"\"Do not let anyone tell you what you should study. Only y0u know what you want in life.\"\"\n\nI did that mistake and did not follow my dreams right away. It took a lot of courage for me to stand up to myself. It is sort of shocking, huh? The mind is is your worst enemy. I am glad that I did what I did.\n\nNow I am following my passion. A passion that I have always known to have since the first time I took this class in high school. There is this a major sense of relief. I announce that I will fully commit to become a teacher and strive for what I feel that I will do best\n\nThank you for the support.\n\nWith much love,\n\nPablo Morales\n\n\"", "label": "personal"}

I enjoy the freedoms, living independently and eating good food whenever I want. Life has treated me good here. Until more recently, a certain stage of being away finally starts. Lately, homesickness has really started to kick in. I\u2019ve really started to miss my friends, family and things I really took for granted back home. It really is bad when I am craving my mom\u2019s homemade food. (Mexican Food.) Midterms and all the studying is really killing my vibe at this point of the semester. My program is not your typical study abroad program that you go away for 3 months (not to mention that it doesn\u2019t even apply to your major) on a semi vacation. I actually have to try real hard as my french studies here in Strasbourg France will help me graduate next year. Enough bashing.\n\nWith all this, one just feels that they are slowly losing control. Sure I am enjoying myself out here in France but still there is this emptiness of something that I have been away from for far too long. Hopefully, I hope some sort of enlightenment will come bring me back to life. Then It hit me, I would see my friends in just a few weeks. I honestly couldn\u2019t believe in such short time I would be right in front of them.\n\nSo I would be meeting up my good friend Sammy and soon-to-be friend Mitch. They have never been to Europe before, so I figured why not show them around Paris, a city that I know decently and use my French to get to Point A to Point B and of course with the help of good ol\u2019 Google Maps. Paris- Weekend 1\n\nThese guys had a hell of a time getting to Paris during the 24 hours before arrival. I\u2019ll let them explain that one.\n\nSo I picked the guys up from Charles De Gaulle Aiport. I still feel bad on making you guys wait for me. :/ I ran up to my dude Sammy and gave him a bro hug! It has been way to long since I have seen that dude! I also got to meet Mitch and got to know him more through out the weekend. Cool Dude! So I showed them around Paris. To be honest, Paris is beautiful with history written all around. As with any major city, Paris is no exception, it is dirty and smelly. I really hope that the guys did not have too high of hopes for the \u201cCity of Love.\u201d Paris is overrated in my opinion but why not take advantage of leaving Strasbourg for a few days.\n\nSo we went to various monuments such as The Louvre, Arc of Triumph, Versailles and so much more. Many of the places were breath taking. The Eiffel Tour is always a good place to scope out as well as walking along the Seine River. Getting around Paris is no piece of cake but we managed. Never have I ever gone up so many round staircases. Climbing the Cathedral of Notre Dame was such a struggle. Whenever you are in Europe, walking is really the way to get around.\n\nNight life in Paris is pretty popping! We went to a few clubs in the Grand Boulevard District! This district did not disappoint. I wish we could have checked out a few other ones. One of my favorite places was the Irish Pub. Music, dancing, girls and drinks. Man was that a fun night!\n\nWe ate some good food throughout Paris. The guys had their first legit French Croissants and baguette sandwich. It\u2019s totally acceptable to have a sandwich on you at all times. I also had them try one of my favorites, a kebab sandwich. Man are they delicious! Sammy had actual ramen noodles for the first time ever! Overall we pretty much stuffed our faces all weekend.\n\nBruxelles- Weekend 2\n\nAh Bruxelles!! The place known for its deliciouos fries and waffles. You have no idea how much I stuffed my face this weekend. Just writing this post makes my mouth water. Was eating all this food this worth it? You bet it was!! When I arrived in Bruxelles, it was gloomy and misting. Not the way I wanted to start the weekend. The weather stayed the same all weekend. That did not stop the fun.\n\nSpending the weekend in Brussels was totally worth the waffles! The sugar definitely made me bounce off the walls. #belgium #worldtravel #unkstudyabroad A post shared by Pablo Morales (@pablo.morales1) on Mar 19, 2017 at 9:55am PDT\n\nWe checked out many popular attractions throughout the city. There was so much we saw, I started to lose my mind a bit. One of the coolest places I saw was a \u201cWorld Shop.\u201d They had souvenirs and artsy things from all around the world. I was so intrigued with the place that I ended up buying a few things from there.\n\nThe other purpose of coming to Bruxelles was to meet up with our friend Kellie and Sammy\u2019s brother, Louis. It was good to see some other friends from back home. I missed those two! Kellie is just a keeper, to keep a long story short. These two are actually on Spring Break right now. I am so jealous of you guys spending your holiday in Malta! I hope you enjoy every second of it!\n\nBruxelles treated everyone well!\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\nThese last few weekends have been pretty awesome! It was good to see a few friends from back home. I couldn\u2019t of asked for a better time. Traveling becomes more exciting when you are hanging out with people you know and love. I can\u2019t wait for the next adventure with them! So, is it sprangggg breakkk yet? I wish!", "label": "personal"}

{"title": "Pablo Morales", "url": "https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/published:2017", "content": "en\n\nBeing away from home these last few months have been great. I enjoy the freedoms, living independently and eating good food whenever I want. Life has treated me good here. Until more recently, a certain stage of being away finally starts. Lately, homesickness has really started to kick in. I\u2019ve really started to miss my friends, family and things I really took for granted back home. It really is bad when I am craving my mom\u2019s homemade food. (Mexican Food.) Midterms and all the studying is really killing my vibe at this point of the semester. My program is not your typical study abroad program that you go away for 3 months (not to mention that it doesn\u2019t even apply to your major) on a semi vacation. I actually have to try real hard as my french studies here in Strasbourg France will help me graduate next year. Enough bashing.\n\nWith all this, one just feels that they are slowly losing control. Sure I am enjoying myself out here in France but still there is this emptiness of something that I have been away from for far too long. Hopefully, I hope some sort of enlightenment will come bring me back to life. Then It hit me, I would see my friends in just a few weeks. I honestly couldn\u2019t believe in such short time I would be right in front of them.\n\nSo I would be meeting up my good friend Sammy and soon-to-be friend Mitch. They have never been to Europe before, so I figured why not show them around Paris, a city that I know decently and use my French to get to Point A to Point B and of course with the help of good ol\u2019 Google Maps. Paris- Weekend 1\n\nThese guys had a hell of a time getting to Paris during the 24 hours before arrival. I\u2019ll let them explain that one.\n\nSo I picked the guys up from Charles De Gaulle Aiport. I still feel bad on making you guys wait for me. :/ I ran up to my dude Sammy and gave him a bro hug! It has been way to long since I have seen that dude! I also got to meet Mitch and got to know him more through out the weekend. Cool Dude! So I showed them around Paris. To be honest, Paris is beautiful with history written all around. As with any major city, Paris is no exception, it is dirty and smelly. I really hope that the guys did not have too high of hopes for the \u201cCity of Love.\u201d Paris is overrated in my opinion but why not take advantage of leaving Strasbourg for a few days.\n\nSo we went to various monuments such as The Louvre, Arc of Triumph, Versailles and so much more. Many of the places were breath taking. The Eiffel Tour is always a good place to scope out as well as walking along the Seine River. Getting around Paris is no piece of cake but we managed. Never have I ever gone up so many round staircases. Climbing the Cathedral of Notre Dame was such a struggle. Whenever you are in Europe, walking is really the way to get around.\n\nNight life in Paris is pretty popping! We went to a few clubs in the Grand Boulevard District! This district did not disappoint. I wish we could have checked out a few other ones. One of my favorite places was the Irish Pub. Music, dancing, girls and drinks. Man was that a fun night!\n\nWe ate some good food throughout Paris. The guys had their first legit French Croissants and baguette sandwich. It\u2019s totally acceptable to have a sandwich on you at all times. I also had them try one of my favorites, a kebab sandwich. Man are they delicious! Sammy had actual ramen noodles for the first time ever! Overall we pretty much stuffed our faces all weekend.\n\nBruxelles- Weekend 2\n\nAh Bruxelles!! The place known for its deliciouos fries and waffles. You have no idea how much I stuffed my face this weekend. Just writing this post makes my mouth water. Was eating all this food this worth it? You bet it was!! When I arrived in Bruxelles, it was gloomy and misting. Not the way I wanted to start the weekend. The weather stayed the same all weekend. That did not stop the fun.\n\nSpending the weekend in Brussels was totally worth the waffles! The sugar definitely made me bounce off the walls. #belgium #worldtravel #unkstudyabroad A post shared by Pablo Morales (@pablo.morales1) on Mar 19, 2017 at 9:55am PDT\n\nWe checked out many popular attractions throughout the city.

Getting the insights from another teacher lets you have a feeling of what its like to be in the classroom. Enjoy the interview! I will have the audio podcast available soon! Click here to download a copy of the document to your device.\n\nDenise Teetor: ESL at Hastings Senior High School\n\nInterviewed by\n\nPablo MORALES GARCIA\n\nMrs. Denise Teetor is an English as a Second Language Teacher at Hastings Senior High School in Hastings Nebraska. She has been teaching at the high school for more than 30 years. She has quite a different perspective of the world since she has traveled outside of the United States plenty of times. She has seen so many changes in ESL over the years. She has quite the story to tell in which she becomes the ESL teacher she is today.\n\nMrs. Teetor was not an ESL teacher from the beginning. She use to teach physical education and coach for a long time. She decided to pursue a different area of teaching and left behind being an PE teacher and decided to teach English in Japan. She wanted to do something different with her time during the summers instead of wasting it. She saw an advertisement to teach in Japan for six weeks and thought \u201cthat sounds pretty cool\u201d, and that\u2019s how she got involved with Japan. She really enjoyed it and had so much fun with it.\n\nAfter one summer, she decided to pursue her ESL endorsements. She was thinking ahead that she could teach ESL at the high school level at some point down the road. One summer as she was getting ready to go back to Japan, she knew that the ELL teacher at Hastings High would be leaving that summer, even though she had not filed her resignation letter. Mrs. Teetor took some steps before the other teacher quit. She let the school know that she was interested in the position. The teacher did end up leaving and she received a phone call asking if she was interested in the ELL position and she said \u201cYes\u201d. This is how she moved from physical education to ELL. Japan really peaked her interest working with foreign kids.\n\nShe is happy with how much ESL/ELL has evolved over the years, especially since she saw there was not a lot of curriculum that existed. The number of students has changed over the years. The program development has come a long way. There was curriculum that really existed. They were fortunate when they were able to find books related to ELL/ESL. Now there are whole curriculums that one can use. That has been an advancement of ELL programs. It is like all other curriculums in schools such as science where you have books, notebooks and a foundation to use. You start at the foundational levels and move through the different stages of it. It has been one of the biggest tools available so teachers don\u2019t have to go out and make their own material.\n\nShe describes the program at Hastings Senior High School. She gets all different levels of ESL students in each class period. She explains that in an ideal world, students are grouped by their level such as all level 1 students are together, level 2 are together, and so forth. Unfortunately, she doesn\u2019t have that luxury at the high school. She works with each level of students individually so each group of students can be differentiated as needed. She splits the groups up between her and Mrs. Brenneman, the para educator, to help each leveled group. The program at HHS is not a program that is like those implemented in other schools. The program isn\u2019t a dual language or other type. They just work based on the situation they have or a melting pot as she states. She is very proud of the graduation rate that has increased. If the kids start with the program, they tend to finish with the program unless they move away. She is proud that the ELL students have been able to take all the required classes or core classes needed to graduate. Even though they might not have a high level of English, \u201cthey do pretty well\u201d. Even though teachers provide differentiation, they learn all the same material as regular students. The students are able to get into the classroom right away. This is good for them since they can get \u201creal world\u201d experience and immerse themselves in the culture and listen to how students talk. No one ever follows grammar rules when the speak.\n\nMrs. Teetor mentions that students have to take a test to see if they need ESL services based on responses on intake forms when transferring into the district. She uses the newly implemented ELPA to screen prospective and current students who might or are using ESL services to measure their level of English. Newly arriving students fill out a questionnaire that askes the language they spoke first, what language is spoken primarily at home, and what language they want to be communicated with. If any of these are not English, they need to be tested. Even though a student knows English, they still have to take the test if their language spoken at home is not English. She uses a computer screener test. Anyone that is four (4) or above, they do not need to be in the program but anything below that, students should be enrolled in ESL/ELL. Things are done differently at the elementary level compared to the high school level.\n\nMrs. Teetor works closely with other teachers. She also likes to know what the teachers are teaching so she can meet the needs of students such as preparing a presentation or report. With American History, the students have no background especially with the foreign students. American history pertains to the United States. Math is math, science is science, these things are the same all the way across cultures. She enjoys how things are taught at HHS. Students are in ELL for at least 2 class periods. She tells us about an example student who doesn\u2019t speak a lot of but is very bright. Looking at her transcripts, she is a very well-rounded person. She has taken courses in psychology to advanced math. She was top of her class before moving. This student is \u201cbrilliant\u201d, according to Mrs. Teetor. She sees how this student can feel out of place due to the language barrier. She sees another barrier with math leaning towards story-problems. It intimidates students since it involves reading instead of involving direct math problems. What is truly moving is that she truly advocates for students to get them in the regular classroom where they will have to think, perform in the real thing. She knows it will be hard but it would be a \u201cdisservice\u201d if she does not.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t faced any teachers who have rejected or negated students. This at least hasn\u2019t occurred during her time her but she says that \u201cit might have happened before I started.\u201d She believes this hasn\u2019t happened because of her strong personality and she knows the teachers will be supportive at Hastings Senior High School. She hopes that the next person who replaces her will continue on standing up for the students. She also knows which teachers will be best for her students and she know the teachers who will not be a good fit. She moves students as necessary to put them in the right classrooms. She would rather do something else with the student if the teacher is not a good fit for the students. For a new teacher, this is something that he or she will not know and this will take time to figure out. She is hopeful the other teacher will be the best advocate for the ESL students.\n\nShe has great advice for new ESL teachers especially for the teacher replacing her. The best advice would be just to have fun with these students. They do need to learn but also everything is not so rigid that they can\u2019t enjoy. Simply cramming information gets them discouraged. It has been interested and fun for them to know. Everyone has some kid within each other. We need to promote this with the kids. She gets a lot out of the kids when they have fun. If they are sitting bored, they are not going anywhere. This is her overall advice.\n\nThank you, Mrs. Teetor for allowing me to interview you. It was such a great insight of ESL and very helpful for me for my future career as an ESL Teacher. I wish you the best in luck with retirement and hope to hear about your adventures in Japan! Cheers!\n\nA podcast of this will be available on my SoundCloud page soon!", "label": "personal"}

He has come a long way from living in Wyoming to going to school in Nebraska. He decided to take a different route and packed his things and moved to Los Angeles. I am really excited for the great things he is doing to become \"\"different\"\" and not living a normal life. He tells us about his journey and some tips to do more in life. I see great things for you Jack!\n\nPablo: Jack tell me about yourself?\n\nJack: Where to start? My name is Jack Corbett, 22 years old. I am from Madison, WI. I've always been a kid who has been in love with sports his whole life. The only thing I really wanted to do was to play football in NFL. That all changed when I got a concussion after my third year in college playing football. Things really changed after this. The concussion was very eye opening for me. I felt so messed up and out if it. I decided to take another route after football.\n\nP: What gave you that spark to get you into music?\n\nJ: When I was in high school I took a Hip-Hop class studies. I did a freestyle rap in class on the spot. Alongside I had used a beat production program, also referred as a digital audio workstation. Everyone had to present and the class had to pick their favorite beat that they liked. They ended up choosing mine. Everyone really seemed to love it! It got me super pumped. The feedback I got was good. Music is about impressing your fans. Might as well do it and I just love it. That\u2019s simply how it is. At first when starting out, I did not take music production seriously. I had always wanted to be different in how I wanted my life to be \u201cHow could I be different from the typical 9 to 5 lifestyle?\u201d Music was the way to go to do this. I turned this around and I created an independent record label, [NAME?] Records.\n\nJ: I started modeling when I got to to Los Angeles. I decided to do an open call audition for Maverick Modeling in LA. After I had done my audtion, they were interested in me but I needed to fix a few things to get things going. They wanted me to get more in shape. I had to workout quite a bit and check in with them every week for 4 weeks. Then it really worked out.\n\nP: What kind of modeling or related jobs have you had so far?\n\nJ: Oh, man! I've had a few jobs so far! I've been doing stuff with H&M, commercials, print & digital publications and some things in YouTube. Everything counts! I've had so much fun!\n\nP: How did you build contacts and/or clients?\n\nJ: The agency handles modeling projects (business aspect) for me to do. I hired a photographer that I met through a few friends. [She] is from London. I have met people from back home. You meet so many people in LA. Making beats, you get to know other people as well. I have met with a new group of rappers called FRIO. I have also made friends with Ponts De Leon. He is really making it out here. I got to hangout in his studio. Then I checked out Altrium Sudios and met label executive, Quincy Howard. I've been back there a few times with some rapper friends and Quincy has been there every time. Through meeting him and liking my vibe. I got an interview to be an intern. Today is my third day here. I am really loving every minute of it I'm grateful for all of the people I've met so far.\n\nP: What was the biggest challenge moving to this new place that you call home?\n\nJ: My biggest challenge would be financials. Everything out here is just much more expensive in every aspect Getting to LA was something else I rode for 30 hours in about 2 days. I had around 10 hours of rest before I had to start my new job Monday morning. Now I have a car. I didn\u2019t have a car for six months. I made it though LA was a bit shocking for me. It was over stimulating to be here at first. It's just different from what I was used to.\n\nP: What gave you the motivation to stay with it?\n\nJ: There would be a lot of days just sitting in your room. It is really hard to stay motivated. I love producing music! Sometimes I would be bored out of my mind not being able to show anyone my beats. It is seriously a good time even if I am by myself. At the same time, It is addicting like a video game. Sometimes I can't stop. As you get better, it is all about time. More people start to notice once you start getting better. I have so much more fun when I feel confident that I am getting better.\n\nP: Did you have any doubts in your mind that you were not going to be successful?\n\nJ: Everyone has lots of ups and down that they face. You never know when something crazy might happen!? A variety of things can make you question yourself. Things like when no one is buying your beats or not getting calls for audtions. Football has taught me to work hard. I just don't give up! I can't. .\"", "label": "personal"}

She uses a computer screener test. Anyone that is four (4) or above, they do not need to be in the program but anything below that, students should be enrolled in ESL/ELL. Things are done differently at the elementary level compared to the high school level.\n\nMrs. Teetor works closely with other teachers. She also likes to know what the teachers are teaching so she can meet the needs of students such as preparing a presentation or report. With American History, the students have no background especially with the foreign students. American history pertains to the United States. Math is math, science is science, these things are the same all the way across cultures. She enjoys how things are taught at HHS. Students are in ELL for at least 2 class periods. She tells us about an example student who doesn\u2019t speak a lot of but is very bright. Looking at her transcripts, she is a very well-rounded person. She has taken courses in psychology to advanced math. She was top of her class before moving. This student is \u201cbrilliant\u201d, according to Mrs. Teetor. She sees how this student can feel out of place due to the language barrier. She sees another barrier with math leaning towards story-problems. It intimidates students since it involves reading instead of involving direct math problems. What is truly moving is that she truly advocates for students to get them in the regular classroom where they will have to think, perform in the real thing. She knows it will be hard but it would be a \u201cdisservice\u201d if she does not.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t faced any teachers who have rejected or negated students. This at least hasn\u2019t occurred during her time her but she says that \u201cit might have happened before I started.\u201d She believes this hasn\u2019t happened because of her strong personality and she knows the teachers will be supportive at Hastings Senior High School. She hopes that the next person who replaces her will continue on standing up for the students. She also knows which teachers will be best for her students and she know the teachers who will not be a good fit. She moves students as necessary to put them in the right classrooms. She would rather do something else with the student if the teacher is not a good fit for the students. For a new teacher, this is something that he or she will not know and this will take time to figure out. She is hopeful the other teacher will be the best advocate for the ESL students.\n\nShe has great advice for new ESL teachers especially for the teacher replacing her. The best advice would be just to have fun with these students. They do need to learn but also everything is not so rigid that they can\u2019t enjoy. Simply cramming information gets them discouraged. It has been interested and fun for them to know. Everyone has some kid within each other. We need to promote this with the kids. She gets a lot out of the kids when they have fun. If they are sitting bored, they are not going anywhere. This is her overall advice.\n\nThank you, Mrs. Teetor for allowing me to interview you. It was such a great insight of ESL and very helpful for me for my future career as an ESL Teacher. I wish you the best in luck with retirement and hope to hear about your adventures in Japan!

Getting the insights from another teacher lets you have a feeling of what its like to be in the classroom. Enjoy the interview! I will have the audio podcast available soon! Click here to download a copy of the document to your device.\n\nDenise Teetor: ESL at Hastings Senior High School\n\nInterviewed by\n\nPablo MORALES GARCIA\n\nMrs. Denise Teetor is an English as a Second Language Teacher at Hastings Senior High School in Hastings Nebraska. She has been teaching at the high school for more than 30 years. She has quite a different perspective of the world since she has traveled outside of the United States plenty of times. She has seen so many changes in ESL over the years. She has quite the story to tell in which she becomes the ESL teacher she is today.\n\nMrs. Teetor was not an ESL teacher from the beginning. She use to teach physical education and coach for a long time. She decided to pursue a different area of teaching and left behind being an PE teacher and decided to teach English in Japan. She wanted to do something different with her time during the summers instead of wasting it. She saw an advertisement to teach in Japan for six weeks and thought \u201cthat sounds pretty cool\u201d, and that\u2019s how she got involved with Japan. She really enjoyed it and had so much fun with it.\n\nAfter one summer, she decided to pursue her ESL endorsements. She was thinking ahead that she could teach ESL at the high school level at some point down the road. One summer as she was getting ready to go back to Japan, she knew that the ELL teacher at Hastings High would be leaving that summer, even though she had not filed her resignation letter. Mrs. Teetor took some steps before the other teacher quit. She let the school know that she was interested in the position. The teacher did end up leaving and she received a phone call asking if she was interested in the ELL position and she said \u201cYes\u201d. This is how she moved from physical education to ELL. Japan really peaked her interest working with foreign kids.\n\nShe is happy with how much ESL/ELL has evolved over the years, especially since she saw there was not a lot of curriculum that existed. The number of students has changed over the years. The program development has come a long way. There was curriculum that really existed. They were fortunate when they were able to find books related to ELL/ESL. Now there are whole curriculums that one can use. That has been an advancement of ELL programs. It is like all other curriculums in schools such as science where you have books, notebooks and a foundation to use. You start at the foundational levels and move through the different stages of it. It has been one of the biggest tools available so teachers don\u2019t have to go out and make their own material.\n\nShe describes the program at Hastings Senior High School. She gets all different levels of ESL students in each class period. She explains that in an ideal world, students are grouped by their level such as all level 1 students are together, level 2 are together, and so forth. Unfortunately, she doesn\u2019t have that luxury at the high school. She works with each level of students individually so each group of students can be differentiated as needed. She splits the groups up between her and Mrs. Brenneman, the para educator, to help each leveled group. The program at HHS is not a program that is like those implemented in other schools. The program isn\u2019t a dual language or other type. They just work based on the situation they have or a melting pot as she states. She is very proud of the graduation rate that has increased. If the kids start with the program, they tend to finish with the program unless they move away. She is proud that the ELL students have been able to take all the required classes or core classes needed to graduate. Even though they might not have a high level of English, \u201cthey do pretty well\u201d. Even though teachers provide differentiation, they learn all the same material as regular students. The students are able to get into the classroom right away. This is good for them since they can get \u201creal world\u201d experience and immerse themselves in the culture and listen to how students talk. No one ever follows grammar rules when the speak.\n\nMrs. Teetor mentions that students have to take a test to see if they need ESL services based on responses on intake forms when transferring into the district. She uses the newly implemented ELPA to screen prospective and current students who might or are using ESL services to measure their level of English. Newly arriving students fill out a questionnaire that askes the language they spoke first, what language is spoken primarily at home, and what language they want to be communicated with. If any of these are not English, they need to be tested. Even though a student knows English, they still have to take the test if their language spoken at home is not English. She uses a computer screener test. Anyone that is four (4) or above, they do not need to be in the program but anything below that, students should be enrolled in ESL/ELL. Things are done differently at the elementary level compared to the high school level.\n\nMrs. Teetor works closely with other teachers.

These posts will be interactive on my website (https://lifeofpablo.com) . I am in the process of rebuilding my website so stay tuned.\n\nHere I am in South Korea getting a snack at a convenience store. Everytime I go to one, I reflect on convenience stores back in the United States. Convenience stores in the United States are usually gas stations at the same time. Living in California you see convenience stores as standalone locations more often. Convenience stores back home get a bad wrap because they sell not so healthy food or are simply over priced. It's not so much in Korea. Yes, there are things that are overpriced but not as bad as you would see in the United States. Korean Convenience Stores are a whole different experience..\n\n\u2665\ufe0fKOREA IS LIVING IN THE FUTURE\u2665\ufe0f\n\nCommon convenience stores are GS25, Nice to CU and 7/11. They are all over the place. It's hard not to walk from one corner of a block to another corner of the same block without passing a convenience store. This is pretty consistent in most of Korea. The cities of Seoul and Chuncheon are good examples. Two or three years since the pandemic, many did stay open pretty late or open 24 hours. They are just there whenever you need something. You can buy a snack, a beer (or many), toiletries and more! I've even found socks after my shoes got soaked in the rain. Prices are not overly expensive taking in consideration that the exchange rate between USD and WON are in the favor of the American consumer such as myself.\n\nThe experience at every convenience store is different. You never know what you'll find. I'm not sure how it is decided on what is carried in each store. I do love the element of surprise.\n\nKorean Convenience Stores will fill the void in many aspects of life. They are considered important in Korean Culture and Socialization. You'll often find tables inside and outside of the store. I find it hard to find a normal bar establishment. Even if I did find a bar, it could be expensive or hard to get into. Convenience Stores are a meeting point to socialize especially if there is seating available at the location you visit. I really enjoy getting a beer or a few with friends and just talk about our day, our hopes & desires, and just having tipy conversations. I've had some really deep moments here with others. One of my favorite moments was finding a convenience store in a large park and making my ramen right then and there!\n\nWhat really shocked me was the Seoul WorldCup Stadium when I went to a soccer match. There I found a GS25 with prices similar to one you find on a random street.\n\nOverall, I'm happy with convenience stores here! I sure will miss them!\n\nI will share this information in a lesson in the near future with others.\n\nHere are my favorite items I get from the convenience store:\n\nSmall pack of coffee\n\nA cup of ice - use it for any drink you need to make cold (or colder.)\n\nGimbap\n\nBeer\n\nRam\n\nSnacks such as fried\n\nRamen\n\nWhat is nice about convenience stores is being able to cook instant ramen in-store seconds right after you buy it.\n\nSnacks\n\nThere are so many options.

{"title": "My #introduction on Mastodon", "url": "https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/my-introduction-on-mastodon", "content": "My #introduction on Mastodon\n\nThis post was written in English (en_US).\n\nPablo joined Mastodon!\n\nWe all know the news of the fire storm that is happening with Twitter and lighter fluid known as Elon Musk is throwing at it.\n\nMastodon is a social media service that is free. It pretty much acts like twitter with the same functionality but the name of the functions are named differently.\n\npost \"toots\" (instead of tweets),\n\nfollow other people and organizations,\n\nfavorite (like) and\n\nboost (retweet) posts from other people.\n\nI decided to join the community and so far I am enjoying it. When I mean joined, I actually created my own Mastodon instance on my server. More on this later. So for I am loving the decentralized platform and being able to control various aspects to it. My first experience with federation was the use of OwnCloud and its variants such as NextCloud. This concept has been around for quite some time.\n\nI chose to host my own instance because I like my domain (lifeofpablo.com) and it gave me an opportunity to learn how to manage an instance and learn how to be a user as well. It's been a great experience. If there is question or something I don't know I visit the Mastodon Documentation . This where the instructions are located to install your own instance. The key to installing your own instance is making sure Node.js is setup correctly on your server. It's pretty straight forward.\n\nMy Instance Setup:\n\nBack-End Domain Setup: https://social.lifeofpablo.com\n\nMy username pablo [at] pablolifeofpablo.com Please follow me \ud83d\ude00\n\nInstall using Mastodon Documentation Front-End Single User Mode (Just Me) At this time no registrations (Please follow me!)\n\nI love that i can use my main domain as the communicative user domain.\n\nGoals:\n\nBackground I would like to use Mastodon and the oAuth (used for login system) as a way to build apps, not necessarily clients. These apps would be an extension to my Mastodon instance. I'd use the login system to login to these apps to pull and use data. Steps Use Mastodon as backend for authentication\n\nBuild Node.js app using Mastodon (oAuth) as a login system for an internal app. A tutorial I found for good foundation\n\nCreate a dashboard where I can see metrics, trends, push system wide notifications, server maintenance, etc. Essentially a backend management.\n\nMove many of the administration features to the dashboard with the option of allowing features to be available.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt's been great getting to use Mastodon on the server-side and as a user. I see a great future for Mastodon and other decentralized, federated services (and other terminology) out there.\n\nI'm sure my goals/vision will grow on what I can do with my Mastodon instance. I know I will eventually migrate and upgrade server resources such as RAM, storage, processing power. I also need to make sure I concious about how much energy and being carbon neutral or carbon negative.\n\nIntroduction Post", "label": "personal"}

These posts will be interactive on my website (https://lifeofpablo.com) . I am in the process of rebuilding my website so stayed tuned.\n\nMy name is Pablo Morales. I used to teach within Omaha Public Schools but now I teach in Sacramento, CA. I still teach French & Spanish to middle schoolers.\n\nI have always been a fan of public transportation! Within the United States, commuting to work seems painfully dreadful. We are a nation dominated by cars and bad policies. Our public transportation infrastructure is not good for a very \u201cdeveloped\u201d country. Our roads are suffering, and everything else in-between isn\u2019t pleasant either. This isn't the case in South Korea. I'm only a week or so in since arriving in South Korea. I am absolutely M-I-N-D blown on what I am seeing and hearing.. My brain can't handle this!\n\nCommuting in Seoul, Korea is not about trying to catch your bus or train, you are there for the experience of being in a station. You're probably wondering, \"Pablo, Isn't the topic over public transportation\u2026.you know boring?\" I say, \"Absolutely Not!\" I've been to multiple cities who don't even come close to the Korean experience of public transportation. My favorite part about using the Seoul Metro System is that you get to hear all the cute and relaxing rings and jingles offered at all metro stations and some bus stations.\n\nCommuting is hard on the body when traveling far. It's hot and humid out, or you're just simply tired. Those little jingles give you a glimmer of hope that you are getting closer to your final destination. You stay motivated instead of only hearing the usual \"This train is departing.\" or departing. It brightens the mood. My two favorite jingles or sounds are: The Trumpet Link A steelpan Link Do you see what I mean? It definitely made me smile. Everyone seems so happy. I knew traveling within Seoul was going to be fun but who knew these little jingles are what make the experience of the metro in Seoul.\n\nHere is a handpicked few of my favorite jingles. Not all are in circulation at the moment.\n\nLink\n\nLink\n\nBeing a minority in the US and still being a minority in South Korea.\n\nSomeone who speaks 3 different languages.

Education has been ingrained in me I was the first to graduate in my family from university. I studied to become a public school teacher. I became a public school teacher early in my career. I taught during the COVID pandemic during my first year of becoming a public school teacher.\n\nPublic school education is important to me.\n\nIt makes me sad to see what Nebraska, my home state, has become regarding public education. Now that I live in California, I feel, indirectly, I am standing on the sidelines seeing how my home-sate wants to divert public funds or public taxes to fund private institutions. We live in a time where we can't properly fund, nor respect our own public schools across the nation. The de-funding public schools has been in the works as far back as the 1980s. Other efforts happened before this as well. This has been most predominantly since the Reagan Administration. The Reagan Administration slashed funding for public education across the board.\n\nIt's embarrassing we are trying to divert money from a great public school system from the State of Nebraska as it ranks one of the highest in the nation. I myself am a product of a Nebraska Public Education. We need to fix the issues happening, not make the problems worse.\n\nWhy should we fund private institutions? Why should we fund religious public institutions? Shouldn't we have separation of church and state? Public funds should stay in public schools. It's like they are trying to make a problem worse? Why keep under funding the public school system?\n\nNone of the private schools in my hometown, offered the subjects I was interested. I lived not too far from a Catholic school. They offered the \"bare minimum.\" They didn't offer other world languages beyond Spanish. They didn't offer auto mechanics or other trades (attending trade school is just as important as university. This is discussion for another time.) What is the likelihood of them expanding their programs?\n\nMany counties in Nebraska don't even have private institutions. How is the state going to give private institutions money to education students when the facilities don't exist? Here's a news report\n\nPrivate education will increase inequality.\n\nPublic schools have been there for everyone. No matter your socioeconomic status. It was there for me. Public schools are there to help the most disadvantaged.\n\nI agree, with the phrase, \"Society is cheaping out on the kids\" as written by Tracy Durnell, \"We must fight the privatisation of school to provide racial equity, class mobility, and teaching reality instead of \u2018alternative facts.\" We need to invest in students and not let them down.\n\nHow the State Currently get funding\n\nNebraska Public Media does a great job, visually of reporting how schools are funded in Nebraska.\n\nGraphic from Nebraska Public Media: Nebraska relies heavily on property taxes to fund its public schools, compared to other states. (Graphic courtesy of OpenSky Policy Institute, uses 2019-2020 data\n\nMore state funding on the way for public schools in Nebraska\n\nAdding funding to public schools is only one piece of the puzzle, we need to also address the systems, bureaucracies, institutions, and bad polices that exist, past and present.\n\nI don't like to be cynical, I am scared what is coming. People need to become informed in what is happening in their community. People need to read the bills introduced in their respective level of government.

In this example I will be using IndieAuth as our provider using a very minimal configuration.\n\nThis tutorial assumes you have prior knowledge of using a linux server such as Debian.

Every request is checked by VP to ensure that it is valid.\n\nVP can send the visitor's email, name and other information which the IdP provides (including access tokens) to the web application as HTTP headers. VP can be used to replace application user management entirely. In our case, we are passing an HTTP header with your domain to sign into sites that support indieauth protocol.\n\nAn example of an HTTP header being passed is my domain, https://lifeofpablo.com.\n\nThings you'll need/prepare:\n\nA linux server with a public IP address with hosting and SSL Debian will be used here but any of the common distros will work Certbot is an easy solution to get SSL certifcate for https://\n\nGo Language (to compile vouch-proxy)\n\nVouch Proxy\n\nMake sure your website is setup for use with the Indieauth protocol.\n\nNginx Web Server\n\nDigital Ocean has a good guide if you need to learn how to setup virtual blocks in nginx.\n\nDownload/Install Vouch Proxy from Github\n\nMake sure to have Go Lang installed. Follow the instructions for your operating system. In my case I am using debian.\n\nDownload Vouch Proxy from it's Github repository.\n\n$ git clone https://github.com/vouch/vouch-proxy.git $ cd vouch-proxy $ ./do.sh goget $ ./do.sh build\n\nVouch Proxy Nginx Virtual Block\n\nLet's go ahead and create a virtual block to proxy Vouch Proxy.\n\nserver { server_name vouch.domain.com; location / { proxy_set_header Host $http_host ; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https; proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9090; } }\n\nLet's go ahead and create a virtual block for a regular nginx website site or edit an existing virtual block. This is the website/service that you will protect with Vouch Proxy.\n\nIn this example I am using a php web app. If you a non php site site to work you can remove this location block and and edit it to your needs.\n\nVouch Proxy config with Indieauth.com as a service provider.\n\nModify your config.yml\n\nThis will get you going, I have added some of my personal settings such as public access. Public access allows people to access your \"protected app\" without needing to login until you need them to login. Here are some options in how you can allow people to use your app. It is important to align the config in the config.yml file. Even an extra space can cause Vouch Proxy to fail. More on that in the next section.\n\nOptions\n\nYou can allow public access to the site but only allow everyone the option to sign into the website with a basic PHP script or use the corresponding http_header to use the website/web app to authenticate . Comment out or delete the line, \"allowAllUsers: true\" and include the line,\" publicAccess: true\" .\n\nYou can allow public access to the site but only allow certain people, (or in this case, domains) actually sign into the website. Comment out or delete the line, \"allowAllUsers: true\" and include the line,\" publicAccess: true\" .\n\nYou can force everyone to sign in before seeing the website but still allow everyone to access the website. Include the \"allowAllUsers: true\" and comment out or delete the line,,\" publicAccess: true\" .\n\n\n\nvouch: logLevel: debug listen: 0.0 .0 .0 port: 9090 allowAllUsers: true cookie: secure: false domain: lifeofpablo.com publicAccess: true oauth: provider: indieauth client_id: https://lifeofpablo.com auth_url: https://indieauth.com/auth callback_url: https://auth.lifeofpablo.com/auth\n\nRun/test your Vouch Proxy configuration.\n\nRun the following command\n\nnohup ./vouch-proxy -loglevel debug > vouch.log 2>&1 &\n\nIt should display a process ID (PID)\n\n[1] 53310\n\nHit enter. If no error or exit code displays, Vouch proxy is running!\n\nIf there is an error, it will exit such as the example below.\n\n[1]+ Exit 126 nohup ./vouch-proxy -loglevel debug > vouch.log 2>&1\n\nIf there is an error, make sure your there is not weird spacing or errors in the configuration. If you are sure that you have the information correct, use the examples provided by Vouch Proxy and copy and paste the example to get the formatting correct. Adjust the configuration as needed to match your needs.\n\nNginx Virtual block protected by Vouch Proxy\n\nserver { listen 80 ; listen [::]: 80 ; root /root/to/web/directory; index index.php index.html; server_name secretapp.example.com; location / { try_files $uri $uri / /index.php $is_args $args ; } client_max_body_size 100m ; location ~* \\.php$ { try_files $uri = 404 ; fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.2-fpm.sock; include fastcgi.conf; fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\\.php)(/.+)$ ; fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root $fastcgi_script_name ; fastcgi_param REMOTE_USER $auth_user ; } auth_request /vouch-validate; location = /vouch-validate { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9090/validate; proxy_set_header Content-Length \"\" ; proxy_set_header Host $http_host ; proxy_set_header Remote-User $auth_user ; proxy_pass_request_body off ; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr ; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for ; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme ; auth_request_set $auth_resp_jwt $upstream_http_x_vouch_jwt ; auth_request_set $auth_resp_err $upstream_http_x_vouch_err ; auth_request_set $auth_resp_failcount $upstream_http_x_vouch_failcount ; } auth_request_set $auth_user $upstream_http_x_vouch_user ; location = /logout { return 302 https://vouch.domain.com/logout?url= $scheme :// $http_host ; } error_page 401 = @error401 ; location @error401 { return 302 https://vouch.domain.com/login?url=https:// $http_host $request_uri &vouch-failcount= $auth_resp_failcount &X-Vouch-Token= $auth_resp_jwt &error= $auth_resp_err ; } }\n\nEventually you will need to secure your site with SSL/TLS that makes your site use https://. More than ever, your traffic should be secure with using it as 0auth as the method used to sign in to your protected website(s).\n\nDo this after you have the server blocks working in the following section.\n\nHere is the link for Certbot for Debian. I have tested this on Debian 10 & 11. [https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=nginx&os=debianbuster](Link for Certbot)\n\nCertbot can do this for you as long as you have the subdomain in your DNS pointing to your machine and have cert bot installed. It'll add these blocks in your server blocks automatically.\n\nIt'll look similar to this . Certbot will rearrange and add a few things.\n\nserver { server_name vouch.example.com . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . listen [::]: 443 ssl; listen 443 ssl; ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/vouch.example.com/fullchain.pem; ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/vouch.example.com/privkey.pem; include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; } server { if ( $host = vouch.domain.com) { return 301 https:// $host $request_uri ; } listen 80 ; listen [::]: 80 ; server_name secretapp.example.com; return 404 ; }\n\nRepeat for every server block you'd like protect.\n\nLet's check for errors in nginx. Type the following command.\n\nsudo nginx -t\n\nYou should see something similar to this:\n\nnginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful\n\nThen restart nginx to push changes.\n\nsudo systemctl restart nginx\n\nLet's open a browser tab or window!\n\nNote: I'm using Firefox. (Preference). Any modern browser should work.\n\nDepending on your setup, you'll see a login screen or a website without login in\n\nType in the protected app' URL in the address bar Sign in with your domain (indieauth). Trigger a login later, if needed. OR Type in the protected app' URL in the address bar 2 - Trigger Login Later Trigger vouch proxy (indieauth).\n\nVoila, the protected page.\n\nHere is the home page of a Bludit CMS on subdomain acting as \"secretapp.example.com\"\n\nI will write a blog post on using it on my website and my RSS feeder. I will also go in deeper about the cookie as well.\n\nThat's it! You have setup indieauth to protect (or not your pages\n\nWant to see who's logged in?\n\nWhether you just want to see the user authenticated via the http_header or use http_header to help you authenticate into the website we can use a simple php script. We added already the other parts but here's an overview.\n\nIn your main server block, just below the line auth_request /vouch-validate; which enables the auth_request module, we added the following:\n\nauth_request_set $auth_user $upstream_http_x_vouch_user ;\n\nThis will take the HTTP header that Vouch sets, X-Vouch-User , and assign it to the nginx variable $auth_user . Then, depending on whether you use fastcgi or proxy_pass, include one of the two lines below in your server block:\n\nfastcgi_param REMOTE_USER $auth_user ; proxy_set_header Remote-User $auth_user ;\n\nThese will set an HTTP header with the value of $auth_user that your backend server can read in order to know who logged in.

I have used it one or twice through out the years. My first time being in 2015. I was so opposed or timid in the use of using Docker. I was so used to doing things the \"hard way\" otherwise known as manual install. So My friend Mani, has been showing me his Kubernetes setup and talking about Docker. I thought it was pretty rad! Just the way things flowed and how easy it is to stop and start a container. This is something he has started for a while. I hope to become well versed in this.\n\nThis leads to what is mentioned in the title of this post. I am in the process of learning to understand containers, Kubernetes, miniKube, docker and how this all ties together. I'll start with Docker and learn Kubernetes side-by-side and hope to understand. The goal is to containerize all my websites and services to keep up with the times and become a better developer.\n\nMy first successful implementation of a docker container was, wait for it..... Can you guess what it is? If you guessed Vouch Proxy! You win an cookie \ud83c\udf6a! Hooray! For the record, not a browser cookie. Those are not tasty or pleasing.\n\nIt was pretty simple once I figured out how to run the commands to adjust to my needs. I used my existing configuration file for Vouch Proxy but with some redactions. So, if you are seeing this post, or signed into my website, vouch proxy is running on docker!\n\nNext step is my website which runs on php and uses Datenstrom Yellow as the flat-file cms.\n\nI am excited for this new phase of my developer life.

I have always had an interest in taking pictures. I am one of those millennials who had a flip phone. For those who didn't have to live through this, flip phones did not have good cameras what's so ever. Phones were not all-in-one like today. So I had to bring my camera with me everywhere in my pocket or on my wrist all the time to get a good shot.\n\nPhotography has been a hobby of mine for a while. I've done it on and off throughout the years. It is a good outlet for me. It started with a point and shoot and eventually, I got nicer DSLR camera. I recently in the last two or three. years started with analog photography. Both, film photography and analog format videos. It's been fun crossing over different mediums. Photography makes me happy. I do my best to capture the moment and keep that moment alive. It is a capture of a moment of time. It's mind-blowing we can literally capture a moment and stare at it forever.\n\nIt is so much more meaningful to take it on a real camera, even if it is a simple point in shoot. It's a very intimate moment between what your capturing, the camera and most importantly - the person taking the shot.\n\nI know I'm no where being any good. I just enjoy doing this hobby. I really got to meet some cool people in the photography world. I feel proud as a teacher to have inspired one of my students to really get himself to do more photography. He has amazing shots by one-thousands times.\n\nThere are so many moments I captures that I will forever cherish. Many moments I won't show the world but maybe some day I will. Who knows? Some things are better left not reaching light.\n\nBelow are just some of my photos.

I've been eating out a bit more than I would like. I hate to say but I've been busy building new things on the web, work projects, and life overall. I'm taking a well deserved holiday soon to a place special to me in Mexico. I've been thinking how I need to cleanse and detach myself from the US food culture. I want to stay away as far from chemicals and additives. Don't get me wrong these are found in all countries, especially in processed foods.\n\nI'm excited to get some homemade food in Mexico. I'm excited for fresh ingredients from the farms and gardens in the village I am staying in. I feel that it's hard to know where your food is coming from when in the United States.\n\nThe goal is not to eat at any US-based chain fast food places or hamburgers, pizza - you know the common fast food culprits? This should be relatively easy because those are far away from the village I am staying in. Fast food has infiltrated even the most remote places. I want to indulge in so many authentic foods I don't get the chance to eat except when I am in Mexico. This is a change to reconnect with my roots, reform past relationships and find parts of me that United States culture has suppressed. Food is a good way to reconnect with lost parts of me.

I've been very fortunate to be around computers since i was three with these interactions been in school.\n\nHaving access to computers was game changing for me and has helped me. I would say I signed up for MySpace when I was ten. I know I am such a rule breaker. When I discovered personal websites, my mind exploded . . . metaphorically.\n\nCuriosity didn't kill the cat\n\nI remember when my parents upgraded from dial-up to DSL. I remember the lady at the phone company explaining all the details of the features included in our internet plan. Something that struck me was the FTP storage space. I thought, \"Wait, I can create a my website and have it hosted for free?\" This was in 2003 when I started my first personal website. I remember using basic HTML and clip art. I cringe just thinking about it. This was the stepping stone for me building and hosting websites. Using FTP was pretty advanced for an eight year old. I would stay up late just tinkering my site to make it perfect with poor HTML skills. It worked somehow?\n\nExpressing Myself\n\nI've always wanted to find ways to express myself. Since I was big into computers and tech, I figured I would use the website I built to share the things I enjoyed. I wanted to share who I was as a person. I had an idea who I was but I was still developing.\n\nInspired by others.\n\nI would look at other people who would blog and that would make me super gitty. I remember stumbling upon Matt Mullenweb back in 2003 and being inspired by him. He and many others taught me a lot about blogging. Learning by (browsing the internet) doing.\n\nBeing Resourceful.\n\nI would create new websites over the years. I couldn't afford to a pay for a website domain because I was eight years old and I wasn't going to ask my parents to spend money on something when I was more than grateful to have a computer and fast internet. I would use any free service I could until I could pay for it on my own.\n\nServices I'd use\n\nI would use a site in 2010 called Altervista where I officially used Wordpress for the first time. I made a big leap from HTML to the most popular CMS (of course I had no idea at the time). I decided this was the moment I would start expanding from a basic site to start blogging even if the posts had a few sentences. I used:\n\nAltervista\n\nDynDNS\n\nWordpress.com\n\nFreewebhosting\n\nToday\n\nOften, I really feel like that 8 year old who was discovering how to build things on the web.", "label": "personal"}

The time flew by and I made my way back home.\n\nThe last few weeks I've been reading on facial recognition. This has been a topic I've had an interest for quite some time. Our phones, our computers, and any item that had humble beginnings such as a door bell all have some form of facial recognition built in or programmed. It's weird to think about how you can unlock your phone with your face.\n\nPrivacy has become an issue with all these conveniences. Everywhere you go, your face (you as a person) is being tracked. EVERYWHERE!.\n\nSince I was traveling, I have been reading on facial recognition and the TSA\n\nAs a U.S. Citizen, I can opt out of facial recognition from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) :\n\nHere is a sign:\n\nA sign allowing U.S. citizens to opt out of facial scans.\n\nThe Experience\n\nI decided before I arrived at Los Angeles International AIrport (LAX) I decided to once I got to customs I would ask them to do a manual document check. I was already expecting them to ask me a bunch of questions. Things would either be easy or hard. I didn't want them running my face across different databases. Why should I give them more of my biometrics when they have this already?\n\nWhen I arrived at the he Customs and Border Protection Agent booth/station, I told them that I didn't want to my photo taken for facial scan. The agent went off on me. It seemed that he was shaming me for exercising my right to not have my face scanned. There were signs all over saying to inform an agent if I don't want my face scanned. This is exactly what I requested.\n\nThe Agent asked me the following questions\n\n\"Why are you doing this?\"\n\n\"Why are you making this more complicated?\"\n\n\"Do you see how many people have gone through starting this conversation?\"\n\n\"Do you that we have your facial biometics because you have a passport and driver's license?\"\n\n\"Any identity document you have is a biometric?'\n\nIt seemed that I was inconveniencing them for doing their job and providing a manual document check as my right to not to have my face scanned and verified across databases. The thing that made me mad was the intimidation tactics it seemed the agent was trying to get across. I didn't really appreciate that at all.\n\nMany of the questions the agent asked also came from the CBP Declaration Form 6059B.\n\nI was also asked where in Mexico I went, what other times I left the United States. I'm a person who provided to the point answers when asked. It's generally a good idea to provide answers not too short or answers too long either. They are law enforcement, you don't want to give unnecessary information to them either.\n\nI stood my ground. Eventually this whole ordeal was over and I moved on to collect my luggage.\n\nThe Issues\n\nThe issue I have is not the government has my biometrics, the problem I have is the how and who handles my data. This concern frightens me more when third-party companies or private companies are contracted by the government to handle this data. When other entities get involved,\n\nHow much control does a citizen have?\n\nHow much does the government actually follow up what these companies are doing with our data?\n\nHow is this information secured from hackers and kept safe?\n\nI felt so violated when I had to verify my identity for ID.me to access my IRS (Internal Revenue Service) to access my tax transcript. Why should a third party service be put in the way of accessing my government tax transcript? Why is identity verification being outsourced to a private company? The service wasn't really great at all. . It's so flawed for people of color.\n\nWe're in a Police Lineup", "label": "personal"}

One food item that always comes back with me is tlayudas.\n\nThis is a Tlayuda\n\nA tlayuda is a big tortilla tortilla that is a staple food in Oaxaca made out of corn and water. They are huge and twice the size of my head. These are no regular tortillas. This has been a food I've been eating since I was a young kid with my parents, grandparents, other relatives, and many friends. Even in moments of low funds, I have always been able to rely on these to meet my needs.\n\nOften times the tlayuda itself is the plate which you eat on. What I mean by this that often times you don't use an actual plate on the table to hold your tlayuda but the tlayuda is your plate.\n\nHow It's Eaten?\n\nThere are many ways on how you eat one but here are the ways I eat them:\n\nYou rip the tlayuda piece by piece until there is no more\n\nYou can roll it up and just starting biting into it.\n\nWhat's on this Tlayuda\n\nThis one is a simple Tlayuda. For the toppings, I used:\n\nTlayuda as the base\n\nHomemade refried beans\n\nQuesillo (Oaxacan String Cheese)\n\nChapulines (Grasshoppers). Yes, you read that correctly.\n\nWhy I Chose These Ingredients\n\nI brought back plenty of these ingredients with me from Oaxaca since I don't get to have these often or it's hard to find around here. Even when i do find them here, it doesn't have the same taste or the ingredients are old. I'm trying to eat as much of them as fast as I can.\n\nI love quesillo. Even though my body I don't agree with dairy much but quesillo is something that I never have a problem with. It probably the way it's cultured.\n\nI also haven't had much of an appetite the last few days and I haven't been craving much meat either. The chapulines provide me a substantial amount of protein and nutrients. It's common in Oaxaca to go multiple meals without eating meat. There are times where I don't eat meat for weeks at a time\n\nKeep Connected with My Roots\n\nAs a first generation Mexican-American and Oaxacan, food is important to me to help me stay connected with my culture.", "label": "personal"}

I've gone hiking here for many years since I was a kid. Exploring here gives me a sense of reconnecting with my roots. It let's me explore with no limit to what I can find or experience. It helps me be in the moment. This garden to me is infinite.\n\nIt's a beautiful place to walk through when everything is green or dry. I really admire the beauty of it. There are so many native plants surrounding me. I see the cactus, the native grasses, the carrizo (giant reed) and any plant offspring that falls on the ground.\n\nThere are so many fields of crops as well. Nature and agriculture co-existing. It's weird how well they blend in with each other.\n\nMy favorite time to enjoy the garden is sun down. All the colors are breath taking to watch and see how day becomes night. There are fun activities you can do at night time during a hike such as picking azucenas (lilies).\n\nThis is the land my ancestors lived on. I've lived on this land as well. I must continue to visit and reconnect with the people before me.\n\nNature is so beautiful. We must protect it at all costs.", "label": "personal"}

I moved away two years ago from my home state of Nebraska to the state of California. I believe it's safe to say that California is home. I've done a lot growing as a person. I am not the same person who was when I left Nebraska. I'm still growing.\n\nWhy Leave Nebraska?\n\nNebraska will forever be home. It was the place that saw me grow up. I got a great public education. It taught me how to say, \"Ope!\" and how to be a Midwestern Mexican Guy.\n\nIt's been in my mind for a while to leave. That, \"for a while\" thought has been in my mind since I was a kid. At a young age I had all these dreams and ambitions to live in various places throughout the world.\n\nI was very fortune to have visited different places in high school and in university, I got to live in France through study abroad. These experiences solidified my need to venture off more throughout the United States. Traveling abroad since I was a young kid has helped me realize there are so many great things outside of Nebraska. It's funny because I joke around how I've traveled more outside the country than in the country I reside in. I am very fortunate to have lived in Mexico for extended periods of time throughout my life.\n\nPreventing Resentment and Repeating the Mistakes of Others\n\nI've always craved so much more than the simple life back home. I didn't want to feel trapped and become resentful for lack of trying to live in and experiencing new things in new places. I see many of the people who I grew up with and reflect on my own self. I didn't want that lifestyle. So many people who I had wished had left Nebraska for greener pastures didn't leave. I didn't want to be trapped.\n\nQuestioning the Environment\n\nI've always questioned my environment. These are the questions:\n\nWhy don't we have public transportation?\n\nWhy is it weird to walk on the sidewalk in such a walk-able town?\n\nWhy are people of afraid of good change?\n\nWhy don't we think of the needs of young people who will lead the future?\n\nMy Lifestyle\n\nBeing Nebraska wasn't fitting my lifestyle anymore. I had outgrown the town of 25,000 habitants. Growing up, I never really accepted myself as a person in various degrees. I tolerated myself at best. I was smiling without actually being happy. This fa\u00e7ade of being known as, \"the guy who always has a smile on his face,\" was getting old. It was draining me for years. I truly wasn't happy. No one would ever guess that. I lost myself as an individual and I also lost who I wanted to become as individual. Looking at myself in the mirror was not a true reflection of me. I just didn't feel like anything was truly going for me. There are so many things I wish I would have addressed sooner.\n\nLeaving Nebraska was going to happen sooner than later. I had a friend nudge me a few years back to finally do it. I am grateful he nudged me enough that I felt it in my ribs.\n\nCalifornia\n\nI'm Happier as a Person\n\nI'm living in California now for two years now. Time flies!\n\nI'm a lot happier here.

Do you think about how as a person, it's hard to think about times you are truly by yourself? This has been something that has been on my mind a lot.\n\nToday, I went on a run today and drank a matcha latte at a coffee shop. It was nice just being in my thoughts and I appreciated being with myself and only myself. My mind was saying (or saying to itself?) \"This is relaxing!\"\n\nThis initiated me to start refecting on the activites I've done this year so far. I went through my phone's photo's apps, looked at my check-ins and any other history I had available. hen I started filtering out all things I've done alone and not with people. This is what I was able to recall the things I did or initiated by myself.\n\nSitting in a Coffee\n\nGoing to Noisebridge (San Francisco)\n\nGoing swimming in the river\n\nSeeing two films\n\nA few day trips?\n\nI ask myself the following questions: \"Am I not having a enough solo time?\" or \"Am I having a healthy amount of solo time?\"\n\nOften times, activites outside of home involve people in my day to day. I am not complaining about having a social circle. I just wondering for myself, \"What is a good balance?\", between activities that social and alone?\n\nAm I afraid to venture out on my own? Probably? Being at home is comfortable and I feel safe. Does my lack of knowing what is happening in my community add to this? More than likely. Does becoming a home body also play a roll.

{"title": "1000 Albums in 1000 Days", "url": "https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/one-thousand-albums-in-one-thousand-days", "content": "Sunday Morning Adventure\n\nIt was a Sunday and I was simply looking for something to do on an afternoon. Yesterday, I went to the bookstore yesterday in a long time. Going to the bookstore is a fun place to simply browse with no goal. You can simply just look and hope that something catches your eye. Oh boy! did a few things catch my eye! One book I really want to talk about is 1000 Record Covers by Michael Ors. Just as the title describes, it is a book showing different record covers. The book organized by decade (50s, 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s). It's a simple book with an record covers and a information about the record album. I inititally hesitated in purchasing this book. Then, I started thinking about my taste in music.\n\nBreaking The Loop\n\nI've been stuck in this loop of music where I listen to the same stuff over and over and over again. It's been something I've been disatisfied with myself for a while. I purchased this book not just look at all the vintage record covers, I want to expand my taste in music. So I decided to challenge myself to break away from comfortability by listening to music I don't listen to normally or never thought to listen.\n\nI am using this book as a guide to find new music. Streaming services ideally make it easy to discover new music. At the same time it seems overwhelming and distracting to even know what to discover. A book helps provide content without other distractions popping out of every direction. I also want to learn more music history throught listening which will spark my curiosity even more. I want to be able to find more ways to connect myself and see the world differently through music.\n\nThe First Album\n\nToday is Day One and we're starting at the 50's . I am listening to album Let's Go Dancing To Rock And Roll by Hen Gates And His Gaters\n\nTitle Let's Go Dancing to Rock and Roll Artist Hen Gates And His Gaters\n\nSo far, i've enjoyed it. It like the genre so far. We're off to a great start.\n\nSome limitations\n\nNot everything will be on Apple Music as I found out with Let's Go Dancing to Rock and Roll. Youtube is my next solution. That involves me making a playlist since it hasn't been organized by someone else. I won't let this discourage me but it will be challenging at times.\n\nHow long will this take?\n\nI will share my progress in listening and what I have learned so far in future blog posts, at various cyles such as various intervals. Definetly will share at albums number 250, 500, 750 and of course at 1000. According to basic math, it will take me close to 2.75 years to complete this if I do one album a day. This could either go faster or slower depending the circumstances.\n\nBuild a microsite\n\nI will create a web app or a static page that I update daily or every few days on what I am listening to from the book. It will take suggestions using webmentions and other forms of contact.\n\nThe link will come soon in an upate post.\n\nRecomendations\n\nDo any of you have any recommendations for music to listen to? Send them my way, I'd love to see what you all recommend!", "label": "personal"}

What I mean by irritable weather was facing, \"four seasons in one week.\" You're probably thinking the following: \"How is this possible?\" It simply does! If you know, you know. Here are a few examples (No particular order)\n\nOne day it can be a nice spring day with all the flowers blooming being happy as can be. The following day you could wake up to find out that there is a blizzard in effect. A few days, it could be scorching hot and wondering how we got here? The last few days of the week, it could be a beautiful, soothing fall day and you forget about the weather tragedies of earlier of the week.\n\nAs chaotic as it sounds, I do miss it. I do miss sometimes not knowing if I will melt one day or be trapped in my home for many days at a time. My favorite is knowing if my home would fly away in a tornado. As silly and boring the topic of weather is, it is also a bonding activity with people who live in this region. It's almost a pastime knowing we could just die at any minute.\n\nIf I were to pick a favorite season, it would be winter. Are you in shock? Even I don't believe it. I do miss dressing up all nice for the winter. Who doesn't like wearing cute winter outfits. If were going to suffer in the cold we might as well look our best!\n\nI moved to California to live in a different place and subconsciously to escape the cold. In Northern California it is generally just hot here all the time. I do miss having season changes. Geography and location tends to influence the type of weather or climate one lives in.\n\nYou can take the person out of the midwest but you can't take the Midwestern out of the person.\n\nAlso posted on IndieNews", "label": "personal"}
{"title": "A Letter Regarding Budget Cuts at the University of Nebraska Kearney", "url": "https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/letter-to-unk", "content": "My Letter to UNK and NU System\n\nThis week I found out that the university \"needs\" to perform a $3 million budget cut at the University of Nebraska at Kearney (UNK). This is angering and saddening. This creates a huge hole on the UNK campus. I graduated from the university in 2019. I graduated with a B.A. in Modern Languages. This hurts to hear that many programs such as the French program are being cut. The Modern Language Department was my home during my time at the University. It pushed me out of my comfort zone that led me to even great worldview experiences such as study abroad. The French program in Modern Languages helped prepare me to become a teacher and helped to interact with people of all backgrounds and cultures.\n\nUNK needs to have a complete modern language department to prepare students in this globalized world. Learning a language isn't about learning simply a language. Languages expand a person's worldview. You learn culture, you learn experiences, you learn how different societies work. We can't have young people's viewpoints and perspectives stuck glued to the environment they are in. They need to branch out. Going to college is a place where people learn to build deeper connections with others. This includes people they interact with daily and people who are different from them culturally. The modern languages department is such a vital program.\n\nWhat hurts more is the attack on the arts and humanities. The arts and humanities are important for a well rounded education. We need students to explore subjects outside of their majors. I learned a lot from the humanities and the arts.\n\nI ask the University of Nebraska not to eliminate these programs. If the entire university system wants to retain more people in Nebraska, before entering, during college, and post college, we must allow these opportunities.\n\nUNK is the only proper public university in Nebraska that geographically serves so many students in the western half of the state. UNK offers so many programs closer to home that many in years past had to attend schools further away from home to enter the programs needed.\n\nI am proud to be a graduate of the University of Nebraska at Kearney. This saddens me to see UNK and the entire university system go through this dark time. Please reconsider all the damage that is to come. Every single higher position university administrator and faculty must fight for the interest of students - current and present.\n\nRepresentatives of the Nebraska University system need to find and pressure funding from the state. The state has done so much damage from cutting budgets year after year. We must fight those who are against public education and higher education who put us in a chokehold.\n\nWe are currently facing so many attacks on public education and higher education from various places.

{"title": "Round-Up of October 2023 IndieWeb Carnival", "url": "https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/indieweb-carnival-selfcare-round-up", "content": "October is a wrap! \ud83c\udf83 I hosted October's IndieWeb Carnival on self-care. Thank you to everyone who participated in this month's IndieWeb Carnival topic. I appreciate all the responses I recieved. I recieved so many perspectives on the topic. I chose this theme as this is something I am working on improving for myself.\n\nCarnival Stats Responses 10 Happiness \u221e\n\nResponses\n\nSara Jak\u0161a - Using 4 E of Cognition to Conceptualise Self-Care\n\nI really enjoyed the way way you structured your reponse using the 4 E of cognition: embodied, embedded, extended, and enactivistic. I really appreciate the approaches using your educational background to explain. It has really helped me see things in a different perspective. I agree that self-care is \"a process to adapt my life\". One must adapt. You're right, I can't ignore self-care because whether or not I felt I was ignoring it. I was doing it whether I admit it or not. I now see it as having a low battery. It had some juice. I realize now I was also scared of myself, nervous of outcomes, and more. I realized many things. I ignored my ehealth. I really enjoy how you ended the response, \"do the self-care for the reason of your better wellbeing.\" I am doing this for myself.Thank you for being so straight foward and not beating around the bush.\n\nGrigor Malo - Should we care about self-care?\n\nI really enjoyed \"[your] answer to the prompt\" and the approach. I would agree with you some self-care/help guides do take the wrong approach. It often seems like how to appear to be fine on the outside but not actually on the inside. It's been hard in the pastto find self-care/help material related to my cultural background or for individuals who live in a multiculural life. There is no one size fits all. Hyper-individualism or individualism has been a conflicting thing for me. Why do we need to isolate ourself when things can also be experienced with other people as well. I also agree that action at the end of the day starts with the individual. \"Caring about your self is a fundamentally selfish endeavour? Not really, or at least not if practiced properly.\" That is a beautifully written phrase. I share many of the same thoughts on wellness industry and the corporate wellness. You really put in the persepective how much we buy into capitalism to feel better about ourselves.\n\nFrank Meeuwsen - Global PSC Awareness Day and selfcare\n\nFirst, I like the multilingual approach created for this post. Thank you for sharing about Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis and your experience living with this disease. I really enjoy the approach you take. With self-care you learn to see things in a positive light. I agree with \"to rest more and consciously slow down.\" This has been something I've been learning as well. It became unhealth and bad for mental health. Strecthing yourself thin is not feasible anymore. I appreciate you aspect on learning to take control of a situation. \"I know I can affect it. I know now that I can change it.\" This resonates with me so much!\n\nJeremy Cherfasi - Self-care Success\n\nI really your approach of enjoying the little and big things in life. I can agree that traveling has always been a way of self-care. A way to disconnect physically from the place one is based out of to a different environment. Self-care to you seems that you truly enjoy life and you genuinely enjoy the things you do such as biking, baking, etc. You wrote having \"a sense of purpose and of mastery\" is something I resonate with. I'm still trying to find my sense of purpose. I'm learning not to stretch myself thin an focus on the things I love. I love who you wish the drivers to take care of themselves\n\nTracy Durnell - Extending my understanding of self-care\n\nRight off the bat, your approach on the \"bigger whole\" is a like a piece of the puzzle or a train network. If any of it is missing, it simply doesn't work well. Community is so important. Unforntunately we live in a very individualistic society and we need community more than ever. \"So much of self-care is treating the symptoms rather than the source, because the source is systemic.\" I didn't think about it this way. I recently started going to therapy and I thought the goal was to get to the get to the root of the problem while hitting the symptoms like a ping pong. Thank you for sharing the books you mentioned in your response. There are so many self-care books it's hard to find where to start. I'm trying to get to the right path. Oh man, this is hits hard: \"Showing up for our friends better, sometimes that means showing up for ourselves, and sometimes it\u2019s shared.\" This makes me reflect, when I wasn't for there for myself, I wasn't there for my community in this case, my friends. If I wasn't Self-care shows that you can care for yourself and for others. This has been a year of improvement but so much I still have to reach. Thank you for sharing this perspective on community and individuals. This opened my eyes in so many ways.\n\nAnthony Ciccarello - Creating space to feel my emotions\n\nI can relate so much with Anthony's response. Right away, the second sentence, \"My natural inclination is to bury my own emotions to protect my relationships\" is very similar to what I've felt over the years. All at my expense. Bottling it all up just wears a peson down. I've been very hesitant about sharing that I've been seeing a therapist and how I've started to open up a lot more to people on what's happening in life. I really appreciate your emphasis and approach on the word, space. A space can have so many purposes. I've been learning how to use spaces inside and outside as more than being inside and outside. The space one uses can truly affect the outcomes of self-care. Spaces to think, spaces, to move, spaces to unwind, and a space to grow demonstrate healthy, safe, self-reflection and so much more.\n\nJo - Things to do offline\n\nJo does a great job at \"kill[ing] two birds with one stone\" by addressing the self-care prompt and a post I wrote on books. The response is amazing. I really like perspective on reading books. I don't discourage reading not matter the format. We live in a world where we have so many different mediums of reading. Reading away from anything that has a microchip of any kind is for me a form of reset. Just like you mentioned, sometimes the only way to get access to specific content is via digital means. Reading physical really helps reground and reconnect with the digital world. Having solo time and hanging out with people is great but a balance is necessary. You defintely don't want to go to far on the solo end or not having solo time and spending too much time with others. It's a preference in many aspects. I enjoyed your self-care activity list! I get lost with looking at vinyls at the record shop.\n\nCJ - Self-Care and Routine\n\nCJ has some great points on find things at are less \"productive-feeling.\" For the longest time, doing things like watching Netflix or go to the movies, I felt that I was wasting time and I pushed these activities away. It's been hard just to disconnect from my obligations and I've come to the realizations that I need to sit my ass down and just relax. It's not necessary to be always engaged in things that are \"productive.\" It's productive to let your mind engage in other things!\n\nAlex Sirac - Improving our relationship to news\n\nAlex has a written a great post on self-care by focusing on news consumption. Right away you wrote, \"Not only do I spend too much time on the Internet \u2013 I spend way too much time consuming content and news.\" You took the words right out of my mouth. News isn't limited to listening to reading it online, or watching it on the television (or historically radio). Now the news in the 21st comes in so many different mediums such as podcasts. I've seen an increase of this negative news. It discourages me to use any form of social media, even decentralized social media. I want to ignore but it seems hard not to even if you don't click links. \"Curating a me-friendly news experience\" by \"find[ing] the things that bring you joy and give your brain a break from the hate.\" It's important to step away from even if it's for a little while. We can't let it consume us to the core. It will make use dark and bitter. I catch myself becoming angry. You make a great point on finding the right sources and filtering things out by using an RSS reader. Even I as an avid New York Times and leftist news person, have to turn off my computer and throw my phone across the room to reattach myself to the world around me. It's got to the point where I have to go into my terminal and turn off the Docker container and turn of my RSS reader. There has to be a better way for everything. Support local journalism because we need to know what's happening in our hometowns and the places we live. We need to now what's happening in our communities to make a difference and become aware what's around us.\n\nJames G - Self Care\n\nJames wrote beautiful response regarding self-care. It is complicated! This has been something I've had to learn the hardway, \"I know, deep down, that feeling is unsustainable: one can't be creative every day.\" We want to create more every damn day. It's not always feasible. I agree with the following, \"I don't need to create new things all the time.\" The way I see it, is work on the things you are working on and give it your full attention in a reasonable manner. It's great to find comfort in things we are familiar with. It allows us to be vulnerable.\n\nLate or Missing Reponses\n\nIf you still would like to write a response for October, I'd be happy to recieve more. If you sent me a response and I missed it, please email me directly at pablo@lifeofpablo.com. I'll update this post.\n\nNovember IndieWeb Carnival\n\nNow, I will pass torche to Alex Sirac. Alex is writing on community and belonging for the month of November. C'est parti !\n\nInterested in participating and/or hosting an IndieWeb Carnival, please click here!

{"title": "Train Rides & Trader Joe's", "url": "https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/train-rides-and-trader-joes", "content": "Train Rides & Trader Joe's\n\nA view of the train from the inside\n\nThis post was written in English (en_US).\n\nEver since I was a kid I was always facinated with public transporation. I remember watching television and videos on the internet of people getting on public transportation. I always wondered why it isn't common to have it everywhere. I've lived in various parts around the world where it is simply normal to have various methods of public transportation. Having lived in Mexico for short periods of times, I did ride buses to get to the city because it was the most economical way. One slight issue living in the United States, I didn't grow up in an area where public transportion was none existent. I grew up in Nebraska. You needed a car to get around. It was also weird to be walking around. I found that idea to be weird.\n\nThe world has been surpassing the United States for decades. It's getting more obvious every day.\n\nSince I moved the California, I've taken the Amtrak Train thirty-five (35) times since 2021. It's an easy trip to do between Sacramento and San Francisco or even to other cities in California.\n\nTimes I've Taken the Train Year Progress 2021 - 7 Times 2022 - 9 Times 2023 - 17 Times\n\nThe last time I did even remotely close to this was when I was living in France. I still have all the tickets to show.\n\nReasons I Take The Train:\n\nEnvironment - A lot more people can move around all at one time and it elimates so many cars off the roads. It helps reduce emissions.\n\nConvenience - There is enough trains throught out the day, that you can just book your ticket minutes before it heads out.\n\nAvoiding traffic - Driving isn't fun when you're surrounded by cars waiting for the line to move. It's nice not having to wait around in traffic when the train is simply going on its way on the the tracks.\n\nNot paying for parking - Parking in cities such as San Francisco is so expensive or you have to move your car for city services. It seems so much of a hastle to be worrying about your car in a place where you can walk.\n\nNot worrying about my car in a big city. - With so many car break-ins happening throughout cities in the United States, I can breath a sigh of relief knowing I don't have to worry about my car left alone or pondering if I did my best to get everything out of sight.\n\nI can get work done on the train. - I'm always working on my computer and I can get so much done weather it's for work or for personal endeavors.\n\nI also enjoy getting groceries at Trader Joe's before I get on the train especially if I'm going to get back to Sacramento late. It's nice to be able to get groceries for the week and take them with me on the train. It's a small little habit or tradition. I also save money by buying snacks ahead of time and not having to spend extra on snacks on the train.\n\nI hope my friend Sammy can come out to California for a fun train ride from Sacramento to San Francisco. I know he'd love it. Heck even one of these days, I'd love to catch the train that runs (Amtrak California Zephyr) through our hometowns in Nebraska and ride up to Sacramento. Hopefully soon!", "label": "personal"}

Merci Alex pour ta pr\u00e9sentation sur la sujet de communaut\u00e9.\n\nCommunity and belonging for me means, a place I feel that I belong and a place where I can be accepted for who I am. It's been hard to integrate into some communities. Often, being the only person color in a community has been difficult at times.We enter and leave communities as we older. Some communities change for the greater good and others change not for the greater good. I belong to different communities. My background and life experiences have influenced who I've become and the things I've been interested in. I've entered new ones while I've left others. Some communities I can come back and be able to jump right in right where I left off. There are communities where it was only during a certain period of my life and might be harder to be in now. There are communities where I've had to leave because it no longer followed who I was as a person or it wasn't good for me. Some became dangerous in their vission\n\nI'd like to talk about community and belonging in these three (3) situations or places.\n\nBeing a Multilingual\n\nBeing a Student in France\n\nIndieWeb\n\nI'd like to write about these topics in this carnival but I'd like to take make a dedicated post with a slightly different approach.\n\nBeing Mexican and American\n\nGrowing up in Nebraska\n\nBeing Multilingual\n\nHere in the United States, it's not common for people to speak another language. Which is a shame. Growing up in a small town in Nebraska, it often seemed that it was few of us who would consistently speak another language. Even at a young age, I felt we had a small unintentional community. I was very fortunate to grow up bilingual - Spanish & English (in this order). Then I learned French in my teens.\n\nBeing a multilingual here in the United States has allowed me to be join new communities. With the amount of people who don't speak at least a second language on a constant basis, it almost feels exclusive to be multilingual. It allows me to have deeper connections with others. It allows me to belong in various communities. When I was living in Omaha, One example is attending French speaking events at Alliance Fran\u00e7aise and on Meet-Up. It was so amazing that I could find so many individuals who I can speak French with and share many of the world views. It was nice to meet so many francophiles and francophones who enjoyed sharing culture, language, cuisine, wine and so much more. I would become great friends with these individuals. Now that I live far away, I know if I were to visit or move back, I could rejoin this community. Going back to a place where I'm a visitor and one I am familiar with, I know I can find a place of belonging again.\n\nGrowing up in a place that lacked lingual diversity, or to simply put it - growing up in a very vanilla place, it also seemed that there was a community that didn't seem to like people speaking different languages. It seemed to alienate them. There seemed to be pressure to join the community where one needed to behave and present themselves with the majority. I know people who had my cultural background give into that community and not speak their language spoken at home. Parents gave in the idea that there kids will be more valuable in society if they don't speak another language. I felt supported and limited by these co-existing communities. I'd be lying if at one point I didn't fall in this negative community. I felt at times I needed this negative community to to belong. Learning to belong to something that conflict with my values felt like being pulled in both directions.\n\nBeing a Student in France\n\nI have very fond memories of being an exchange student in France. I studied at the Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg at the age 22. Being a student in France was different compared the attending university in the United States. Being in University you build Not only was I apart of the exchange student community but I was also a student trying to improve my French abilities. I was the only student from the university back home who attended a program in France. I isolated myself the Americans. In a way I left the \"American\" community for many months. I saw this as a blessing to form new habits and quickly find a new community or communities. We were here to learn the French language. We all were from various parts of the world. I was hanging out with all the people and students from France, the rest of the European Union, South America, and basically anyone from around the world. Just not the Americans\n\nWe were homesick. We bonded with food. We made meals from our respective cultures. We would learn about their upbringing and how they got to France. We all bonded together because many of us had experiences with immigrant culture. Many of these students were also immigrants to France or have been in the European Union already. They were trying establish themselves and incorporate themselves in the society. Seeing them everyday reminded me of my parents telling me stories of them trying to make their way in the United States. I understand being in a new place and trying to find a sense of belonging can be daunting.\n\nYes, I could do many of these things back at my home university. There was such a deeper connection with these international students. We were living and studying in a place where being a student meant so much more. I felt I could have genuine conversations with people. I really felt like I belonged here and understand what it's like to be student outside the United States. Student community here is nothing like in the United States.\n\nIndieWeb\n\nOh the IndieWeb! I joined back in March 2023. I heard of the IndieWeb throughout the years but didn't think much of it. I'm happy that I got the interest and courage to join. This is a community that I am truly happy to have found. It has become a community I truly feel that I am apart of. The best part of it is getting to meet so many great people and interacting with them on a weekly basis. People are so willing to help each other out. I've had people reach out if there is something wrong with my website or microformats are not placed correctly. It's been pretty rad attending Homebrew Website Club. Every single one of them has been pretty amazing. I really enjoy the encouragement of taking initiative to as planning events, starting writing carnivals, etc. It's a pretty open group.\n\nThe IndieWeb has helped me grow as an individual. It has also rekindled the fire in things I didn't think I would find interest again. One example of that is blogging. It This community has helped me find a new place of belonging.\n\nI will admit since I'm still relatively new to the community, I'm still a little shy and still learning the ropes. I know that this is part of the journey.\n\nConclusion\n\nI'm happy with all these experiences.", "label": "personal"}

I'm that person who doesn't use Spotify. I left Spotify a while ago. I instead use Apple Music does something similar to Spotify Wrapped. I honestly didn't know that Apple Music had a feature to share. Now it's time for the results my Apple Music Replay'23 (the Apple equivalent to Spotify Wrappted) to shine. It was interesting because I had to launch my browser to get the Replay'23 instead of it being in app. It was easy to share on social media as images. My listens ranged from mid/late 2000s to more recent. I really liked listening to The Submarines. I'm a sucker for the song Brightest Hour.\n\nThis coming I would like to discover smaller indie bands and attend more concerts to get out of my cycle of repeating and getting too comfortable with the things I listen often.\n\nI really like Jo's Post on what she listened to on Spotify. I love what you listened to this year and how you organized your post!\n\nI read Henrique's Post on what he listened to on Spotify. He made me remember that I need to give my vinyls a little more love (or a spin) and decrease my listening minutes on my phone.\n\nI know I have an interesting taste in Music but I like listening to alternative.\n\nWell here you go!

He also asks his readers to answer the question\n\nWhere do you call home? And why? I\u2019ve been struggling with the concept of home for the past several years.\n\nOn the surface, this seems like a very simple question to answer but the answer can be be complex. For me, I take the complex route. I too have been struggling with this question. Home is where major moments have occured in my life.\n\nI grew up in Nebraska which was home for 25+ years. I say this is one place I call home is due to the fact this is where I grew up. It's where I learned the norms of the Midwest and how it influenced my persona. Nebraska is home because this is where many of my friends I made in university still reside. I have many deep connections with others. I somehow always end up here such as the holidays and other important events. It's a very special place to me but it is not the place I cull my current home.\n\nMexico is also my home for the fact I've lived there on an off though out the years. I learned what is was like to be around non-Americans. Living in Mexico, I got meet so many family members. I learned more of the traditions of my people and how live in a community. I learned that this was a place of rich culture and rich gastronomy. I learned to not take things for granted. It's a place I call home because it allows me to be different person compared to my American self. For the record, I don't go to resorts, I stay in rural Mexico. This is a home I return to often. This home is important to my identity.\n\nThe home I consider currently now is in California. This is the first place I moved away to where I didn't go back to my parents' home after an extended leave such as a trip or going to university. I work here now and I have built out new relationships. I'm still pretty new here. Living in California has allowed me to be more of myself and allow me to express myself. This is home because I get to work on myself as well. When people ask me where am I based out of or where is my home is, I always say California.\n\nI also ask the same question, \"Where do you call home? And why?\"", "label": "personal"}

I'm excited to see my friends and most importantly, my family.\n\nMy hometown is quiet. There's enough to do. There are stores, parks, movie theaters. Just enough. There are subtle things I do miss about my hometown. It's the place that saw me grow up. A place where I am familiar with.\n\nSomething happens as I enter my childhood home. I spent most of my childhood in this house. When I step into the home, so many many memories flood my mind. It's like I unzipped a .zip file and the entire folder just spills. Every step I take and every time I turn my head, flashbacks come to me as well.\n\nThere are so many moments that make me feel happy. I remember it was here I got my first computer. It's where I learned to ride a bike. I remember helping my mom study for the U.S Citizenship Test everyday afterschool. I remember numerous times packing and unpacking for/from Mexico. I remember the moment I learned I was accepted into university.\n\nMy bedroom was a place of safety. A place where I could be myself. The place where I learned. I took apart my first computer. A place I recorded my first audio note. A place to allow my emotions to run free.\n\nWe didn't live in the best house but it was our house. We had a roof over our heads.\n\nI reflect back on all this and it brings a smile of joy. So much has happened. So many things happening in the background I didn't know were happening.\n\nI'm here now rearranging my room. I feel happy that I can still make it my own and still have a place of safety.", "label": "personal"}
{"title": "The Friend I Made on the Bus", "url": "https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/friend-on-bus", "content": "I was browsing the web and I happened to stumble upon this Instagram post. It was a screenshot of a tweet OP posted about two girls on a cruise who became best friends for the day. One of the girls was looking for her best friend that day.\n\nHere is what the post said, if you don't want to open an Instagram link. The post also has the picture of two girls on the cruise sitting next to each other.\n\nin Hawaii in 2006. We were basically best friends for that night so I need y'all to help me find my bestfriend because I miss her and I need to see how she's doing now. Please retweet this so we can be reunited.\n\nThis helped me unlock a memory of an experience I had as a young kid. I remember my family and I took the Greyhound bus back from Mexico all the way to Nebraska. This was in the early 2000s. Let me tell you. When you're six or seven on a bus from Southern Mexico to Nebraska, you feel like dying, died, and forgot you died on a 48+ hour (or however long) ride. Maybe I'm being dramatic. It wasn't a pleasant ride, at least most of it.\n\nI remember when the bus made a stop somewhere in Texas possibly in Austin or Dallas. I remember I was already having a bad time since I've been on a bus for an extended amount of time. Then some kid around my age got on the bus with his family. I gave him the nod to acknowledge him. He happened to sit near us. An hour or so had passed and I was curious and was desperate to talk to someone who wasn't in my family. So I said hello to the kid. I don't regret doing so.\n\nWhen I said hello, right off the bat we hit it off. We were talking about a bunch of nerd stuff that kids our age were interested in.. I remember bringing up our computers and we lost our minds. I was telling him about the iMac G3s I would use at school or how my friend built a small website on his computer. He would tell me about things he'd create on Kid Pix. We also talked about our favorite TV shows, our hobbies, and upbringings. We shared stories. This kid was super cool! I hope he thought I was cool too. We had a grand old time.\n\nAt some point, he and his family had to get off to their transfer point or it was their final destination. We said our goodbyes. Then I waved at him, he waved back when he was on the ground. It was a very warm and sad moment to say goodbye to my best friend of that day.\n\nI unfortunately don't remember his name and I doubt he remembers mine. At that time, it wasn't common for young kids to have a cell phone. We didn't exchange numbers or email. I think about this often. I wish I could find out where he is and if he is doing well. Who knows what paths we've taken? Have we crossed paths and not known it? I hope we get to meet someday and this post comes across him and we could reconnect.\n\nIf you're out there man, say hello!\n\nDo you have a story similar to this? I'd love to hear from you.", "label": "personal"}

When the holidays approach, I get excited to see snow on the ground. There are so many celebrations and traditions that exist. For myself, I celebrate Mexican traditions and American celebrations. I live between the two cultures and grew up in the United States and have lived in Mexico. At my parents home, we celebrate as if we were in Mexico.\n\nEvery year is different. Sometimes I'm in Oaxaca during the month of December and sometimes I'm in the United States. We celebrate Mexican traditions there but more precisely, the Oaxacan traditions. I like to go see the dances and the parades. May I say it's heavenly go to the food markets and try all the delicious meals.\n\nMexican Traditions:\n\nMy family really likes cooking at home. We make many traditional dishes. We make tamales of various flavors, Mexican punch, mole, cakes, shrimp cocktails, and so much more. There's no limit. In this month, we don't normally eat out. Homemade food tastes so much better!\n\nIn the evenings, we relax and watch some holiday movies. We like to watch movies in Spanish, especially any of the classics. Every year we see Home Alone in Spanish because it's very funny. It hits differently in Spanish. Just being together is important. We can laugh as a family.\n\nWe do decorate our Christmas tree. We open the presents on the night of December 24. It's a traditon. It's always been like that.\n\nUnited States Traditions:\n\nI always make sure to meet up with my friends when I return to Nebraska. Now that we don't live near each other anymore, it's very important to be together when we are back in our hometowns. We check in with each other and see how our year went and what our goals are for the upcoming year. We build ginger houses and we have a party. What could go wrong? Depending on how the weather is, we're riding our longboards or we're going to skate park.\n\nIm always excited for a night of programming fun. We just see where the night will take us. We make it our goal to stay up until dawn. It's a very nice thing to schedule something together. I think we're going to make a video game this year. Let's see what happens...\n\nThis is my response to IndieWeb Carnival December 2023 \u2014 Holiday and December traditions Thank you for hosting Jo!

{"title": "Using JSON on My Site", "url": "https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/using-json-on-my-site", "content": "Using JSON on My Site\n\nThis post was written in English (en_US).\n\nThis past week, I've been learning to use JSON on my website. As I am learning to implement a Micropub Server on my site, I feel that I should learn how JSON works. In a way JSON has been used on my site before by using microformats in the rendered HTML code and being read by other sites and services. I've been wanting to explore ways to update content on my site in a more effective manner instead of having to manually update html code for each entry of a list. An example of this would be a list of movies I watched. This is still a a learning process. I have so much to learn. I want to expand Datenstrom Yellow, the flat-file c I am using, to still be simple but be powerful at the same time.\n\nAn issue I have to work out for longevity and simplicity is by creating an extension for the different lists. Right now I have to create a layout for a particular list such as movies , create a new markdown page in my content folder, and finally set the desired layout (template). An example of this would be Layout: movies . This isn't ideal when I write a blog post. If I changed the layout of a blog post, it wouldn't be recognized as a blog post in the main blog feed. That's where an extension would come in place and place it in the markdown file of the blog post or any other page I'd like to create on my website. This wouldn't require to change the layout. In the markdown file, I could simply place, [list 1] or even simply, [movies] to show the list. Coming Soon!\n\nExample Code:\n\nHere's the layout for movies.html . I use PHP to create the reoccuring HTML elements automatically when I modify the movie JSON file. It will update the list accordingly.\n\n$this ->yellow->layout( \"header\" ) < div class = \"content\" > < div class = \"main h-entry\" role = \"main\" > < h1 > echo $this ->yellow->page->getHtml( \"titleContent\" ) </ h1 > < div class = \"entry-content e-content\" > echo $this ->yellow->page->getContentHtml() </ div > < div class = \"mw6 center\" > $catalog_json = file_get_contents( 'media/downloads/movies.json' ); $decoded_json = json_decode($catalog_json, true ); $items = $decoded_json[ 'movies' ]; foreach ($items as $item) { $id = $item[ 'id' ]; $name = $item[ 'title' ]; $cover = $item[ 'cover' ]; $info_url = $item[ 'info_url' ]; echo '<article class=\"h-item\">' ; echo '<a class=\"link dt w-100 bb b--black-10 pb2 mt2 dim blue u-url\" href=\"' .$info_url. '\">' ; echo '<div class=\"dtc w4\">' ; echo '<img src=\" ' .$cover. '\" class=\"db w-100 u-photo\" alt=\"movie poster of ' .$name. '\"/>' ; echo '</div>' ; echo '<div class=\"dtc v-top pl2\">' ; echo '<h1 class=\"f6 f5-ns fw6 lh-title black mv0 p-name\">' .$name. '</h1>' ; echo '<dl class=\"mt2 f6\">' ; echo '<dt class=\"clip\">ID</dt>' ; echo '<dd class=\"ml0\">ID: ' .$id. '</dd>' ; echo '</dl>' ; echo '</div>' ; echo '</a>' ; echo '</article>' ; } </ div > < div class = \"permalink\" > Permalink: < a class = \"u-url\" href = \"https://lifeofpablo.com<?php echo $this->yellow->page->getLocation($absoluteLocation = false) ?>\" > https://lifeofpablo.com echo $this ->yellow->page->getLocation($absoluteLocation = false ) </ a > </ div > </ div > </ div > $this ->yellow->layout( \"footer\" )\n\nJSON\n\nThis is the example movie JSON (movies.json) code for the movies I watched in 2023.

I started to consume matcha two years ago. Ever since, I've been hooked on it. I love getting matcha from different places from coffee shops or restaurants because when mixed in for a drink, each place makes it different. Most of the time, I consume matcha as a tea or as a latte. There is something so special about getting in a different city. When I was visiting New York City, I lived on matcha lattes and matcha teas to keep me going on the miles and miles of walking that I'm not used to doing. Being a city like New York, it is exhausting mentally and physically due to the stimuli and increased physical activity from the sedentary lifestyle.\n\nMatcha has caffeine in it but it doesn't affect me the same as coffee. Coffee and espresso keeps me jittery and has be bouncing off the walls. Not a good feeling overall. I'm not opposed to having coffee or espresso but not my preferred choice. Matcha doesn't keep me up at night. I don't see it as coffee but an item that has caffeine.\n\nWhen I went back to Nebraska, I was happy that some of the non-Starbucks coffee shops had matcha. I guess matcha is more common than ever.\n\nAm I crazy about matcha? Probably? Who am I kidding?! YES! I don't drink it often but when I do, I'm as happy as can be (at the moment.) It's the little things in life. I probably should make my own at home because it adds up going out to get it. That's a decision for another day.\n\nJust realized this could be a love letter to matcha.

The certificate had five courses ranging from basic networking to IT Security. I would say this was a well rounded course. It really put in perspective various aspects of an IT Support Professional. It was also a wake-up call! I have so much to learn still!!!\n\nBeing in this role, you could be a generalist or a specialist. This depends on the role one gets. In my role and working with a small team of IT professionals, I find myself being a generalist but also specialized in specific things.\n\nI find it important is to keep learning in my career. I plan on taking more courses to get more certificates to gain more skills. I started a Google Cyber Security Course and a mathematics course. I'm going to try to balance three to five courses. I want to get in the routine of going back to school. I find this funny because I work at a school. By having this routine, I would like to start my Master's program this year.\n\nI'm really excited for what's to come this year!

I noticed prices over the last year have been going up everywhere and Trader Joe's is no exception. I've been working on only buying the things I only need or things to supplement the items I have at home. For example, I bought spinach dip to help me finish the chips I have at home and I bought baby carrots (Cut & Peeled Carrots) to help finish the spinach dip. Inflation is coming on all of us hard. I almost gasped out loud in the store when I saw the price of a litter bottle of the Extra Virgin Olive Oil. I remember it being $8.99 now it's $10.99. It's just the little things that add up. I have to be extra mindful of the inventory of my kitchen and buy only the things I need and think of items that be versatile in use.\n\nOne of my goals this year is to simply not be as wasteful.

In the past I would blog sporadically. I've always loved blogging as it allows me to express myself and allow my thoughts to flow (when they feel like it). It's allowed me to become more expressive and to reconnect with myself. I would say I feel more satisfied in becoming more expressive and to reconnect myself. It's a piece of a puzzle.\n\nDeciding What to Share\n\nYou know how there are things about yourself for the longest time, you didn't know whether or not to share publicly? There are things I'm not willing to share. At some point you are ready to share certain things. Then, you come to the realization of \"How am I going to put this in words?\" That's the part that's tricky. That's me at this very moment in time. I'm ready to share. I'll do my best.\n\nThe Journey\n\nPart of this journey has been working on myself and learning to accept who I am as a person. For the longest time I wasn't living my true self. I lived in two worlds, the American lifestyle outside of home and the Latino culture at home. I felt like two walls parallel to each other trying to keep me aligned. I never felt enough for the Americans and never felt enough for the Mexicans. Me being the only boy in my immediate family, I had to set an example, I had to think about carrying the family last name, and etc. As an American who is Mexican, I always felt like I was more scrutinized under a microscope than my non-latino counterparts. I had to find ways to circumvent this to allow myself to slightly express myself even in the slightest. I worried so much people would think of me and I felt judged. I let that dictate so much of my life. I was so sad and miserable and asked myself, \"How much more of this can I take?\" All this put me in a negative headspace that hurt me and directly or indirectly hurt others I loved. I still cry thinking about this. I'm still learning how to undo this damage I've caused. It will take time but will it ever go away completely? I'm not sure. Going to therapy has aided in defragmenting so many pieces of my life. And made me realize that, I have to start living my own life and care for my own happiness. Healing has to be a priority.\n\nLurking\n\nIf you've been wondering this whole time what this post is about, yes, this is my coming out post. I've been for years waiting to share this moment in some format. I've thought about sharing on Instagram or Facebook but I decided against this. I'd rather do it on my personal website and any of the decentralized platforms I use. I've watched so many coming out videos, and social media posts of people I know or strangers on the internet. That has been inspiring. I've been lurking the idea of this for so long. I finally brought myself to do this. Once I publish this, there is no going back. Once something is on the internet, it's there forever. I would be lying if I said I wasn't nervous or having second thoughts. I also think about how we live in a time where LGBT rights are under attack. I simply have to do this for myself and face the outcome of this. Positive or negative. So here it is...\n\nMy Sexuality\n\n\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 I'm sharing that I'm a bisexual person. \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08\n\nBisexuality is variously defined as romantic or sexual attraction to both males and females, to more than one gender, or attraction to both people of the same gender and different genders.\n\nI am attracted to both men and women. It's a spectrum and there is no 50%-50% split. I feel at this time more attractive to people who identify as male than I am to someone who identifies as female. That varies by day as well. Some of my greatest loves have been women. I'm also open to the attraction towards more gender identities.\n\nHow Long ?\n\nI knew since I was five or six that I felt different about myself. Then the questions of, \"when are you having a girlfriend?\" or \"I bet you have insert number here of girls chasing you!?\" I did want that to happen at many points. Also, I had big crushes on other dudes.\n\nWho have you told?\n\nI've told friends and family who I am as an individual. Every single one of them I've told, each interaction with them was different. Some interactions were very heavy with emotion, some were very easy, and some I felt I was going to die inside because I was afraid of the reaction. Some took time to come around. Everything came alright in the end. I've felt supported. Even if the interaction didn't go as well, I felt the anxiety leave my body and be at a new level of peace with myself. I still tear up thinking about how strong and vulnerable I was in every single interaction. I'm very lucky to have friends and family who are supported. Some mentioned, \"We knew, Pablo. We were waiting for you to share.\" *Queue laughing after ugly crying *. Every moment was beautiful. My relationships have become stronger. I no longer have to hide, in plain sight to my loved ones. They no longer have to see me suffer inside. My family bond has also become stronger. I don't have to hide by putting a wall around me. I can actually be open with them and tell them what I'm feeling.\n\nWhat's to come?\n\nWell, I've been going on dates and meeting lots of people in the community. I have a supported community living in California that makes it a bit easier. I have so much more to learn about myself and make my way. I want to explore my sexuality more and take it to the next level. I don't see my sexuality to be the forefront of my persona. It's a piece of the puzzle that helps form me to be simply, me! I've added this piece to the puzzle. There are other pieces that I have to find their place.\n\nI'm happier with myself now. I can smile an actual smile now. My face isn't hiding behind a mask. I'm starting to live my more authentic self. I'm still going to be me at the end of the day. My sexuality is only one piece of the puzzle of who I am as a person.", "label": "personal"}

I voted in the California Primary for the first time since moving here. I guess I do officially live here. I love how easy it is to vote in person here in Sacramento. The original plan was to submit my mail-in-ballot but I accidentally got my primary ballot soaked when I was carrying my water bottle. Of course, I forgot to request a new one and days went on without thinking about it. Then it dawned on me that today was voting day. I had in my navigation to a specific voting location and on the way there, I saw another polling location. I canceled the navigation and pulled into the polling places I had just driven by. I was so excited because, why go out of my way when I can do it right then and there!\n\nChecking in was easy. I gave my basic information for them to print off the ballot. There was an option to do it electronically but I chose paper instead. I was briefed on where the ballot drop-box was located to place the ballot after I have completed filling it out. My ballot was placed in a secrecy vanilla folder to provide discretion in carrying it between the voting official station and the voting cubicle. After receiving the ballot, I went to a voting station cubicle and filled in my ballot. I voted for those I felt would do good in their current or future positions. I had done some research on the candidates. If you don't, you really should see what each candidate stands for and look at the finer details. Then, once I was satisfied with myself filling in all the ovals, I placed the ballot in the secrecy vanilla folder to prepare to turn it in. I walked across the room to place the ballot in the ballot drop-box.\n\nFinally, I got a sticker to show off that I voted. This time I chose a sticker that says, \"Yo Vot\u00e9\" which is Spanish for, \"I Voted\".\n\nIt was that easy! It seemed very seamless. This really motivates me to pay attention in local elections that help shape the future of the city I am living in. Voting is important and a fundamental right which I am happy to exercise. I'm happy I participated in doing my civic duty to vote. We all have a voice. We are the voice for those who can't.", "label": "personal"}

It's taught me things, I wouldn't learn staying in one place. Learning about yourself is key for growth. Often, while learning we also learn from people. These people you learn from are strangers. I remember hanging out with strangers in Rome for an entire day. I've roamed around the city of Seoul, Korea with people I met on the bus. You get the idea. Meeting strangers is fun.\n\nI've learned so much from the people I've interacted on my travels. They've shown me their perspective on various topics and provided some life advice as well. All of these people have been strangers. I made a connection with them even if was sitting with them, eating lunch or spending the day with them.

I want to also have degrees beyond a bachelor's degree. My goal in the near but possibly distance future is to get a doctorate degree. Even with a master's degree, it's been a dream to teach a course or two at the university level.

Woo hoo! I've lived on this earth for 29 years. Time flies and I honestly didn't think I would have made it this far but here I am! That being said, I have officially entered my last year of my 20s. It\u2019s a tad bitter sweet. but the positive overtakes the negative by a long shot. I reflect the growth I\u2019ve had when I entered my 20s.\n\n28 was a fun year of adventures and of learning. It was very fulfilling. I'm smiling as I think of the things I did this year. I would say 28 was a level up in all aspects. I felt more accomplished and I had an increased sense of self-direction.\n\nTraveled with friends\n\nTook myself on Artist Dates\n\nHelped develop a game with Friends\n\nGetting Google Certified in a few areas\n\nVoted in my first California Primary\n\nSang in a few choir concerts\n\n29 will be a great transition year into the next decade of my life. I\u2019m still discovering who I am as an individual. I now know more about myself than ever. I feel a bit wiser. This has been a year of a lot of reflection.\n\nThere is so much to learn about this world and where I stand in it. I continue to learn from people around me and the things unknown to me. What does it mean to be a Mexican-American at 29 years of age?\n\nA lot will happen this year. Many events this year will have an effect on me directly and indirectly. I am excited and terrified for what's to come. I will keep my head up and fight for the greater good. I've learned not to be anxious of things I can't control yet because they haven't happened yet. Being more in the present is key to the well being of myself.\n\nI've made many mistakes in years past. that I don't want to replicate. There are things I am not proud of but I've come to terms of not living in the past. I don't allow myself to beat myself up as hard as I used to. There's no need spend energy on things that don't matter anymore.\n\nJust learning to love myself this past year and I am continuing to work on myself. I'm in a better place now than when I had just turned 28. My mental health, my physical health, and emotional wellness are more in tune. Now that I've set the path, it's only up for these. I'm more balanced now.\n\nOn a positive note, I'm really excited to start school again. I really value learning and I have a desire to have a master's degree. Later this summer I'm also getting a promotion at work.\n\nSome items I wish to accomplish (no particular order) at 29\n\nLearn Chinese\n\nI WILL join cross fit or attend exercise classes.\n\nI would like to learn to dance.\n\nGet the startup I'm working on off the ground.\n\nWork on personal and work projects that have been on the back burner. I hope to reach these goals.\n\nJoin a LGBT sports league.\n\nGet my financials in order. I should set up a will.\n\nGo on a solo adventure far away from home.\n\nGo on more hikes!\n\nLooking Forward\n\nThere are so many positive things happening in my life. It's only up from here!

What better way than to expose yourself to other individual's tastes in music? I would hang out with Abraham and Luke. I'd say, they influenced who I am as a person and the direction of my musical tastes.\n\nAbraham grew up in Colombia and moved out to my hometown in Nebraska. Luke grew up in Hawaii and had moved to Nebraska a year before. Both Luke and Abraham played the guitar.

My friends at the time still took me in and accepted me into the group. It was super duper to watch live shows in my friend's basement. They used to play covers of Subline, Linkin Park, and Bullet for My Valentine.\n\nAt that time frame, I was very interested in photography and videography. I always carried my Sony Cyber-Shot with me because you never know when you would need to get that cool shot. You're probably thinking, \"That's some lame point in shoot!\" When your parents buy you a camera, you have to work with what you got! A camera is a camera!\n\nQuestion time!\n\nCan you guess which role did I play in my friend group? If you guessed the camera guy, you win a cookie! Do you like internet cookies?

It was a pretty cool experience getting blasted with hardcore metal while figuring out the best way of recording! I learned important fundamentals of video recording. I focused on stabilizing the camera, considering lighting, and audio clipping (which I had no control over). Not only was I enjoying myself but also I learned a lot.\n\nOne of my favorite memories when we weren't in Luke's basement was walking to get pizza. Living in a small town, things are relatively within walking distance.\n\nAs time went on friends came and went. We all went our different paths even though we lived in the same hometown for years.

I don't mind it for many reasons. Especially after the pandemic, the methods I use to interact with people have drastically changed.\n\nAttending online meetings is fun for me especially if I enjoy attending meetings on topics I enjoy! Attending anything IndieWeb-related via Homebrew Website Club. Topics discussed are the IndieWeb technologies, technical solutions, receiving advice on building something, and more. Of course, the meetings are not always technical. One of my favorite things we do in Homebrew Website Club is showing off the changes we've done on our personal websites! I love it when someone shares that new feature on their site or that blog post that someone finally finished! It makes me happy that people are proud of their work!\n\nWe also share those articles we like or share that cool website with that cool font or the picture someone took today. The meetings are for everyone to share a topic that is interesting to them. The conversation possibilities are endless. I've received great advice from fellow IndieWeb members on how to do XYZ. I also love picking the brains of others on XYZ especially when it comes to my personal website. I am very grateful for this. Some days I don't participate as often but I'm always attentive to what I can learn from others.\n\nI always look forward to events beyond Homebrew Website Club meetings! These are something to look forward to! These events usually have a specific goal or topic in mind. For example, I love attending writing meet-ups for dedicated writing time. It helps provide a dedicated time to write a blog post that's been marinating in my drafts for a while. Maybe you get the inspiration to write something completely new. I also enjoy the Build a Website in an Hour event to create a new page on your personal website or launch a completely new website. The event ideas are infinite! It'd be nice to see more variations on events. My goal is to host an event soon! Stay tuned!\n\nEveryone and anyone is welcome to attend these online events. You don't need to be part of the IndieWeb. If you're curious about joining one of the events, just come hang out with us! You don't have to have a personal website or be tech-savy. We'd be happy to answer your questions! Attending these meetings is a great way to connect with people located on the other side of the world.

I don't mind it for many reasons. Especially after the pandemic, the methods I use to interact with people have drastically changed.\n\nAttending online meetings is fun for me especially if I enjoy attending meetings on topics I enjoy! Attending anything IndieWeb-related via Homebrew Website Club. Topics discussed are the IndieWeb technologies, technical solutions, receiving advice on building something, and more. Of course, the meetings are not always technical. One of my favorite things we do in Homebrew Website Club is showing off the changes we've done on our personal websites! I love it when someone shares that new feature on their site or that blog post that someone finally finished! It makes me happy that people are proud of their work!\n\nWe also share those articles we like or share that cool website with that cool font or the picture someone took today. The meetings are for everyone to share a topic that is interesting to them. The conversation possibilities are endless. I've received great advice from fellow IndieWeb members on how to do XYZ. I also love picking the brains of others on XYZ especially when it comes to my personal website. I am very grateful for this. Some days I don't participate as often but I'm always attentive to what I can learn from others.\n\nI always look forward to events beyond Homebrew Website Club meetings! These are something to look forward to! These events usually have a specific goal or topic in mind. For example, I love attending writing meet-ups for dedicated writing time. It helps provide a dedicated time to write a blog post that's been marinating in my drafts for a while. Maybe you get the inspiration to write something completely new. I also enjoy the Build a Website in an Hour event to create a new page on your personal website or launch a completely new website. The event ideas are infinite! It'd be nice to see more variations on events. My goal is to host an event soon! Stay tuned!\n\nEveryone and anyone is welcome to attend these online events. You don't need to be part of the IndieWeb. If you're curious about joining one of the events, just come hang out with us! You don't have to have a personal website or be tech-savy. We'd be happy to answer your questions! Attending these meetings is a great way to connect with people located on the other side of the world. Maybe you'll meet someone who lives in the same city as you?\n\nThis blog post has been posted on IndieNews", "label": "personal"}

This is especially true when I return to Nebraska. When I land, I'll go with the person who picked me up at the diner after midnight. Going to the diner is a fun adventure when it's snowing, raining, sunny, hot, chilly, or raining cats and dogs!\n\nDiners are also places to meet people who have only met through a virtual medium such as video calls and online groups. Rarely do you meet people in real life (IRL) you get to converse weekly online.\n\nA few weeks ago in July, I met with James G. We both actively participate in the IndieWeb. (You should check it out!) James is a coffee lover and also enjoys writing. He was telling me about a coffee mojito.\n\nJames mentioned a while ago that he was visiting San Francisco for work during Homebrew Website Club. I was very excited to get a coffee and walk around the city. San Francisco is one of my favorite cities\n\nYou're wondering, \"So you two are getting coffee and talking? What 'bout the diner?\" Originally, getting coffee and chatting was the original plan. Then, I remembered that James loves diners and this got my brain juices flowing! WE SHOULD GO TO THE DINER! This is not a drill! I love a good side trip to spice up the adventure. Food and coffee unite people.\n\nI love food and getting caffeinated\n\nDiners are lovely! James loves diners. I've never heard of someone loving diners as much as he does! It makes me very happy!\n\nWe decided to eat at a fine establishment called the Pinecrest Diner. This place is an institution in San Francisco! Imagine a traditional diner restaurant with yummy breakfast food but in SF! The food is so heavenly people wait in line. This place truly hits the spot. They make the food in front of you due to the openness of the space.\n\nWhile eating, we caught up and we discussed various topics of interest. We discussed our visions for our respective personal websites, our current projects, Mozilla, and things to do in San Francisco such as checking out Noisebridge. I also recommended The Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment in Oakland. I enjoyed the discussions and ideas bounced off each other.\n\nThank you James for hanging out! I had a blast!\n\nI hope to see James when I'm on his side of the water. Should I see you at IndieWebCamp San Francisco?", "label": "personal"}

I\u2019ve been starting to get things organized but it almost seems there is no end. I enjoy taking breaks and leaving the apartment. Going on walks around the neighborhood is fun but I always go on an adventure. I\u2019m getting my steps on and I have fun! I also get a snack or coffee while on an adventure. The sidewalk and my legs are possibly the limit.\n\nEventually, I found myself near Powell Station to take a break. As I was leaning against a wall, I asked myself, \u201cWhat should I do to feel that I live here?\u201d and \u201cWhat is cheap but fulfilling?\u201d\n\nHmm\u2026.\n\nQueue the Jeopardy think music.\n\nYour browser does not support the audio element.\n\nIt came to me! I yelled out loud \u201cI know! I\u2019ll get a library card today!\u201d Mind you, I\u2019m at a busy location in the city. I think I started a bit of people waiting for the street car. There could be worse things to be yelling for in a city. Wouldn\u2019t you get excited if you wanted to get a library card? Going to the library is exciting! I\u2019m excited to go visit one of the oldest public institutions offered to the public! If I know anything about libraries in big cities, their main branch must be beautiful. Onward to the San Francisco Public Library!\n\nMan! When I walked into the SF Library, it was pretty cool! It\u2019s pretty modern! There is lots of elbow room to roam around!\n\nAs I\u2019m walking towards the library, I fill out the online application to start the process and get the confirmation number that I was provided.\n\nThen when I got to the desk, I was asked for this confirmation number, identification, and some proof of where I lived such as a utility bill or lease agreement. The process was super easy. The people working at the library were very friendly.\n\nHere is the library card design that I chose. It was either between the SF Giants or the drawing a second grader. Obviously, I went with the drawing because I don\u2019t care about baseball. The drawing is pretty cool! Better than I could ever do.\n\nAfter getting my library card, I explored the various floors throughout the library. This place is massive! Various items caught my eye. They let you borrow vinyls! Who does that!? I\u2019m over the moon!\n\nI didn\u2019t know that the San Francisco Public Library is a Government Information Center (GIC). It\u2019s very accessible to get documents from various levels of government.\n\nThe Government Information Center (GIC) provides free access to United States, California, San Francisco, and Bay Area regional agency government documents, and to materials on public policy, political science, public administration, and the law.\n\nI\u2019ll have to spend more time exploring the library system and its website to see how I can maximize the resources available to me. I want to support the library more. This is a lesson to utilize public libraries and other public resources available to constituents.\n\nGetting my library card was an easy experience. Everyone should be able to use the library. I'm excited to be spending a lot of time here! The important thing about the library is you don't have to buy anything to work on things or read a book.\n\nI got to check a book out!\n\nThis blog post was written at the main branch of the San Francisco Library. Thank you for the fast internet. <3", "label": "personal"}

I\u2019m late writing this post. I saw October was on the topic of multilingualism in a global Web *. I\u2019m very excited to write about this topic for various reasons. Exciting might be an understatement. I\u2019m fucking stoked to write a post about languages!\n\nI grew up as a bilingual in Spanish and English. Then, I learned French in school and the whole travel abroad situation. I consider myself fluent in all three languages. I use them often. As someone who speaks multiple languages, I see the world through different lenses. One could argue that the internet itself is another world. This has allowed me to access different parts of the internet that someone who is a monolingual may not ever get to experience much.\n\nWhen I was growing up and started to learn French: I was very happy to find content so easily. One of the shows, * Code Lyoko * was vital in my learning French. I was able to watch able to watch it in all three languages I speak. It helped make connections and differentiate how the characters expressed themselves in their respective language. Being born and raised in the United States, I have to admit that the multilingual has kept me connected with my roots, and my family and has taught me things. It allows my language skills to evolve as time goes on.\n\nI often use the Mexican version of Google to find the news and look up various things about Latin America. I get more direct to the source. I do this to find more accurate reporting on things happening. When things about Mexico get reported in American media, I often question various aspects of the reporting. American media tends to picture Mexico as this scary place as a whole.\n\nWhen I was a kid, It was hard to find information about my parents\u2019 hometown in Mexico. Trying to find detailed information in English was next to impossible. Wikipedia in Spanish is always a great place to start! It\u2019s so much more satisfying as the page has more information and a lot more footnotes. What better place than to look at a website by the Mexican government to give me the census data of my parent\u2019s hometown? You can\u2019t find this information in English!\n\nThe web shouldn\u2019t be dominated by the English language. I\u2019m aware it\u2019s the lingua franca. The internet is becoming homogenized. A world being homogenized is a terrifying thing to think about. We\u2019re losing so much culture. So much perspective. Think of it this way: the internet is losing its spice. It\u2019s becoming bland. We should be proud of the languages we can present ourselves in. That\u2019s what makes the internet fun! Does everything need to be in English? Absolutely N-O-T!\n\nI must admit that I am guilty of not writing as often in different languages. I do write the occasional post in Spanish or French. At the same time, I feel as if I\u2019m contributing to the situation. This month\u2019s topic has motivated me to continue to write in Spanish and French more. I want to continue to express myself. It\u2019s important to write in different languages other than English. When I write in different languages, I express myself as me but at the same time, it\u2019s a different me. French Pablo presents himself differently from Spanish or English Pablo.\n\nThank you ~zinricky for hosting this month\u2019s IndieWeb Carnival on multilingualism in a global Web", "label": "personal"}

I was very happy that I went with my friend!\n\nMy biggest achievement is I didn't fall on my face!

I also don't wan't to give too many spoilers.\n\nBooks:\n\nA Thousand Splendid Suns - Khaled Hosseini\n\nMaus / Maus II - Art Spiegelman\n\nA graphic novel where Spiegelman interviews his father about his experiences as a Polish Jew and Holocaust survivor. *I really enjoyed the various themes in the book.\n\nThis is a must read\n\n1984 - George Orwell\n\nThis taught me many lessons and how eerie this period of time is currently. I'm pretty scared for what's to come.\n\nThe Odyssey - Homer\n\nMany of the themes taught me some important lessons.\n\nIn The Hot Zone - Kevin Sites\n\nThis wasn't my favorite book but it made me aware of various wars and situations happening beyond Iraq.\n\nLady of the Lake - Sir Walter Scott\n\nYeruldelgger - Ian Manook (French)\n\nThis book me realize I can actually read French.\n\nRyan White My Own Story - Ryan White\n\nRyan White has always been an inspiration to me as I have in various periods of my life been involved with bringing awareness about HIV/AIDS. It fascinated me how well-versed Ryan was and his outlook on life as he was very unlucky getting the virus from tainted blood products.\n\nLe Gone du Cha\u00e2ba - Azouz Begag (French)\n\nLe Gone du Cha\u00e2ba (The Kid of the Chaaba), translated into English as Shantytown Kid by Naima Wolf.\n\nI love this book as it shows the struggles of balancing two different cultures - the country you live in and the culture at home. This book understood me in various ways as I struggled to balance US life and my Mexican culture.\n\nMy French Professor gave me this book as a graduation gift.\n\nRemaking Manhood: Stories From the Front Lines of Change - Mark Greene\n\nI read this book right before I graduated college. Being a male teacher is very important as many students don't have a good male role model at home. I made it a goal in my teaching to help my students not fall for certain behaviors.\n\nThis book also helped me reevaluate my relationships and look deep inside of me.\n\nHere's a good link related to Remaking Manhood\n\nWinning the War On War - Joshua S. Goldstein\n\nI minored in International Studies and this book really opened me up to deeper issues that continue to exist.\n\nConstructive Living - David K. Reynolds\n\nAlthough this book wasn't the solution to many of my problems during some very dark times, it has helped me address them and find the right direction. It has helped me get out of the rut.\n\nJourney To The Future: A Roadmap for Success for Youth - Consuelo Castillo Kickbusch (Author)\n\nThis book has helped me in various ways to get where I am today. Consuela is a great presenter!\n\nThe New Koreans: The Story of a Nation - Michael Breen", "label": "personal"}

Everyone and anyone is welcome to participate! I love reading posts in different languages!\n\nSend me a webmention or email me at pablo[at]lifeofpablo.com to submit your posts. I will create a round up post and i will update this blog post with the replies I receive!\n\nWhat is self-expression?\n\nThat depends\n\nself-expression (noun)\n\nself-ex\u00b7\u200bpres\u00b7\u200bsion \u02ccself-ik-\u02c8spre-sh\u0259n\n\nThe expression of one's personality : assertion of one's individual traits\n\nSelf-expression comes in various forms. It manifests differently in every person. There is no single route to how people develop how they become. People express themselves loudly, quietly, non-verbally, or in any other way. Many things influence us in our lives. The environment we grew up in influences how we present to the world. Our cultural backgrounds, the countries we've lived in, the languages we speak, or the type of supportive friends we have in our lives are all the ingredients that build the recipe for who we become and how we share our personalities with the world.\n\nFor me, I love speaking languages! I love playing games in French and being super duper competitive. I love reading in Spanish!\n\nI grew up in a Mexican household which has greatly influenced my ways of self-expression. I love speaking with more emotion at home and being surrounded by people with my cultural background. An example of this is when I am angry, I will cuss in Spanish like no other. I feel so much better after letting it all out. This Instagram reel in Spanish will tell you what I mean.\n\nThe Mexican culture influences my American side and vice versa. I would consider myself very expressive in English. Ever since I was a kid, I loved saying, \"That's so cute\" or \"That flower is so pretty.\" Sharing your emotions is very beautiful. Don't be afraid of saying things out loud like this. Fuck that toxic masculinity garbage!\n\nI love blogging and journaling. I love having a journal - getting lost in my thoughts while jotting them down on beautiful lined or dotted paper on a park bench or sitting crisscross applesauce on the top of a building in San Francisco. I love sharing my thoughts publicly blogging or quietly on paper. Not all forms of expression have to be public. Self-expression also includes time when it's you and only you involved. This includes recording audio notes, coding your new blog engine, or building an arcade cabinet. Alone time is self-expression.\n\nAs I've become older, I've stopped caring as much about what people perceive of me (or what I thought people perceived of me) in the things that interest me. Self-expression is about how comfortable you can be with yourself. It comes down to loving yourself more every day. I love dressing in bright colors, especially on a nice sunny day. It makes me feel great and brightens my mood. Heck, find me wearing the brightest pink shirt out in public in the streets of San Francisco.\n\nHow you view self-expression is open to interpretation. How do you self-express?\n\nHere are some questions to get you started to get the juices flowing:\n\nHow do you present yourself to the world?\n\nWhat does self-expression do for you?\n\nDo you use self-expression as a coping mechanism?\n\nWhat has been your journey to becoming a more expressive version of yourself?\n\nIf your family culture is different from the country that you live in, how do you balance your self-expression? Are they intertwined?\n\nAlso posted on IndieNews\n\nSubmissions", "label": "personal"}

Woohoo! I guess I\u2019m no longer a 20-something-year-old. These last 10 years have flown by quickly but man, have they been memorable. It\u2019s a tad bitter sweet. The positive overtakes the negative by a long shot. I can\u2019t stop the aging process. If only it were that easy!\n\nHonestly, at this very moment, I don\u2019t feel any different. I still feel energetic and craving adventure. I think these song lyrics from T-Swizzle describe how I feel.\n\n(Hey!) I don't know about you But I'm feeling twenty-two\n\nIn hindsight, looking at myself in the mirror more recently, I notice my facial hair is starting to turn white. Nothing like a fresh shave that still makes me look young and boyish. I must being doing something right with my skin routine (and maybe good genes from my parents)!\n\nReflections\n\nI reflect on the growth I\u2019ve had since I entered my 20s. My 20s were about\n\nLearning\n\nFalling and rising\n\nGoing on adventures.\n\nLoved ones\n\nI learned some great lessons along the way. Some lessons were not so easy to swallow. Man, did I learn. There are so many things I know now that I wish a 20-year-old me knew. One of the things I wish he knew was, \u201cLove yourself more!\u201d I do love myself more than ever. I\u2019m happier with who I\u2019ve become. I\u2019m not done learning who I become. I don\u2019t think that ever stops. There were many moments in life when I hit my absolute lowest. Those are moments I\u2019m not proud of. While I did manage to get myself out of them, I did come back stronger. Another lesson here - ask for help and use the resources available to you. You\u2019re not alone, I promise.\n\nTake risks! Take more! I'm thrilled to have moved to California. I still can\u2019t believe that this guy from Nebraska moved to San Francisco. I was grateful to have gone on so many adventures. I learned so much about myself getting away. Some of my best learning moments have been from strangers and experiences with myself in another country. Who knew you could learn something so new about yourself at 3 am while eating a d\u00f5ner kebab on the streets of Berlin?\n\nWhen I was in my early 20s, I said something along the lines of, \u201cI get to be away from my parents! Freedom!\u201d When I was in college, I didn\u2019t want to come home as often, or if I went home to visit, I would not stay for too long. Now more than ever, I miss my parents. Now, I live far away from them. I only get to have home-cooked meals a few times a year. It honestly makes me sad watching them get older. I still need my parents. I do my best to call every day. My relationship with them has been stronger than ever. I am thankful for all the things they\u2019ve done for me and my siblings\n\nWho\u2019s cutting the internet onions on here?\n\nTravel\n\nI\u2019m very fortunate that I traveled a lot in my 20s. I want to thank my parents for taking us to Mexico as a young kid.\n\nI\u2019ve traveled to Canada, all over Europe, South Korea, Mexico, and various parts of the United States.\n\nTravel Buddies\n\nI got to travel with my favorite travel buddies, Sammy and Manny! We've have gone on some wild adventures. I\u2019m very happy we stayed friends. Best travel buddies ever!\n\nBest Birthday Ever! - Czech Republic\n\nOne of my favorite birthdays was when I was studying abroad in Europe. I visited my friends in the Czech Republic.\n\nPablo\u2019s 22nd birthday in 2017 in Czech Republic]\n\nFriends\n\nI\u2019ve made an amazing community of friends. People, I consider my family away from home. Learning from people whom I loved, making friends wherever I go! I\u2019ve made so many friends.\n\nWhat goals do I have in my 30s?\n\nThere are a lot of things I want to accomplish during my 30s. I have a vision for the next few years! I\u2019m hopeful I can find the right path to reach my goals\n\nEducation\n\nI truly value education. It got me where I am today! I was very fortunate to receive a great public school education. Others also need to have access to a great public school education. We must fight against the privatization of the education system. I want to continue to fight for public education. Public education provided me with so many opportunities.\n\nI am currently doing my master\u2019s degree at the University of Nebraska Kearney. My goal one day is to teach a class or two at the university level. It would be awesome to guide future teachers and help them be confident with technology use and go beyond 21st-century learning. I do miss being in the classroom.\n\nI would like to receive a PhD.\n\nI also want to improve my programming skills.\n\nHealth\n\nI\u2019m working towards getting in better shape and thinking of long-term health. As I age, I know I won\u2019t bounce back from injury as quickly. I know I must do everything in my power to take control of my health. Preventative measures are what will keep the hospital away. Mental health is just as important.\n\nAdventures\n\nI want to continue traveling. I want to visit more parts of the world. Ever since I last renewed my passport, the visa pages have been blank. The passport I had in my early twenties was pretty full. It\u2019s so satisfying to look at the stamps and stickers on each page. I want to take my parents on a fun adventure as well\n\nStartup\n\nI\u2019ve been helping a friend with a startup and launching an idea that we have. I am hopeful this year will be great!\n\nFinancial Independence\n\nI want to make smarter choices with money. I\u2019ve been reading up on financial literature to become better with money. Times are changing, and I must keep up with inflation, changing markets, AI, etc.\n\nLooking Forward\n\nOverall, things are finally clicking. I\u2019m excited for what\u2019s to come and all the things to learn. I will reevaluate and reprioritize many things in life.\n\nWhat have you learned in your 30s?\n\nHow am I celebrating my birthday?\n\nLuckily, I live in San Francisco, so there\u2019s a lot to do! I will be celebrating the entire weekend with my friends in San Francisco! So stoked to watch Drag Disco with Trixie Mattel! Let\u2019s put on some pink clothes and dance into my 30s!", "label": "personal"}

But I\u2019m not having a crisis about my personal life choices\u2026 instead I\u2019m having a crisis of generational impotence. I\u2019m tired of waiting for my generation\u2019s turn, which I am less and less convinced will come in time to make a difference, especially since GenZ seems to be going conservative \ud83d\ude11\n\nOuter South by Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band\n\nI finally got letters back from two of my reps:\n\nSenator Murray, 74yo and in office since 1993 when I was in third grade, wants me to know that she \u201cremain[s] committed to continuing to work with [her] colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find ways to make progress on immigration reform.\u201d Thank you for your complacency Senator. I don\u2019t know how immigration progress will be made with isolationist Nazis tbh \ud83e\uddd0 I don\u2019t get why Dems are taking conservative immigration stances when in my mind the problem is we are too strict on immigration, and should let in more people. There, birth rate \u201ccrisis\u201d solved too! What I want to know now is, what are the Senator\u2019s plans for retirement?\n\nRepresentative DelBene\u2019s office thinks I \u201cmay be pleased to know that [she] joined [her] Democratic colleagues in sending a letter to President Trump expressing serious concern about Mr. Abrego Garcia\u2019s case and requesting an immediate update on his wellbeing and how the administration plans to ensure his safe return to the United States.\u201d I am, in fact, not pleased. I am the opposite of pleased. Is she fucking with me? Does she not go on the Internet? In what world am I satisfied that she signed a strongly worded letter and called it good?\n\nMy resentment towards 80yo politicians who won\u2019t retire and pass their power to the next generation is reaching a rolling boil as the Democrats in charge apparently don\u2019t have an ounce of urgency left in their moldering bodies. I have to think it\u2019s intentional, especially given the way Nancy and co blocked Millennial AOC from a position of power in favor of an old dude with cancer who just died from it (\u201cGerry\u2019s a young 74, cancer notwithstanding\u201d \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44); I think Boomer politicians know how badly they\u2019ve fucked over everyone younger than them, and they will literally hold power until they die to prevent facing justice. (Yeah I\u2019m making it generational, they\u2019ve been demonizing Millennials to avoid looking in the mirror for decades.) They booted 25yo David Hogg from DNC leadership as punishment for suggesting the party should not always support incumbents, making a mockery of DEI principles by using gender equality rules to invalidate his election.\n\nA friend and I just looked it up: Nancy Pelosi was first elected in 1987. She has been in power for basically my entire life. And I am turning 40. Her legacy, in my mind? Losing women the right to bodily autonomy, for not taking Republicans seriously and doing anything about it when she could have. OK fine she did get us the ACA. Thanks lady. But it\u2019s time to go home, get some rest, and let someone else have a turn! (Sorry Bernie, I love ya man, but you too!!!)\n\nI think those in charge should have some stakes in the game. If you\u2019re already past the actuarial tables, you shouldn\u2019t get to make decisions for the rest of us who are going to live in the world our politicians make for potentially decades. (I expect the Supreme Court will be ultra conservative for the rest of my life because Dems wouldn\u2019t dare trying to expand it.) Be a mentor, yes, please! But give up the power. Normal retirement age is 67. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ageist to suggest it might be time for someone two decades past retirement age to pass the torch.\n\nGive me a party with energy, give me politicians who fight! Oh, for an opposition party \ud83e\udd7a I don\u2019t have to agree 100% with them, if they\u2019d just have some gumption. Give me AOC energy, Shawn Fain energy, Pete Buttigieg (!) energy, Cory Booker energy, Chris Van Hollen energy, Kat Abughazaleh energy. Not whatever this pathetic excuse for \u201cleadership\u201d is. Walz had the energy and they told him to stuff it. Brilliant strategy guys.\n\nPlease, please tell me someone is primarying all my Federal reps next election, because I will vote for anyone who shows some semblance of spine \ud83d\ude21", "label": "personal"}

I\u2019ve made so many friends.\n\nWhat goals do I have in my 30s?\n\nThere are a lot of things I want to accomplish during my 30s. I have a vision for the next few years! I\u2019m hopeful I can find the right path to reach my goals\n\nEducation\n\nI truly value education. It got me where I am today! I was very fortunate to receive a great public school education. Others also need to have access to a great public school education. We must fight against the privatization of the education system. I want to continue to fight for public education. Public education provided me with so many opportunities.\n\nI am currently doing my master\u2019s degree at the University of Nebraska Kearney. My goal one day is to teach a class or two at the university level. It would be awesome to guide future teachers and help them be confident with technology use and go beyond 21st-century learning. I do miss being in the classroom.\n\nI would like to receive a PhD.\n\nI also want to improve my programming skills.\n\nHealth\n\nI\u2019m working towards getting in better shape and thinking of long-term health. As I age, I know I won\u2019t bounce back from injury as quickly. I know I must do everything in my power to take control of my health. Preventative measures are what will keep the hospital away. Mental health is just as important.\n\nAdventures\n\nI want to continue traveling. I want to visit more parts of the world. Ever since I last renewed my passport, the visa pages have been blank. The passport I had in my early twenties was pretty full. It\u2019s so satisfying to look at the stamps and stickers on each page. I want to take my parents on a fun adventure as well\n\nStartup\n\nI\u2019ve been helping a friend with a startup and launching an idea that we have. I am hopeful this year will be great!\n\nFinancial Independence\n\nI want to make smarter choices with money. I\u2019ve been reading up on financial literature to become better with money. Times are changing, and I must keep up with inflation, changing markets, AI, etc.\n\nLooking Forward\n\nOverall, things are finally clicking. I\u2019m excited for what\u2019s to come and all the things to learn. I will reevaluate and reprioritize many things in life.\n\nWhat have you learned in your 30s?\n\nHow am I celebrating my birthday?\n\nLuckily, I live in San Francisco, so there\u2019s a lot to do! I will be celebrating the entire weekend with my friends in San Francisco! So stoked to watch Drag Disco with Trixie Mattel! Let\u2019s put on some pink clothes and dance into my 30s!", "label": "personal"}

It wasn\u2019t ever as big as my parent\u2019s, but I had ~50-70 jazz CDs (donated to the local HS music department so hopefully someone\u2019s still using them) plus probably a hundred albums.

I\u2019ve only bought one or two CDs a year for the past decade, indie bands I wanted to give some extra support (and listen in the car).\n\nThere\u2019s something about having a tangible object that makes it easier to flip through your collection and pull out things you haven\u2019t listened to in a while.

They both really needed replacing. We\u2019d hoped to have it done before the winter started since our furnace had already been on the fritz for several years \u2014 but the equipment was on backorder.\n\nMy energy utility, Puget Sound Energy (PSE), wants people to stay on gas, so there weren\u2019t incentives from them for this switch; however, my city developed a bulk purchase and incentive program to assist homeowners in transitioning to support the community\u2019s climate goals. This upgrade electrified our whole house, so we could shut off our gas service!*\n\nNow that I\u2019ve had a heat pump for a year, I wanted to share my experience, because I had questions and misconceptions that I didn\u2019t get answered beforehand. Tl;dr it\u2019s great, especially the cooling, just works a little differently.\n\n(Heads-up: 2500 word post, but it\u2019s got graphs! \ud83e\udd29)\n\n*Technically we still have a gas fireplace installed, but we never used it. PSE said it was safe to simply turn off even if that means there might be a small amount of gas remaining in the pipes under the house.\n\nWhy we got a heat pump\n\nOur old setup was failing\n\nBefore the upgrade, we had a ~20 year old gas furnace and an old gas water heater. In November 2019, a pipe on our water heater ruptured, spraying a ton of scalding water into our garage ceiling, filling the entire garage with steam that we had to hire a company to install fans for days to dry out. After that, the furnace began to fail regularly, falsely tripping the safety shut-off and needing to be restarted multiple times a day. We had people out to fix it multiple times, but the most they could figure was that something inside was corroded and they\u2019d clean it to buy us another few months.\n\nMy husband\u2019s telecommuted for years, and during the pandemic, I started working from home too \u2014 but the only \u201ccooling\u201d we had was a ceiling fan in our living room and dining room. We bought a used portable electric window A/C unit to keep my husband\u2019s office from turning into an inferno, and hefted it down the hall to our bedroom in the evenings. Less than ideal.\n\nNatural gas is terrible for the planet and for people\n\n\u201cNatural gas\u201d is the greenwashed industry name for methane, an extremely potent greenhouse gas. A lot of methane is fracked, which may have impacts on the health of surrounding communities. Methane is piped, often through First Nation people\u2019s lands without permission \u2014 think Keystone XL and Canada\u2019s Coastal GasLink pipeline \u2014 where it may leak and harm the water and ecosystem. Also, some methane leaks during fracking and distribution, contributing to emissions.\n\nMoreover, \u201cnatural gas\u201d is propped up by corporate propaganda that cooking with gas is better than electric, despite the atrocious impact methane has on indoor air quality and its contribution to household emissions. I have an electric stove, so I didn\u2019t have to replace mine in order to get off gas.\n\nWithout gas-burning appliances, our risk of carbon monoxide poisoning is lowered; it would come from some other source, like operating a propane stove indoors (DO NOT DO THAT THING). My husband knows someone who has brain damage from carbon monoxide poisoning!\n\nBasically, \u201cnatural gas\u201d is fucking shit and I want fucking nothing to do with it.\n\nMy new all-electric home energy setup\n\nMy house is about 1400s.f. and has two stories. It was built in the 1980s and our attic doesn\u2019t have enough insulation (we\u2019ve replaced insulation in the basement but not yet dealt with the attic).\n\nMitsubishi heat pump air handler (SVZ-KP24NA) \u2014 24,000 BTU/hour\n\nGeneral Aire residential whole-house air cleaner (GFI #4422 or 4424)\n\nMitsubishi wall head (split-type air conditioner MSZ-GL15NA) \u2014 one unit installed on second floor \u2014 we considered a second but decided to save $$$\n\n\n\n50-gallon electric water heater \u2014 the installer recommended against tankless despite what I\u2019d read online \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\n18-panel / 5.04kW solar system (Itek IT280 photovoltaic modules and Itek Theia HE\u2010t UL 3.8 kW inverter) \u2014 installed in 2015\n\nThe air handler connects to our existing duct system. There\u2019s the outdoor unit, which we placed on the side of the house directly below the upstairs heat pump head, and there\u2019s also the air cleaner in the garage where the old furnace was.\n\nThe city bulk purchase program we went through offered Mitsubishi heat pumps, and we just went with what the contractor recommended.\n\nHow much did the heat pump and electric water heater cost?\n\nI am located in the Seattle area, which has been in a housing boom for a while so contractors are pretty expensive.\n\nThe heat pump cost $19,445 + 10.2% tax for equipment and installation. The permit cost $236.*\n\nThe electric water heater with new dedicated 220v circuit cost $2,145 + 10.2% tax.\n\nOur city provided a $500 incentive and coordinated a $1,200 discount for bulk purchase of equipment, so in total we paid $22,155 for both heat pump and new water heater.\n\n*The permit included an inspection, which failed the first time \u2014 we wouldn\u2019t have known what wasn\u2019t installed quite right, so thanks inspector! He was super helpful and pointed out some other unrelated things he noticed that we might consider acting on.\n\nHeat pump vs. gas furnace energy use comparisons\n\nMy situation will not be directly comparable to most people\u2019s because we have a solar array, but hopefully will still provide a relative comparison. I have provided the electricity we used, which includes power we generated and used directly, but not power we generated and sold back to PSE.\n\nUnfortunately since we upgraded the water heater at the same time, we can\u2019t isolate only the cost of the heat pump \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nObnoxiously, our power bill comes mid-month. To make life easier for myself in the graphs, I\u2019ve represented the month the bill was issued. That typically covers usage from the 18th of the previous month through the 17th of the billing month \ud83d\ude15\n\nContext: weather and energy trends in the Pacific Northwest\n\nFor usage context, in the Seattle area, it\u2019s relatively cool (and we run heating) from mid September through early June. Summer is usually relatively moderate, typically peaking with one or two weeks in the 90s (F). Over 100F is unusual.\n\nHow much more electricity did the heat pump use?\n\nThese data represent solely our electricity use, so you can guesstimate how much electricity we use for heating (and cooling) by how much our electricity increased after January 2023. During the cold months (December through March bills), we used about 1200-1500 additional kWh (for heating our space and water). Over the whole year, we used an additional 7300kWh compared to the previous year. (According to PSE, it\u2019s typical to use about 2800kWh annually for an electric water heater and 6800kWh for a heat pump, or 9600kWh annually.)\n\nYou\u2019ll see that we had a big jump in electricity use in January 2024 (technically mid December through mid January). This coincides with an extremely cold snap for Washington, with temperatures in the ~19 degree Fahrenheit range for about a week. We didn\u2019t adjust our thermostat during that time period, but did run the heat pump head overnight as well as pulled out a small standalone electric space heater to help keep the house warmer during the day.\n\nMonthly kWh electricity used, Sept. 16 2021-Jan. 17, 2024 Month 2021 2022 2023 2024 kWh difference\n\nwith heat pump 1 499 495 1946 1451 2 419 *1044 *625 3 545 1737 1192 4 681 1617 936 5 695 1120 425 6 531 993 462 7 1003 1213 210 8 1212 1059 -153 9 868 973 105 10 577 721 880 159 11 466 541 1274 733 12 430 500 1651 1151\n\nbold = electric only \u2014 heat pump installed January 30, 2023\n\n* About half the February 2023 billing cycle was on gas heat\n\n\n\nHow much methane usage did we eliminate?\n\nIn 2022, we used 770 therms of methane.* Now, we use none! \ud83d\ude4c\n\n*According to PSE, a typical house uses 690 therms for a gas furnace and 160 therms for a gas water heater, or 850 therms annually.\n\nComparing gas therms and kWh electricity\n\nA therm is equal to approximately 29 kWh. Unless I\u2019m being totally unreasonable in converting and combining these values, here\u2019s how the overall kWh shakes out \u2014 a massive reduction in energy used with the heat pump (Feb 2023-Jan 2024):\n\nHow much did it cost to run the heat pump versus the gas furnace?\n\nThe first month we used the heat pump for cooling, I was braced for a radical energy bill, but thanks to our solar panels, we continued to pay the minimum electrical charge in summer \ud83e\uddbe\n\nIn actual costs, we paid $1435 for energy (gas and electricity) in 2022 and $1158 in 2023 (heat pump only); if we assumed that the four summer months of 2022 were $7.95 as in a normal year, that would still put 2022 at $1215. And if we swapped in this year\u2019s all-electric January bill for last year\u2019s gas-heated bill, that\u2019s basically a wash. And now we have whole-house cooling in summer \ud83d\ude0e\n\nMonthly energy bill by year, Sept. 16 2021-Jan. 17, 2024 Month 2021 2022 2023 2024 1 $218.41 *$229.79 $260.96 2 $158.67 $202.26 3 $148.30 $188.41 4 $108.26 $91.73 5 $79.85 $28.09 6 $51.67 $7.95 7 *$36.18 $7.95 8 *$76.16 $7.95 9 *$86.90 $7.95 10 $71.32 *$84.62 $46.02 11 $101.87 *$161.19 $136.05 12 $143.28 *$224.62 $204.68\n\nbold = electric only \u2014 heat pump installed January 30, 2023\n\n* = our solar inverter was not selling electricity back to PSE these months, though was generating power for pass-through usage \u2014 in a normal year the summer month costs would be the minimum $7.95 \u2014 this also means there was no bank to draw from for those fall and winter months\n\nWhat I wish we\u2019d known before switching to a heat pump\n\nIt heats differently than a gas furnace: slow and steady versus bursts of heat\n\nThe first month we had our heat pump, in the cold of February 2023, I was convinced it was broken or we\u2019d been sold too small of a unit. If you go in with expectations that it\u2019s going to be a different heating experience than a gas furnace, you\u2019ll be happier than I was at first \ud83d\ude09\n\nBeing used to a gas furnace, we were used to saying, \u201cIt\u2019s cold!\u201d and bumping the thermostat* up a couple degrees, then getting the immediate feedback of a big blast of hot air and a relatively quick increase in temperature.\n\nIn contrast, the heat pump blows air lightly all day long**. If we increase the thermostat setting, it will take several hours to reach the new temperature. Likewise, when it\u2019s too cold out, sometimes it has a hard time keeping up. (I\u2019m hoping that upping our attic insulation will help hold the temperature better.)\n\n*We had a Nest before, but I don\u2019t think it actually helped save energy since we were home all day every day, so between that and Google\u2019s creepy surveillance I was fine when I found out the heat pump came with a thermostat and wouldn\u2019t work with the Nest. Unfortunately, the included thermostat is kind of annoying to program.\n\n**Because heat pumps blow constantly, the contractor recommended keeping as many vents open as possible \u2014 closing no more than one or two. (There was a technical reason for this that I forget, something about making part of the heat pump get too cold and shut down.) Unfortunately, whoever installed our original HVAC system was, er, clearly the low bidder, so we have wacky vents directly underneath windows and doors all over the house \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f The register that blows the hottest is our downstairs bathroom \ud83d\ude44\n\nSo, with the heat pump, we don\u2019t drop the temperature overnight as much as we did with the gas furnace. We keep the house a more consistent temperature all the time. Then, the poor heat pump isn\u2019t always struggling to keep up, it just holds what it\u2019s got.\n\nThe heads aren\u2019t as quiet as they\u2019re made out to be\n\nWhoever says they\u2019re basically silent hasn\u2019t paid much attention. The heat pump head (which is in our bedroom) makes mysterious noises pretty often, particularly when in heating mode*. My poor cat Mina stares at it, transfixed in horror, as it tinkles like broken glass going through the wash, whooshes like the house is blasting off, brrrs to life unexpectedly, and whirs as the louvers rotate up and down randomly. It sometimes makes noise even when the unit is turned off, which is confusing.\n\nThe fan noises are relatively quiet, especially in comparison with a window AC unit, so that\u2019s probably the frame of reference people have when they talk about it being silent. But it\u2019s not silent if you\u2019re changing from forced air, which actually is basically silent \ud83d\ude09 Overall, it\u2019s not too intrusive and totally worth it for being able to fine-tune the comfort level of our bedroom, but not quite what I had anticipated.\n\n*I am pretty sensitive to noise, but my husband and cats agree on this one \ud83d\ude09\n\nOur verdict: the heat pump is a huge win for summer, good for winter\n\nIt kicks ass in summer\n\nWow, after previously not having cooling in summer, it was incredible to be able to comfortably use my office after like 3pm in the summer \ud83d\ude02 I was especially the beneficiary because in the past my husband got the portable A/C unit since his office was hotter.\n\nThe heat pump couldn\u2019t keep up with the hottest days in the high nineties, but even then still kept the house in comfortable mid to high eighties \u2014 totally fine for us, especially with a ceiling fan.\n\nGood in normal cold, fine in cold cold\n\nOnce we learned how to program the thermostat appropriately, we\u2019ve been happy with how the heat pump keeps the house warm.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest: this thing struggles with the cold cold (below freezing). From my understanding, actually cold places use a backup furnace IIRC, but the temperature\u2019s generally moderate enough in Seattle that we get by with just a heat pump and suck it up for the one or two extra-cold weeks a year.\n\nDuring our recent cold snap, when it was 16 degrees Fahrenheit overnight one night, the house was 55 degrees when we went downstairs in the morning despite the thermostat being set to 68. It didn\u2019t heat up much during the morning, so we pulled out our little electric space heater and an electric heating pad to boost the warmth, and bundled up with down vests and blankets. This is where the heat pump head is key: we were able to keep our bedroom, where the head is located, comfortable overnight (though we did add extra blankets).\n\nAnd honestly? The heat pump\u2019s so much more efficient, better for the climate, and safer for us that wearing a jacket for a week or two in the winter seems like a totally reasonable tradeoff.", "label": "personal"}

We have collected seeds and plants from Tibet, Europe and elsewhere and enjoy a very English style profusion with lawn and intertwined stairs and hidden trails.\u201d (This garden was very much my vibe.)\n\nTakeaways\n\nIt\u2019s lovely to see stunning gardens like these, but also having paid for landscaping, I have to distinguish between what someone could accomplish with many tens of thousands of dollars of hardscaping and what could be adaptable to my yard. Some of the gardens leaned on sweat equity and cleverness, which is what my budget calls for \ud83d\ude09 Boulders are $$$ as much as I love how they look \ud83e\udd7a (Our landscape plan originally called for a fountain but the landscaper wasn\u2019t willing to wait for electricity to be trenched, since it would need an inspection, even though they saw the plans when we got the quote \ud83d\ude44 so, we have a bird bath)\n\nI think some cheapish landscaping cobblestones, metal arches, and more yard art could go a fair ways to adding finish to my garden. I also suspect another couple Japanese maples could pull things together. More paths / focal points in the backyard would be beneficial visually \u2014 we didn\u2019t bother because the freeway is so loud we just wanted it to look pretty out the window \u2014 but I\u2019m finding that there is a lack of places for the eye to land when it\u2019s all green all the time. Without a lawn, and with the path so close to the house you can\u2019t see it from inside, we have few \u201cedges\u201d.", "label": "personal"}

Outright fascism is worse, but there are plenty of things we need to change. Kat Abughazaleh, who\u2019s running for office in Illinois, says:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason every American should not be able to afford housing, groceries, health insurance, public transit (ideally), and then still have enough money to save and take your kid to the zoo or go to the movies with your friends. There\u2019s just, there\u2019s no reason \u2014 we are the wealthiest country in the world. The idea that that\u2019s unrealistic or idealistic or naive or even called childish, I think that\u2019s sucky.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t have to settle for returning to a normal that sucks \u2014 but protest may not be enough to force change. Our current situation has been the Republican gameplan for decades; we will not escape it by liberating ourselves from a single politician. Trump is a symptom, but the rot runs much deeper. We need to reckon emotionally with the long fights ahead; protests alone will not solve our problems. I\u2019m not saying protest isn\u2019t helpful or important \u2014 I\u2019m saying that we need to find space for both brunch and advocacy in our lives. Micah L. Sifry writes:\n\nOne of the most inspiring ways that pro-democracy movements grow their strength is by inventing and spreading ways for the silent majority to make itself both visible and influential.\n\nI\u2019ve been seeing organizers talking about the need to transform the current energy into long-term work, and not let it fizzle out. Jared Yates Sexton describes the way that authorities rein in public speech:\n\nWe are, according to those who want nothing more than to maintain control, supposed to protest enough, but not too much. Because we should rely on them. Because we need to maintain our subservient position under the party as opposed to in conversation and discourse with the party.\n\nOne strategy: focusing on local advocacy and building up\n\nMy pet theory is that most people should spend their advocacy time supporting local (and state) efforts, and donate to organizations advocating at the federal level. The collapse of local news and intense media focus on national politics encourages people to feel powerless because at the federal level most of what you can do is harass your senator. It also frames politics as something \u201cyou do\u201d once every four years for normies, every two years for the passionate, every election for the wonks and zealots. If you get people involved in local politics, I imagine that get-out-the-vote drives become a lot easier because people are already tuned in.\n\nThe local level is more influential than people realize, I suspect. In Washington State, how environmental policies often play out is that they get implemented at either King County or City of Seattle first, then several suburban cities, and then there\u2019s a model and coalition for building a state-level policy. As former city staff, I can say it\u2019s no accident it works this way \u2014 we knew our colleagues at other cities and would learn from each other, sharing lessons and draft policy language. Regional organizations support, both partnering with cities and going down to Olympia during the legislative session to advocate for (and against) bills. We know that Republicans followed a similar model in the evil direction in red states, building up a portfolio of harmful policies to bring to the federal level in the form of Project 2025\u2026 why don\u2019t we do the same for progressive policies?\n\nIf we start thinking and working now, we can set things up for the next state legislative session, then the next federal election, then the presidential election. (I\u2019m not going down rabbitholes about martial law, I don\u2019t find it helpful to indulge in that kind of despairing fatalism \u2014 I think my personal work on managing catastrophic thinking and anxiety has paid dividends here.)\n\nI haven\u2019t decided what bigger thing I want to work on yet\u2026 for now I\u2019ve just been doing ad hoc advocacy when it\u2019s pointed out by the urbanist Discord server I\u2019m in. I\u2019m pissed that Washington had a school lunch bill that failed in the legislative session, so potentially supporting another run at that\u2026 or badgering the governor about Washington\u2019s regressive taxation policy and demanding an income tax on the wealthiest Washingtonians, which he put the kibosh on this budget cycle and was why the budget was too tight to feed kids \ud83d\ude44 Come on, Bob! We have a lot of tech companies \u2014 and tech CEOs \u2014 here who could stand to pay their fair share. Or I could go harder on supporting housing; I just looked at King County\u2019s affordable housing dashboard, which identifies a need for 44,000 affordable units by 2024, and THE ENTIRE SEATTLE AREA HAD BUILT FEWER THAN FIVE THOUSAND UNITS by 2022. *screaming*\n\nOrganizing coalitions\n\nI\u2019m also spinning on the provocation of the second method of organizing described in the Win the Midwest\u2019s 10-year report (emphasis mine):\n\nThere are two approaches to base building. We can ask what we are for, and then go out and find the people who agree with us. Or we can begin by asking who we need to organize in order to build enough power to shift everything, and then go where they are: workplaces, churches, mosques, synagogues, schools, and childcare centers. Grassroots organizations that meet people where they are \u2013 physically and ideologically \u2013 and that create spaces of belonging, learning, and formation rooted in people\u2019s lives and experiences have an unlimited number of people to organize. Most people do not have clearly defined political outlooks, but they can move into public leadership roles. Organizations willing to put their base at the center of their plans can co-create a political agenda that emerges from the lived experience of their bases.\n\nI\u2019m an extremely opinionated person, and I know what outcomes I want (though I\u2019d rather listen to others on the best tactics on achieving those outcomes), but maybe I could think of this as prioritizing which outcomes to focus on based on which ones enough other people also want and will fight for. L.A. Kauffman discusses building coalitions with those we disagree with, quoting a 1981 talk / 1983 essay \u201cCoalition Politics: Turning the Century\u201d:\n\n\u201cThe reason we are stumbling,\u201d Dr. [Bernice] Reagon declared all those years ago, \u201cis that we are at the point where in order to take the next step we\u2019ve got to do it with some folk we don\u2019t care too much about. And we got to vomit over that for a little while. We must just keep going.\u201d\n\nFurther reading:\n\nWhy Do Anything? by Dj Bracken \u2014 this guy decided to start paying down student lunch debt in Utah, and eventually helped get a statewide bill passed (I was loosely involved in supporting new \u201cshare tables\u201d / fridges at our local elementary schools, AMA)\n\nFrom Aspiration to Action: Organizing Through Exhaustion, Grief, and Uncertainty by Kelly Hayes\n\nSee also:\n\nDon\u2019t let them say it\u2019s normal\n\nExtending my understanding of self-care\n\nBeing a citizen means taking ownership", "label": "personal"}
{"title": "Creating rituals: remembering Coach Taylor \u2013 Tracy Durnell's Mind Garden", "url": "https://tracydurnell.com/2024/08/16/creating-rituals-remembering-coach-taylor/", "content": "My high school track and cross country coach Mr. Taylor was a master at creating rituals and culture. A former seminary student who was obsessed with ancient Greece, he started each practice with a philosophy discussion. He wove in, too, tales of past runners and triumphs \u2014 he\u2019d been coach for nearly thirty years already \u2014 creating our own pantheon of heroes, the team\u2019s own mythos. Who of us would one day join its ranks?\n\nMr. Taylor recognized how much the mind and body are connected. He treated our labor seriously, and expected us to do the same. Excellence \u2014 ar\u00eate \u2014 was our goal. I\u2019ll admit that plenty of times I tuned out the talk, but there was something about sitting down as a team to transition from school to sport, using that time to mentally prepare for the physical work.\n\nOne of my favorite rituals was to honor outgoing seniors on the cross-country team. At the final home race of the season, each senior released one of his homing pigeons. (I was annoyed because I had to share a pigeon \ud83d\ude02) As far as I can remember, there was no special meaning to this, it just was a thing that he made happen each year. A created ceremony we nonetheless looked forward to; simply having some marker, however arbitrary, gave the season an emotional culmination beyond the final race, recognition of our contributions to the team regardless of how we placed.\n\nHe built the team\u2019s culture through these shared rites and rituals, building a sense of continuity with past runners both at our school and at the origins of track in Ancient Greece.\n\nI can\u2019t talk about ritual and Mr. Taylor without also talking about Ar\u00eate West. Starting in 1979, every other year he took a group of about eight students from the track or cross country team to Greece. At first, they went to compete, but over the years it shifted into more of a philosophical journey and extended into greater Europe. Over the course of twenty trips, the experience developed its own rituals. (I went on trip thirteen.)\n\nThe first: secret invitation. My best friend hounded me, but I wouldn\u2019t confess that I\u2019d received The Postcard telling me when and where our first meeting would be. (We met every other week throughout the school year to study and prepare for the trip.) We all showed up that first night unsure who the seven other voyagers would be. In my year, the eighth person no-showed \u2014 we never found out who else had been invited and declined to join.\n\nThe trip itself teemed with rituals. My least favorite involved running through the hot, dusty Greek countryside to an ancient track where we were expected to take off our shoes and run a lap in bare feet, like the runners of old. On Ithaca, we ran, separately, to \u201cTelemachos\u2019 beach\u201d. In Delphi, we were meant to sleep in \u201cthe meadow\u201d where many past Arete trips had slept (but he couldn\u2019t find it in the twilight, so we slept on a random dirt road \ud83d\ude12 Apparently on my sister\u2019s trip there was a dead dog in the meadow and they said no fucking way).\n\nMr. Taylor believed strongly in the power of place and designed the experience to provoke encounters with meaning. (Some more successful than others\u2026) I lugged my clarinet across Europe so I could play Mozart\u2019s clarinet concerto outside the building where he died (?). Everywhere we went, one or another of us had been assigned topics to present on or locations to give a reading. (I botched my reading from The Agony and The Ecstasy at the Vatican and read a passage about the wrong Michaelangelo Mother and Child sculpture \ud83e\udd23) Overlooking the Acropolis, one of the boys had to read us Pericles\u2019s funeral speech, as each trip had done before us. In Sils Maria, we walked in Nietzsche\u2019s footsteps and discussed quotes at various waypoints along the trail. Our trip was our own, yet inextricably linked with previous trips through shared touchstones and repeated experiences: rituals meant to connect us to the past, both modern and ancient.\n\nThis is my contribution to the August IndieWeb Blog Carnival, hosted by Steve Ledlow on the theme of ritual.", "label": "personal"}
{"title": "A world run by tools", "url": "https://tommorris.org/posts/2024/a-world-run-by-tools/", "content": "Tantek just wrote an interesting post about writing tools, part of an IndieWeb Carnival for last month on tools.\n\nThis is partly a response to Tantek\u2019s post with some suggestions, but also explaining how I pick tools, and explaining a few I use.\n\nZuhandenheit\n\nIf I\u2019m trying to think, or learn something important or come up with ideas, my first port of call is to take notes by hand. There\u2019s some scientific evidence that writing by hand is better if you want to learn stuff, but I also just like writing by hand more. It\u2019s calming and it feels nice. Computers are filled with bugs, security vulnerabilities, bad software, corproate unpleasantness, and endless distractions. None of the things I dislike most about computers are present in pens and notebooks.\n\nI use hardbound notebooks (I\u2019ve tried a variety of brands, but I prefer 120gsm paper and pre-printed page numbers), and black uni-ball Eye UB-157 pens with 0.7mm nibs. I have some of the 1.0mm ones too, but they\u2019re a bit much. I used fountain pens at school and have no particular desire to go back to that particular mess. I used to use another brand of gel pens where you could replace the ink rather than having to dispose of the whole thing when it runs out, which would be a plus.\n\nThe stuff I write down may end up being typed up and stored in a digital system, but about 80% of the time, what I write starts on paper.\n\nThose with an optimizing mindset might find it a bit strange to duplicate effort in this way. Write stuff by hand and then type it into a digital system? Why?\n\nFor me, writing notes and ideas by hand is an important first stage. There are fewer distractions in a notebook. If you write digitally, you go immediately into editing mode - rewriting words, cutting and pasting, chopping and changing. Sometimes that\u2019s important, but there\u2019s an advantage to just letting the thoughts sit around for a bit before getting the scalpel out.\n\n\u201cSure, but what about an iPad with a Apple Pencil? Or a reMarkable? Or just scanning your notebook and using handwriting recognition?\u201d asks a conveniently invented interlocuter.\n\nIf those work for you, great. I have tried taking notes on an iPad with a stylus, and it\u2019s\u2026 fine. I was curious about the reMarkable, but then they added bloody subscription fees. I already have a notebook and a pen. Spending hundreds of pounds on another gadget, plus having to deal with tech nonsense like susbcription fees, and USB chargers - and, for what? I already have a notebook. It\u2019s good.\n\nThe second second stage of typing it up into a digital system isn\u2019t a problem that needs solving, it\u2019s a purposeful decision. The typing up stage is where I add context, reorder and restructure the ideas to make them more coherent, work out what needs to happen with the information\u2014see how things hang together in the broadest possible sense of the term, that kinda thing. Often times, the typing up stage will involve digging out links, finding references, double-checking stuff.\n\nSeparating thinking and writing into separate stages works for me. It takes time, but if the end result is better ideas or clearer understanding, that\u2019s time well spent.\n\nMinimally cursed technology\n\nIn terms of how I pick digital tools, I\u2019m not an free/open source purist, but my starting point is I want stable forever software, free of corporate control, that uses formats that are open, widely-implemented and simple. If it is open source, all the better. If it isn\u2019t, I treat it as considerably more disposable than I do free software.\n\nThere\u2019s commercial software I use which is pay once, or where there\u2019s an \u201cannual pass\u201d type approach that unlocks new features. I avoid SaaS and subscriptionware, not because of the cost, but because of the control. I don\u2019t trust stuff to not go away.\n\nThere are morally disgusting elements in the software industry\u2014Adobe just referred to Creative Cloud users as heroin addicts, and I want no part of that. But there is an incredibly pragmatic, commercial argument for preferring software that\u2019s open source (or at least closer to the Platonic ideal): it seems incredibly risky to hand over control of the tools one relies on to work effectively to companies whose commercial incentives do not necessarily align with your own. They can screw you over at any time, and you\u2019ve got no practical recourse. This is true of everybody whose job involves using technology, which, these days, is practically everyone. It\u2019s true of knowledge workers\u2014scientists, designers, software developers, lawyers, civil servants, journalists\u2014having control over the tools of their work, but it is also just as true of rural farmers being able to repair their tractors or doctors being able to fix ventilators during a global pandemic (they ended up getting more help from a Polish hacker than from the medical device manufacturers).\n\nOn open data, the near guaranteed way to achieve this is plain text. That\u2019s it. The closer to plain text it is, the better.\n\nI\u2019ve worked in companies where our beautifully curated bug tracker\u2014which, along with the commit history, is the closest thing to an oral history of a software project\u2014disappeared because someone decides that they prefer a different system. God only knows why\u2014 it\u2019s 40\u00a2 per user per month cheaper, the sales guy took them for a nice lunch, the icon is a nicer shade of blue. Nobody transferred the data. All the links to the bugs are broken. The consequence? The developers have no idea what happened before last week because it\u2019s all disappeared. If it\u2019s not in text/plain or something close to it (Markdown, HTML, etc.), it dies. If it is in plain text or something close to it, you can version control it, which is handy.\n\nI cannot emphasise enough how important plain text is. It\u2019s unreasonably effective, one might say. The fact that in knowledge-based workplaces and professions, only programmers seem to grasp the significance of this is incredibly strange.\n\nImplementation\n\nIn terms of electronic tooling, my first ports of call for writing are Emacs and Obsidian. Emacs is mostly for code, Obsidian is mostly for prose, but there\u2019s some overlap.\n\nFor Emacs, I use the Doom distro. I used Vim for a long time, and evil-mode gives me Vim but I can customise it more to my needs. In practice, I don\u2019t customise very much, but Emacs Lisp is preferable to Vimscript. And my Emacs setup looks pretty.\n\nWhen it comes to programming, my go-to languages these days are Python and Rust (plus, I guess, Elisp).\n\nAs for Obsidian, it\u2019s where pretty much everything that\u2019s not code and is of longer term importance ends up. It\u2019s a personal wiki, basically. Some people like to call them \u201czettelkastens\u201d or \u201cpersonal knowledge management systems\u201d but I just say \u201cpersonal wiki\u201d. Everything goes in there - notes on interesting things I read, hard-fought lessons, lists of films and music to try.\n\nIt is a genuine extended mind though. The main benefit is thought not going to waste. I\u2019ve been in discussions with people, and we\u2019ve been trying to understand something - I can pull up information from my personal wiki and refresh myself on what did I think when I encountered this thing in the past, and why.\n\nI don\u2019t love Obsidian (it not being open source being one problem). Logseq is promising (and actually open source), but I\u2019ve been too busy to switch over. I\u2019ve tried org-mode and I like it, but Org mode keybindings are weird and I\u2019m too lazy to change them. Plus there isn\u2019t really good mobile tooling in Org-mode world.\n\nBoth Obsidian and Logseq are just plain text which I trust far more than whatever rat-infested proprietary crap is popular until it gets sunsetted or pivoted or screwed up.\n\nIn theory, how you sync Obsidian (and Logseq) is up to you. In practice, if you\u2019re on macOS/iOS, you\u2019ve got a couple of options:\n\niCloud Drive - it\u2019s built into the OS after all\n\nDropbox / Google Drive / whatever - I\u2019ve moved away from them\n\nsome self-hosted thing - Resilio Sync, Syncthing, WebDAV etc.\n\nObsidian\u2019s paid for sync service which is probably lovely but it is $20 a month, no thanks\n\nGit - it\u2019s plain text, version control it\n\nThe latter is great but fiddly if you want to sync between iOS and desktop. This tutorial explains exactly how to do it correctly with Working Copy. Doing it any other way is a recipe for pain and unpleasantness.\n\n(The other way to do it is to have a Git copy, and then some kind of way to sync it to a cloud storage system without the Git repo, then pull the changes back in. Essentially that\u2019s what the Working Copy/Shortcuts trick is doing on iOS.)\n\nI\u2019ve bounced back and forth between Apple Notes and Bear for more trivial, throw-away stuff. Ultimately, that is for short-lived stuff - the important stuff gets checked into the personal wiki, because text/plain wins.\n\nIn terms of this blog, it uses Hugo. Why? Dunno. It\u2019s alright. I chose it because it\u2019s a single binary, and I had previously gotten utterly bored of RubyGems and Python virtualenvs and all that dependency management stuff. There\u2019s stuff I don\u2019t like about it, but I don\u2019t really have time to fix all the issues now.\n\nGo make stuff\n\nWriting and reading about tools is fun, but it is a whole lot of empty calories.\n\nPick the least bad option, try to exercise control over your tools rather than cede it to unpleasant people who want to turn everything on your computer into a satellite TV subscription, with you as a disempowered consumer.\n\nUse the tools you\u2019ve settled on to do things you value: learning stuff, writing, make art, watch cat videos, and your job (optional).

{"title": "Testing the Firefox alternatives", "url": "https://tommorris.org/posts/2024/testing-the-firefox-alternatives/", "content": "Firefox and Mozilla are in a bit of a state. Firefox and Mozilla are always in a bit of a state, but the recent release of Firefox 130 which includes an AI chatbot feature has prompted a lot of head scratching.\n\nYes, I get that some people want it, and you can turn it off. And, no, that is not the issue. The issue is Mozilla are spending a lot of time and effort on chasing the sort of silly AI hype that gets Tony Blair excited. That\u2019s rather disconcerting if you\u2019d like Mozilla to focus on making a good browser instead of chasing the new and shiny because it is new and shiny.\n\n(In their defence: I\u2019ll note that some of the AI stuff Mozilla is pursing is reasonable. The translation feature uses a local model for translation, which is a great idea. It doesn\u2019t support all the languages that Google Translate does, but it\u2019s good. )\n\nAnyway, the rot just goes on. In July, it was the rollout of privacy-preserving attribution (having previously purchased Anonym). Before that, it was the rollout of the ghastly Proton UI, which necessitated (and still necessitates) setting up Lepton aka Firefox-UI-Fix. There\u2019s plenty more things people are grumpy about\u2014abandoning Servo, Solo (yet more AI hype), Pocket\u2026 there\u2019s so many things, one begins to lose track.\n\nYou can totally still stick with Firefox\u2026 but remember to download userChrome.css from GitHub. And if you want vertical tabs, be sure to install Sidebery until Mozilla get around to implementing native vertical tabs. (You know, like Chromium-based browsers including Edge and Vivaldi already have.)\n\nAnd then turn off a bunch of settings and install a bunch of extensions to tighten up privacy.\n\nAnd then brace yourself for Mozilla to find new and exciting ways to disappoint you every six weeks with some new brand of nonsensical bullshit.\n\nWhen the Privacy Preserving Ads stuff was rolled out, I pulled the trigger and switched to LibreWolf. The AI chat stuff has prompted a lot of people to look for Firefox but with less Mozilla nonsense.\n\nSwitching to what are essentially \u201cFirefox distros\u201d to collectively try and nudge Mozilla back to making more sensible decisions instead of AI hype chasing is an eminently reasonable one. There\u2019s more reasons than just that. Part of the reason I use Firefox-based browsers rather than Chromium browsers is because I want to preserve some choice and diversity in browser engines. The existence of a choice of different Firefox derived browsers may allow space for experimentation in designing better browsers. In Chromium land, Arc has shown that there\u2019s an opportunity for quite radically rethinking how browsers work. Same for Orion in Mac/iOS-land.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a detailed review of the different browsers, just a few comments and observations having tried them.\n\nLibreWolf\n\nLibreWolf has been my daily driver for a few months now. It\u2019s very close to Firefox, but with a bunch of privacy-focussed defaults.\n\nSome of these are straightforward: uBlock Origin is pre-installed, for instance. Google is not set as a default search engine\u2014DuckDuckGo, Qwant, Mojeek, and a public SearXNG instance are. HTTPS only is on by default. There\u2019s no sponsored content on the home page, and there\u2019s no telemetry.\n\nLibreWolf\u2019s commitment to good privacy defaults is simultaneously a feature and a problem. The \u201cresist fingerprinting\u201d (RFP) settings which are pulled in from the Tor Browser actively make using certain websites impossible. They trigger some kind of anti-abuse mechanisms on said websites which then require that I complete a CAPTCHA, and there is only so much of my life I wish to spend clicking squares containing fire hydrants, \u201ccrosswalks\u201d, or yellow New York taxis or various other bits of American street furniture. If it were just on crappy websites, I wouldn\u2019t mind but the main place I encounter this is actually JSTOR, along with a number of other academic/research databases. Hindering access to the few websites where the content is written by subject matter experts rather than AI-generated marketing slop is inconvenient enough that I turned RFP off via a trip to about:config .\n\nWhat I\u2019d really like is if RFP could be turned off on a per-site basis. Or if one could use the containers feature in Firefox (perhaps with Multi-Account Containers) to have RFP running on most sites, with special treatment for the websites that don\u2019t like it.\n\nSimilarly, not storing history is a great privacy choice. It\u2019s also an incredibly annoying choice for the average user who would quite like to be able to find that blog post they spent hours searching for again in their browser\u2019s history section. And, yes, you can turn it off.\n\nIf you are the sort of person who has a YubiKey, has attended a GPG key signing party, or has opinions about elliptic curve cryptography, LibreWolf may be a great fit for your tastes. If you\u2019re not, beware that security and usability are destined to have a rocky relationship\u2014and you may have to go fumbling around to disable certain security features if certain websites get aggrieved at the hardened privacy choices in LibreWolf.\n\nFloorp\n\nFloorp is a Firefox-based browser built by Ablaze, \u201ca group of creators primarily active in Japan. It is a community and not a company or a public organization\u201d (according to their FAQ).\n\nWhen you start, you can choose a \u201ctemplate\u201d. The UI doesn\u2019t really tell you what the templates are, but if you push the buttons, it\u2019ll show you.\n\nThe \u201cdefault\u201d options gives you an Vivaldi/Edge style sidebar containing icons that open up sidebar tabs for bookmarks, history and a \u2018notes\u2019 feature, plus links to documentation, Google Translate (I\u2019m home the Firefox local translation will come at some point), and passwords, settings and extensions. In addition, there\u2019s a sidebar panel called the \u201cbrowser manager\u201d which is history, downloads, tags and bookmarks rolled into one. It has a menu bar at the top. Presumably, on Windows and Linux, this is the primary way to access the menu bar, but this is probably a bug that needs fixing on the Mac version.\n\nThe \u201cbasic\u201d template disables this sidebar. The \u201cadvanced\u201d template enables a status bar that contains a \u201cfull screen\u201d button and a \u201ctake a screenshot\u201d button, and not much else, though you can obviously put stuff on there. The \u201cdefault\u201d option is fine. You can remove items from the sidebar, but annoyingly. It\u2019d be nice if you could move extension icons there, but that\u2019s a limitation of Firefox.\n\nIn addition, Floorp allows you to choose from a variety of different Firefox UI designs including both Proton and Photon/Lepton. It has built-in vertical tabs, without the fuss (but also without the features) of Sidebery. If you\u2019re intending to use vertical tabs, the Proton UI actually fits in aesthetically in both light and dark themes in a way it doesn\u2019t in Firefox.\n\nThe sensible privacy defaults of LibreWolf aren\u2019t there, so you\u2019ll probably want to install uBlock Origin, change from Google to a search engine that doesn\u2019t use text regurgitation software to advise users to \u201cenjoy the crunchy texture of glass without worrying about it contributing to weight gain\u201d, relax in a bath with a toaster and all the other stuff to turn the web from an absolute wreck into almost usable.\n\nOne feature I do like a lot in both Floorp and Zen: workspaces. These are very similar to both Arc\u2019s profiles and spaces features, and \u201ctab groups\u201d in Safari and Orion, and are handy for separating out personal and work-related tabs, or dealing with the general irritation caused by having multiple logins for different Single Sign On (another tech industry lie).\n\nDetails on the website are a bit sparse, and quite a lot of the Japanese documentation hasn\u2019t been translated into English. It\u2019s decent though, and offers lots of customisability.\n\nZen\n\nZen is relatively new. The design is clearly very inspired by Arc (rounded corners galore). Vertical tabs by default (plans are afoot to add boring old-style tabs).\n\nThere\u2019s lots to say about the layout. There\u2019s a compact mode which makes everything slide away.\n\nLike Floorp, there\u2019s a sidebar feature. Given the tab bar is a sidebar, to distinguish it from the tab bar, the settings refer to it as \u201cWeb Side Panels\u201d\u2014while the UI calls it the \u201cZen Sidebar\u201d. It\u2019s like a browser-in-a-browser. It comes preloaded with links for Wikipedia, Twitter/X, YouTube, Google Translate and Todoist. I can see the use cases for all of them: quickly looking stuff up on the side in Wikipedia, tweeting (excreting?), watching videos, translating snippets of text, and marking off items on your to-do list\u2026 but there doesn\u2019t seem to be the kind of coherence there as there is with using the sidebar to put browser features like bookmarks, history etc. I disabled the Web Side Panels/Zen Sidebar it in the settings as I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll use it.\n\nSomewhat confusingly, in Keyboard Shortcuts, I can set shortcuts to open history and bookmarks in a traditional Firefox-style sidebar. And I can open these from the View menu. In the tab sidebar, there are buttons for opening the history and bookmarks. The bookmarks button opens the bookmarks in a sidebar, while the history opens up the equivalent of the recently closed tabs section.\n\nIf you really like sidebars, you could have a sidebar with your tabs, then click \u2018bookmarks\u2019 to open a bookmarks sidebar, then have a \u201cZen Sidebar\u201d (aka a Web Side Panel). But you probably shouldn\u2019t.\n\nOne small nitpick I did find\u2014the icons for opening the bookmarks and history or sliding the tab sidebar over don\u2019t have tooltips. The settings button has a tooltip which reads \u201cOpen settings ({$shortcut})\u201d which presumably should contain a keyboard shortcut.\n\nOn macOS, another weird part\u2014if you use a tab sidebar, the red/yellow/green buttons are no longer in the corner\u2014they\u2019re immediately above the content area. This looks a bit odd. It\u2019s probably remediable by having the tab bar on the right\u2026 but the checkbox to move it to the right doesn\u2019t work for me. You can fix it by switching on \u201cUse legacy toolbar position\u201d, or by enabling the title bar in the toolbar customisation menu.\n\nOne other slight annoyance: when I tried to log on to a site supporting Passkeys, it stated \u201cThis browser or device is reporting partial passkey support.\u201d\n\nThe above complaints may sound like I dislike Zen\u2014I very much don\u2019t. It\u2019s described as \u201calpha\u201d on their website and release notes, and it\u2019s remarkably good given the first alpha release came out less than two months ago, so this kind of UI nitpicks will almost certainly go away given how much progress they\u2019re making in a very short time.\n\nThey\u2019ve made a theme store to collect themes specifically for Zen, which is helpful given the significant distance it has travelled from stock Firefox in terms of UI design.\n\nLike Floorp, there\u2019s workspaces, which are very handy and integrate with containers. Also like Floop (but unlike LibreWolf out-of-the-box), you can use Firefox Sync.\n\nThe default search engine is DuckDuckGo, which is an improvement on Google. There\u2019s also Google, (English) Wikipedia and eBay.\n\nAgain, the privacy defaults are pretty much like Firefox\u2019s, so you\u2019ll want to install uBlock Origin and any other privacy-related add-ons that you would in Firefox.\n\nOnwards\n\nThere are a bunch of other Firefox-derived browsers like Waterfox, Pale Moon, Basilisk, IceCat. I haven\u2019t tried them, and don\u2019t know much about them.\n\nOne important thing to keep an eye on how quickly security fixes get pushed through from upstream Firefox to Firefox-derived browsers. For a long time, I stuck with Firefox precisely because of this. It\u2019s a sign of how bad the rot has got at Mozilla that people are so keen on alternatives. I really hope Mozilla might learn something from this, but history suggests they\u2019ll try literally anything else first, and the love-hate relationship will never end.", "label": "personal"}

{"title": "Keeping current in infosec", "url": "https://shellsharks.com/notes/2023/11/06/keeping-current-in-infosec", "content": "Mike Sass\n\n@shellsharks\n\nI do a lot of reading related to my infosec career, whether it be in-depth reading/research/analysis or just briefly skimming articles/social media posts. For what I do, staying on top of what is happening in the industry is very important. Couple that with an admittedly debilitating mild social media / phone addiction and you get a very routine course of daily reading. Below I will explain my daily routine for keeping up with cybersecurity news, research and more!\n\nDaily Infosec Reading Routine\n\nComplete Checks\n\nThe items below represent feeds I fully check daily, and in many cases, multiple-times/throughout-the day. I\u2019ve also listed them in the order I typically check them.\n\nThings I Check Sparingly\n\nBelow I\u2019ve listed feeds/platforms I check either as overflow from my primary reading or only once-in-a-while, either because the signal-to-noise ratio isn\u2019t great or the feed is algorithmic, i.e. no way to \u201cread all of it\u201d.\n\nThreads : Threads is a lively place but the infosec content there is very limited at this time.\n\n: Threads is a lively place but the infosec content there is very limited at this time.

BlueSky : A small infosec contingent here but nothing compared to Mastodon.\n\n: A small infosec contingent here but nothing compared to Mastodon. Discord: There are a lot of infosec-related servers, but looking through all the different servers and their respective channels for interesting discussions/links is too time-consuming of a task. I don\u2019t even have enough time most days to look at the Shellsharks Discord server.\n\nPodcasts\n\nThough not technically \u201creading\u201d, I also have a couple infosec-related podcasts I tune in to when new episodes become available.\n\nWhen I find interesting articles, I save them to my read-it-later service (which is currently Pocket - though I plan on migrating to something else soon). When I have time, I go back into my saved items and open articles to peruse/digest.\n\nIn addition to browsing and reading articles, I also find time to share interesting articles out (via Mastodon, Threads, Discord or Lemmy) and have discussions about them if/when people engage.\n\nI will admit I am probably on the more extreme end of \u201ckeeping up with\u201d security news/trends and you certainly don\u2019t need to go to these lengths to stay fresh. But now you know what I do so feel free to copy some or all of it and get out there and learn!", "label": "personal"}

Made a ton of changes to the site. The home page now features a mixed feed of all of my posts, notes, logs and other content types. I\u2019ve also started a link blog to share cool links I come across. Finally, I\u2019ve figured out how to paginate a TON of stuff, to make some of my pages more performant (my Activity page is one good example of how pagination is making that page usable on mobile now).\n\nWith respect to my home page, I used to be kinda precious about only exposing my formal \u201cblog posts\u201d, which are supposed to be longer-form, and in some undefinable way, \u201cbetter\u201d than other things I write and publish on the site. Inspired by others in the Indieweb community, who proudly feature everything they write, I decided to try out the same. To distinguish between different content types, i\u2019ve added a splash of color with icons corresponding to different post types. I also hope it can call attention (for those who are interested) to all the other things I publish. For so long, I had these hidden away in pages you could find via my \u201chamburger\u201d menu, but you had to go exploring to really find most of it. And given the number of things I link to in that menu, I doubt many people had the patience or interest to really hunt down other things. So, here we are!\n\nLet me know what ya think! I\u2019m still tinkering around with the format, theme and other general aesthetics of the site and various pages, but I like it well enough at this point.", "label": "personal"}

{"title": "5 years", "url": "https://shellsharks.com/notes/2024/05/30/5-years", "content": "Mike Sass\n\n@shellsharks\n\nOn May 30, 2019 I published the very first post to shellsharks.com, \u201cGetting Into Information Security\u201d. When I first started the blog I didn\u2019t have a particularly clear idea of what I wanted to do with it, but I had the idea to write that piece and one other idea which which was to catalog all named vulnerabilities. Beyond that, I just wrote about whatever came to mind. It\u2019s been 5 years to the day since I got that first piece out and not only has the site come a long way, but so have I.\n\nIn the beginning, I think my main focus was to keep the site mostly infosec-related in terms of my writing, but even back then I left the door open to write about other things. Afterall, the tagline for my site has always been \u201cInfosec, Technology, Life\u201d. The first 4 years of the site did end up skewing mostly Infosec / Tech but since discovering the IndieWeb last year, I have made a noticeable shift towards writing more about \u201cLife\u201d, i.e. anything non-tech / non-infosec, and it\u2019s been a lot of fun!\n\nThe site has also gone through a number of big aesthetic overhauls and architectural redesigns. There will always be new things I want to add to the site or ways in which I wish I could rearchitect it even further, but for now, I am quite happy with the latest generation of its look-and-feel as well as the functionality itself.\n\nI\u2019ve not maintained the same level of active-ness throughout the last 5 years, but in more recent history I\u2019m quite pleased with the amount of attention I\u2019ve given it, the upgrades I\u2019ve made, and the writing I\u2019ve produced, and I am certainly starting the next 5 years quite strong. I plan to continue to funnel my professional work, technological side quests and life experiences into what I write about.\n\nI really want to thank everyone who has read anything I\u2019ve written, those who have offered kind words over social media or elsewhere, those who have given me meaningful/constructive feedback and anyone who has taken the time to subscribe, like or engage with me or my writing. Like many who start a blog, I had no expectation of building a readership. I started it with the intention of sharing my oft-repeated guidance on getting into the infosec field and as a place to write resources for myself. Over time though I have found that sure enough, there are people out there who enjoy, or get value out of what I have documented or what I have to say and it is undoubtedly a good feeling.\n\nThese days, I spend as much if not more effort writing about and encouraging others to start a site and be themselves as I do writing about tech/infosec. My experience with shellsharks has taught me more about what it means to be authentic on the web than it has helped me with my various infosec-related research things. I\u2019m still a cybersecurity professional and as such will continue to make that a focus of what I learn and thus what I write about, but it is clear to me that I\u2019ve developed a passion for IndieWeb advocacy and I hope to continue to inspire others both in my field and abroad to start their own journey in the personal web.\n\nThanks for reading.

Drop me a note, or comment at the end, if you participate and I will add a link at the bottom of this page. Use the tag #Pointless10 if you're on the socials.\n\nDo you floss your teeth? No! Pointless. A good brush is enough. Tea, coffee, or water? Between the three, water - preferable still and ice-cold. I dabble in tea -- maybe one cup every other day. I've never had a coffee. I know, I'm odd. Did anyone ask about wine? ;-) Bare feet as much as possible, around the house mostly. Outdoors, generally a canvas shoe (Sketchers) . I don't have any sneakers. Favourite dessert? Lime Cheesecake. Not the American baked kind, but the set one. The first thing you do when you wake up? Check my phone (don't we all) then shower. Age you'd like to stick to? 26 seems a good age to be for body health, but I want to retain all the wisdom I've gained at 55. How many hats do you own? Three. All brimmed style hats, no caps. I love wearing a hat but don't do it enough. Describe the last photo you took A bottle of red wine I tried at a friend's house; didn't want to forget what it was. Worst TV show Any soap opera. Although they are a work of fiction, people seem to believe that's how we should live real life... As rude, disrespectful, argumentative twats. As a child, what was your aspiration for adulthood? To become a vet. Didn't happen.

{"title": "Travel Adventures", "url": "https://shellsharks.com/blog-challenge-travel-adventures", "content": "A Blog Questions Challenge\n\nHere\u2019s another Blog Questions Challenge. This week, it\u2019s all about Travel Adventures!\n\nHere are the questions\u2026\n\nSilliest Souvenir\n\nIn 2014 me and my wife went to Costa Rica. We did a lot of travel-by-bus to various excusions and destinations across the country. During those bus rides, I (for whatever reason) witnessed an unusual amount of machete-based chopping of vegetation and general plant-related growth on the sides of the rural roads we traveled down. Now this might not be unusual for Costa Rica, but it was for me as a tourist. So naturally, I wanted to get a machete as a souvenir. At the time of purchasing it, I never considered what it would look like, trying to get a huge machete back through customs at the airport\u2026\n\nState-side, we got to security and that\u2019s when I remembered my cargo. Sure enough, going through security I was asked to come with them to a back room as they had some questions for me. I thought for sure it was because of the machete. But nope! They were interested in a different souvenir of mine. We had also purchased a \u201crain stick\u201d, which is effectively just a hollow wooden tube filled with small beads. They were really curious (and slightly concerend) about what all those little beads were inside the stick. After a brief explanation though they were satisfied and I was on my way once more. Not even a single mention of the machete. Hah!\n\nTeleport for a Day Trip\n\nThat\u2019s me in Bora Bora circa 2016. There\u2019s a very non-zero chance that I was thinking about climbing that mountain in this exact moment (in addition to just posing for a super-cool sunset pic). If I could teleport to one place for a day to do something, it wound be here, to hike Bora Bora\u2019s Mount Otemanu. Afterwards, I\u2019d just chill on the beach with a nice beverage and watch the sun set, much like I did in 2016. \ud83c\udfdd\ufe0f \ud83c\udf05\n\nWeirdest Food\n\nIn 2013, I went on my first international trip ever. So where does one go on their first trip out of the country? Africa of course! Me and my wife went to South Africa\u2014first to Cape Town and then to Kruger National Park for some safari-ing. To this day (and I\u2019ve done a fair bit of travel since), I would still say it\u2019s my favorite trip I\u2019ve ever done. One night, while dining out in the city-center of Cape Town, we ordered what I remember as some sort of \u201cexotic meat sampler\u201d. On the resulting plate, we tried a number of interesting South African-native game including Kudu, Crocodile, Springbok and if I\u2019m remembering fully, Zebra. All I really remember about that experience beyond what I tried was that Kudu was delicious, and I was not into the croc.\n\nMemorable Wrong Turn\n\nLook, my wife is the (trip) planner of the two of us, and she is amazing at it. What this means is that our trips are always fantastic, we get into a TON of fun activities, and we rarely encounter anything you might consider a \u201cwrong turn\u201d. That said, this particlar question made me think of two distinct wrong-turn-esque events\u2026\n\nOnce, while driving somewhere in Germany we witnessed this little car in front of us try to make too sharp of a turn on a highway on-ramp and completely spin out\u2014like a 360\u00b0 spin. It was wild, and quite scary to witness. A \u201cwrong turn\u201d for that individual to say the least.\n\nThe most memorable \u201cwrong turn\u201d for me however occurred when me and my wife were trying to drive back from the national park in Sintra, Portugal to where we were staying in Lisbon. We exited the park into what I imagine was the old-town part of Sintra and ended up on some very tiny streets with extremely narrow passage ways between the buildings and walls of the town. At one point, my wife had to get out of the car and help me narrowly traverse one particularly tight corridor. Our rental was a pretty small car too. Luckily, we made it out without a scratch, literally!\n\nThanks for reading!", "label": "personal"}

(In no particular order)\n\n\n\nHad I known these, and carefully considered each, I would have saved myself A LOT of time fixing stuff, and even now, would have a lot less things to fix and add. For example, my CSS files are a mess, I have a lot of poorly managed inline .JS everywhere, accessiblity nightmares abound and much more\u2026 Learn from my mistakes!\n\nUnderstand and properly leverage Semantic HTML Elements. This approach will help your code be more readable, more modular and more descriptive.\n\nBe purposeful and methodical with your CSS \u201ccode\u201d. Try to define common sense CSS and make it reusable. To the best of your ability, try to avoid overusing inline CSS. It will make things harder to troubleshoot and more annoying to maintain over time. Take the time to understand dynamic HTMl stuff for different screen-sized devices, etc\u2026 You\u2019re going to want your site to look good on desktops and phones, simple as that.\n\nUse JavaScript sparingly, try to design your site to work well-enough for those who completely disable JavaScript. Look, my site has plenty of JS, and I know certain things would completely break if it were disabled (looking at you hamburger menu). That\u2019s really too bad for folks who want to use my site. I\u2019d like to fix this, but just haven\u2019t had time to figure it out. Also consider The JavaScript Trap. JS not only has incompatibility issues, but can also just slow down your site and introduce potential security vulns. Important things to consider!\n\nDon\u2019t box yourself in creatively\u2014 REALLY! Allow yourself to write about whatever you want. Use things like collections, different post types or tags to logically differentiate things you think are meant for different audiences if you must.\n\nVersion one of your site should have a theme toggle (i.e. dark/light mode) and a search function. You\u2019re going to want these eventually, and it\u2019s worth getting them right in the initial design if you ask me.\n\nBuild accessibility in from the get-go. I\u2019ve put very little effort into this, and that sucks. One of my Guiding Principles for this site is that it is available to be consumed by all. Yet, if I\u2019ve not made it adequately accessible, it will never meet this mantra. It\u2019s not necessarily hard to do, but if you don\u2019t consider it from t=0, it becomes harder and more time-consuming to retroactively make it so.\n\nWrite for yourself, not for some perceived \u201caudience\u201d. Don\u2019t try to be a persona (i.e. some \u201cprofessional\u201d fragment of your true self)\u2014just be yourself.\n\nDo some basic website wireframing as part of your initial size build. Carefully consider what you want your home page to look like, how you want people to navigate about, what you want your posts to look like, etc\u2026\n\nHow \u201csocial\u201d do you want your site to be? In the age of the social web, there is a lot you can add or implement to make your site interoperate with ActivityPub, IndieWeb protocols, comment systems, etc\u2026", "label": "personal"}

It\u2019s delicious! I normally take 2/3 of a pint glass with a splash of half-n-half, another splash of 2% milk, then top it off with ice (cubes). This is what I drink most of the time these days. Since I\u2019m newish to brewing my own cold brew, I\u2019m still exploring what types of beans I like most and have really been enjoying sampling different roasts and regions (speaking of, maybe I should start a sort of \u201ccoffeelog\u201d where I can do some tasting notes / reviews\u2026 \ud83e\udd14). Not sure what I like the most yet, but I do know that it\u2019s far better than the french press swill I had been making before.\n\nWhen I\u2019m out \u2018n about and ordering coffee, I typically go with an iced latte or sometimes just an iced coffee. I like getting the latte\u2019s because I can\u2019t make them at home. I never drink hot coffee. I\u2019d rather have no coffee than have it hot. I just don\u2019t enjoy hot beverages. When I do happen across a Starbucks, my go-to order is their Iced Brown Sugar Oatmilk Shaken Espresso, with just 1 pump of the syrup, otherwise it\u2019s too sweet for my liking.\n\nCheers!", "label": "personal"}

It's pretty good; I'd recommend it.\n\nCan't go wrong with Orson Scott Card!! One of my fav sci-fi authors, I never tried audiobooks, I think this is going to be my first.\n\nThe Ender's series/branch/tree? is pretty vast, but I really enjoyed Ender's game, and Ender's Shadow.\n\nI really liked the one with the piggies. Whatever one that is.\n\nSpeaker for the dead, the sequel to Ender's game.\n\nI thought it was good also.\n\nGreat book! Love it!\n\nIt is one of the best read audiobooks that I've ever listened too.

Very inspiring.\n\nby Tara Westover: Born to survivalists in the mountains, she lived off the grid for the first 17 years of her life. She then began to educate herself, learned enough math and grammar to get accepted by an university. She then travel the world and goes on an adventure that changes her life.

The book has lots of simple details that add so much color to her world.\n\nEducated sounds like an interesting read. I'd check it out.\n\nI got it from Bill Gates yearly reading list. You're hardly wrong with that list. Enjoy!\n\nI'm reading \"Where the Crawdad Sings\" and \"The Power of Habit\" right now (I have one Audible and one paper book going at a time). I also keep a thread on twitter with stuff I've currently read with mini-reviews!\n\nI couldn't put \"Where the Crawdad Sings\" down!\n\nThe\n\nseries by Ada Palmer. A series of four books with two currently released. I'm reading the third right now and like it quite much.

I'm always happy to answer additional questions :)\n\nI just finished reading\n\nby Mary Robinette Kowal. It's a sci fi fiction of an alternate universe where a meteorite hits the Earth (Washington, DC specifically) and causes huge climate changes that will make the Earth inhabitable in a few years. The only solution? Colonizing space!\n\nThe book features a lot of well-written and brilliant female pilots, computers, physicists and astronauts.\n\nThis book is soooo good. I loved it.\n\nIt was great \ud83d\ude04 did you get a chance to read its sequel?\n\nNo, it sounded interesting, but I like the book so much stand alone, I don't want to know what happens next.\n\nBut it ended with such a cliffhanger! \ud83d\ude32\n\nAs far as I know the second book is out and the third one will be out in 2020. So I'll wait until then to read the two back-to-back.\n\nBeen in a bit of a crabby mood toward the \"traditional\" workplace lately, so I've circled back to three of my standbys:\n\nAnd since my doctor recently gave me a hard time about my carb'tastic eating habits and sedentary desk job, I'll probably pick up one more title for motivation:\n\nListening to\n\nby Richard Feynman\n\nand reading\n\nby Keith Edmunds\n\nI'm studying-up to be a D&D Dungeon Master for a new campaign I'm doing with my coworkers, and am reading through the\n\nand the\n\n.\n\nI've the Guide too!

So, as you can imagine, I read a\n\nof books, both with my mother and on my own. (I read through the complete unabridged Wizard of Oz series by myself in one summer when I was six.)\n\nI joined my first professional critique group when I was eight; I was told I'd be welcome to join, but they'd expect me to accept the same unvarnished feedback that any grown-up member would get, and to read their work and provide the same sort of honest feedback. So, I did.\n\nWhen writing professionally, you really learn that nothing you write is sacred. Even the sentence you think is the\n\nbrilliant, or the quote you think must surely be worthy of Bartlett's Quotations, might actually need to get cut from the book. Most people are okay coming up with words; the art of writing is largely in\n\nof words.\n\nFrom there, I just kept writing, participating in critique groups and countless writing workshops, and honing my craft.\n\nCongrats!!\n\nI am proud of creating JSitor, which is an alternative of JSFiddle, JSBin and CodePen.\n\nI won't say that JSitor will be the best tool but definitely it is worth to explore. Give a try and share your feedback. I would love to hear from you guys.\n\nAwesome work!\n\nI'm finding it an easier interface than codepen, and the autocomplete is great.\n\nThank you Willsmart.

Even though there are not so much stars, last year it registered 7K NPM downloads, and this year, at this time it reaches +35K NPM downloads \ud83d\ude0a.\n\nIn many fields of mathematics, morphism refers to a structure-preserving map from one mathematical structure to another. A morphism\n\nwith source\n\nand target\n\nis written\n\n. Thus a morphism is represented by an arrow from its\n\nto its\n\n.\n\nOn one of my project, I had to create almost the same thing!

I've had scoliosis and kyphosis, and I was a year or two away from needing surgery to fix it.\n\nMy girlfriend motivated me to get a personal trainer specialized in posture, and after 7 months of regular exercises and progress tracking, I'm almost finished in fixing my posture. Exercises were simple and very effective and I didn't need to buy anything to perform them. And I also could do them at home. Each month I would get a new set of exercises targeting different areas of the body that were needed to correct the posture.\n\nSo I also want to encourage anyone else that has issues with posture to seek help and try to fix it before it gets worse. Posture exercises are great and you'll feel much better after a month or two of regular exercises.\n\nI started my\n\n24 days ago and wrote on 23 days, with only one failed day and no safety-net.\n\nI've done a blogging challenge as well!

I live with just my dog, I don't have children, I've been working remote for the last year and a half, and I've been single for most of my time doing side-work. I also am at a place in my career where putting in a 40 hour workweek most weeks at my day job is sufficient. It's a huge privilege that I'm able to be in the position that I am, and I know that my life will shift a lot in the future.\n\nEarly in my career, I worked a lot more than I do now -- I don't even want to do the math on how much, but it was a lot. I didn't have much balance in my life, and I let my social media-life consume me. I wanted to do it all, which wasn't possible. I ended up getting super burnt out, anxious, and unable to be as productive as I wanted to be. Balance is\n\nimportant. I can't overstate that enough. If you're dealing with burnout,\n\nwas a super helpful read to see how bad burnout can really become and how to be more balanced.\n\nI highly prioritize time with friends and family, runs with my dog, reading non-work related books, and being a total foodie in addition to my day job and the company I run. I am more than my work, and I don't want to lose my other identities.\n\nHere are some things that I've learned that help me be my most productive. This will look different for everybody, but I hope some of this is helpful.\n\nFirst off, take care of yourself. Sleeping the optimal amount for you will make you more alert and focused throughout the day. The same thing is true for drinking enough water. I also try to eat protein, fat, and carb balanced meals frequently throughout the day. I run most days and try to do other strength-based workouts too. Plus, I take a spa night on Sundays where I do face and hair masks and teeth whitening.\n\nDon't take health advice from me -- it's not what I do. Still, I do think prioritizing your health is one of the most important things you can do for your productivity and overall well-being.\n\nAs far as scheduling goes, I live by my Google Calendars. I put everything on there - I'm the person that sends my friends GCal invites for every hangout session. Otherwise, I'll forget. It's as simple as that.\n\nI have three calendars, one for my personal life, one for We Learn Code (my company), and one for my day job. Sometimes, I'll forward events to my personal calendar, so they're all in one place. If I'm super overwhelmed, I'll calendar block everything. So, I will have every minute of my day, even free time scheduled in. I don't do this often now, but it used to be really helpful for me to see my schedule upfront.\n\nNote: this was a week where I was in between jobs and had a lot I wanted to get done. I was also on vacation for the second half of the week.\n\nIn order to prioritize what I am going to work on, I first ask myself if it's something I'm passionate about. If it is, then I think about the time commitment and what I\n\nbe able to do if I decided to take on the new task. So, if I were to pick up a new freelance client, I would have to postpone working on an ebook, for example.\n\nMy greater goals and priorities have shifted over time. I initially wanted to build a bigger audience, and the activities I took on were correlated to that. Now, my financial situation has changed a bit, and I rely on my side-work being a larger portion of my income. In the future, I may prioritize more free time, which will change things again!\n\nTo help me prioritize, I use\n\nto track my time spent on every project I do -- not just paid ones. I'm even timing myself writing this post right now. I do this so that I can see where my time goes, which inefficiencies exist, and the payoff of each activity.\n\nFor example, here's my Toggl report for the week I'm writing this. Each of my projects is color-coded, and different views show my hours worked per day and listings of each activity by time.\n\nI also ask myself, \"What are the three most important things for me to get done?\". For my side work, I have three big to-do items for the week. For my day job, I do three per day. I use a pinned Google Keep sticky to keep track of these things, and I have another sticky with any time-sensitive tasks I need to do that day. Mostly things that won't take long, but need to get done then and there. Having just a few essential things to work on helps me to stay focused. I try to only work on what I've set out to do at the beginning of the week. I'm pretty dedicated to getting these few tasks done and worry a lot less about everything else.\n\nI read the book\n\nrecently. It got pretty repetitive at some points, but it does a great job at explaining how to prioritize and why prioritization matters so much. Just do what's essential, nothing more nothing less.\n\nAlso, I do not do it all myself. If there's something that makes sense for me to have someone else do, I will hire a service to handle those tasks. I do wash and fold for my laundry, I used to hire a cleaning service for my apartment, and a large portion of my diet is take-out. I'm in a privileged position to be able to outsource some of these pieces of my life, but it allows me to do more of the work that fires me up: teaching code.\n\nMotivation is also a challenging piece of doing side work, and I'm so imperfect at always being motivated. I give myself lots of breaks, and I remind myself that this I'm choosing to do. I do have some advice for getting and staying motivated.\n\nFirst, I love having groups of friends that I \"mastermind\" with. We inspire each other with our work, commiserate over the hard parts, and discuss strategies for growth. I love working with other people, and working on projects with other people or at least talking to them about those projects is a huge source of motivation for me.\n\nI also utilize the two-minute rule -- if something takes two minutes or less, I just have to get it done. Having one thing crossed off of my to-do list starts the ball rolling, and I usually get more done.\n\nSometimes, I set a timer and timebox how long I'll spend on something -- \"I don't feel like writing right now, but if I spend five minutes on it, I'll be closer to where I want to be.\" I rarely want to stop at the end of those five minutes, but it's a great trick for getting me started on something.\n\nI also am really motivated by finishing things -- leaving them half-done really bothers me. So I usually break tasks into smaller and smaller sub-tasks and focus on completing sub-tasks. This makes me feel more accomplished and like I'm making progress, so I'll be much less likely to abandon the project.\n\nOne of the most difficult things to handle when my social media following grew was the non-stop messages. From people requesting advice to spam to lovely comments about my work, I was all the sudden getting hundreds of communications a day. I receive, on average, 100 mentions on Twitter a day, 15-20 Twitter direct messages, and 50-70 emails. It's a lot.\n\nAt first, I would respond to everything. With a lot of thought and care -- essentially writing personalized blog posts for anyone who asked me a question. It wasn't scalable. I still feel some guilt, but I don't respond to everything anymore. I have so much content that's open to the public, which scales so much better than offering 1:1 advice. I also mute my own tweets after a little while if they get a lot of attention, and I have filters so I don't get any notifications from social media. I do, however, have Tweetdeck set up to show me all mentions and quote tweets so that I can quickly mass respond to people.\n\nI also have a system for my emails. I have three folders in my inboxes: today, this week, and this month. When an email comes in, I delete it or put it in one of these folders. I respond to\n\nemails every weekday,\n\nemails on Mondays, and\n\nemails at the end of the month. I also add emails that will take some time to my to-do list so that I can allot that time better. I'm also really interested in implementing\n\nemail system down the road. It seems awesome, it just takes some time to get used to.\n\nI take notes on\n\n. I take short-term notes that I won't keep forever in\n\n. Then I can archive stickies when I'm done with them. If they're something I want long term, I take notes in markdown and upload them to GitHub. I take notes during meetings I'm in, on books I read, on courses I take, etc. It's good for learning, and it gives me a synthesized version of the material to come back to.\n\nIf I have an idea for a project or a blog post, I write that thought down, otherwise, I'll forget it. I even have a notebook next to my bed for this reason!\n\nRelated to notes, I also have checklists for everything I do -- for blog posts before I publish, for recording Egghead videos, for my morning and evening routines, etc. Making a checklist makes it so I don't have to think, I can refer to the list. I am not very detail-oriented, so having the steps for something written out is so helpful, so I don't forget anything.\n\nMy morning and evening routines are all written in large text on a\n\non my fridge -- even just brushing my teeth is on there! I have my weekly workout schedule and chores list on there too.\n\nFor large projects, I usually use Trello to stay organized and motivated. I'll have checklists for each sub-task on each card. Breaking an enormous task into smaller ones helps me keep motivated and feel like I'm making progress.\n\nI've heard great things about\n\n, a book all about keeping checklists for everything. I haven't read the full text, but reading a summary of it inspired me to start creating these checklists.\n\nIf I can convince you to do one thing after reading this article, it would be to pick up\n\n. This book changed so much for me. Instead of focusing on goals, I try and focus on building up habits that make me who I want to become.\n\nI use\n\nhabit-tracker to keep track of habits I'm trying to build. Some things I have on there include: reading a chapter of a career-focused book each day, drinking enough water, and cleaning my apartment for at least 5 minutes. There's the immediate reward of having the habit change colors after it's completed, and there's an incentive to keep the habit chain going!\n\nAs far as file management goes, I keep everything on Google Drive. That way, if my laptop dies or something, I'll still have a backup. I also only keep files I'm using frequently on my computer to keep that organized. I have folders for projects and for life stuff! I also try to keep my personal and We Learn Code drives separate. Gotta keep work/side-hustle/life balance!\n\nI also keep my browser bookmarks super organized in folders. I only keep things I need, otherwise, I'll save links elsewhere -- like Pinterest or in my notes about something. Bookmarks are for links I frequently come back to. I also have a\n\nfolder filled with articles that I want to read. I try to allocate some time to get through these from time to time too!\n\nI think the term work-life balance is imperfect, but I work to make sure that I'm not working all the time. I'm someone who very much has a tendency to work a huge number of hours and to abandon other aspects of my life and health to do more work. This isn't good, and I actively work to not do this, especially since I have been much more prone to burnout recently.\n\nFirst of all, I don't have work email or Slack on my phone. I only have them on my work computer, which I don't touch outside of work hours.\n\nI also try to make my bedroom a technology-free zone. I will say this is\n\neasier when I'm not working from home -- quarantine has made this pretty much impossible. But, I find I sleep so much better if I put my phone and my computer in my living room before I sleep. I also think having dedicated workspaces when you do work from home is so helpful, and it's something I wish that I could more fully implement in my own life (darn city rent prices!).\n\nI am someone who works best without interruption and with long blocks of time. I don't do well with random 15-minute slots to work, rather I'd prefer to have one long afternoon to work. I used to do all of my blogging from the same restaurant in DC, Busboys and Poets. I'd go there every Sunday afternoon and crank out a post. Having that routine and that long block of time was perfect for me.\n\nI also work best in the afternoon as compared to mornings or nights, though in college, late nights were my everything. I usually do side work immediately after my normal workday ends and on weekend afternoons. Everyone is going to be so different with this -- experiment and find times that work best for you!\n\nI know that the\n\ntechnique works really well for some people, but I work best in long focused blocks. I tend to follow the\n\ninstead. I take breaks when I need to or when I finish a task, but frequent breaks aren't helpful for me, nor do I need them.\n\nSometimes, I have a tendency to get distracted. Especially by social media and the internet more generally. During times like that, I'll use the\n\napp to avoid distracting sites. Sometimes I'll even shut off the internet in my apartment if I really want to get some writing done.\n\nOne additional productivity system I find super helpful is batching. Batching is when you do a bunch of similar activities at once. So, for example, when I did Instagram I would write all my captions for the month at one time, and I'd pre-create graphics and find images. Or when I'm filming videos, I'll do multiple at once. When you're in one headspace it can be optimal to keep doing similar tasks instead of changing your focus to something else.\n\nhas some excellent content on why batching is so great.\n\nMy productivity system is just that --\n\nsystem. Don't feel like you need to adopt all of this or follow any of it. I just hope it's helpful to have a peek into my life and the things that help me. Remember -- balance is\n\nimportant and looks different for everyone. I'm so far from perfect, and I think it can seem like I do so much more than I actually do on social media. I am also in a place in my life where I can spend time on side-work, and I love doing it. Please let me know if you have any questions, or I can answer any questions on\n\n!\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nI'm going to give Toggl a try!\n\nThanks for the article <3\n\nDefinitely use Toggle! I recently started using it and loved it!\n\nsomeone with my style of productivity! Techniques like Pomodoro never made sense to me; I tend to zone into an activity for hours at a time before needing a break. I've been in a quarantine-induced rut lately, so something like Toggl and the \"Flowtime\" technique should definitely help with visualizing my todos day-to-day.\n\nA lot of gems in here. Bookmarking in case I need motivation in the future \ud83d\ude01\n\nVery cool your publication. I really liked Google Keep, it will help me a lot in the division between my school studies and computer technician studies and with my remote repository on GitHub, because sometimes I get very excited, I start coding at 8 am and I stop just for lunch, so I start again and so on until 4 in the morning. I completely forget that I need to study for the entrance exam to enter a university.\n\nI like your thoughts about concentration, reminds me of\n\nprinciples you can find in Cal Newport\u2019s book. I\u2019m just\n\nabout improving as a developer, and I put a big focus on productivity, with one chapter dedicated to deep work :)\n\nGreat article! It seems that you have been working on yourself for a long time and also observing and analyzing all the records and documents too. Just a guess though! I loved many short, sweet, straight but very effective sentences like whatever you have said in the very first paragraph and in the conclusion. Thanks for sharing what has worked for you! Kudos to your efforts... Have a productive day ahead... Keep shining, Keep inspiring \ud83d\ude03\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf8a\n\nHey guys, I have been working on my very first APIs project and in that project I'm making a \"QUIZ APP\", where from an API. I have been taking 10 question and giving them multiple choices and at end they will be getting scored. I'm using NODE.JS, EXPRESS, REQUEST, EJS for the app.\n\nThe problem comes here when i get a string from API. I change it to an object using JSON.parse() and sending it to EJS files and then displayed. but when their are symbols in question like \", ' , and more they are displayed as &139; , \" like that.\n\nAlways interesting to read others' routines. I've recently added kaizen to my workflow, meaning that I look for a small step to improve a process every day. It had the most impact on my personal life so far. For example, yesterday I improved the way I prepare avocado for eating (there's a better way to deal with kernels than what I had been doing). I got the ideas from\n\n.\n\nAnother tool that I use in a similar way to the flowtime technique is RescueTime checking the report from time to time to see in which categories I was working on and how the time was spent.\n\nI have tried Pomodoro technique and I am on the same page as you that I don't need breaks too often. Will try to understand what is Flowtime, thanks for sharing this \ud83d\udc4d\n\nnote taking and scheduling has always seemed as a work itself...\n\ni guess it takes practice to implement it as a daily habit :)\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

I'm an extrovert, and the social environment at work helps to motivate me and get me through the day. That being said, due to COVID and the evolving nature of tech work, I've been working remote for almost two years. There are a lot of benefits to it, like no commute time, the ability to live wherever, more flexibility, and accessibility. Also, I know it's a huge privilege to be able to work remote during this time, and so few of my non-tech friends have that ability. But, for me, working remote doesn't come naturally. So, I wanted to write down my strategies for making it as enjoyable as possible.\n\nI also want to note before starting that right now many of us are working through the stress of a pandemic, shifting to new modalities at work, struggling with economic instability and unemployment, shifting childcare responsibilities, and dealing with health concerns for ourselves and our families. None of this is normal, make sure to take time for yourself and it's okay to not be okay.\n\nThis may sound super corny, but mentally having some sort of \"commute\" to work in the morning and after work in the evening creates some separation in your day. I have a dog, which makes this even easier -- I walk her at the beginning of the day before work and then take her to the park at the end of the day. I also have time to sneak in a bit of a podcast or an audiobook too.\n\nWhen I started working remote, I lived alone. It made work from home really hard because if I didn't actively make plans, I could go days without talking to another human. Earlier this year, I moved in with my partner. Now, I am guaranteed to talk to someone pretty much every day, and I feel much less isolated.\n\nEven if living with another person isn't a reality, having a pet really helps. Having Blair, my dog, makes me get out of the house, and I still have someone with me all day, even if she isn't human. I get cuddles during my breaks, and I even sometimes get a ball thrown at me!\n\nWhen I started working remote, I lived in an apartment that had essentially been my crash pad before. It was in a perfect location, but wasn't very large and was very old -- it didn't even have a real kitchen! I worked out of a desk in my bedroom. So, I was pretty much in that room for 22+ hours a day. It wasn't great for me mentally to not have a separate workspace, and there wasn't much separation between my work and the rest of my life. I know it isn't realistic for everyone, especially those with families or who live in cities with high rent and low square footage, but having a dedicated workspace that you can close off at the end of the day is\n\nand helps you really separate work and the rest of your life.\n\nEarlier this year when the pandemic hit, I lived in a very old studio apartment in NYC, and while it was in the perfect location, it also had a horrible mouse problem, the temperature was always off, and I was pretty much in the same room 24 hours a day. It was miserable.\n\nMoving out of that environment has made working from home much more bearable. Especially since my company has a work from home budget. Getting a comfortable chair, a monitor setup that works for me, and customizations that fit my personality make my workday so much more enjoyable. It has also become a lot more important for me to live in a nice space, and instead of prioritizing living close to work or right downtown, I'm more concerned with living somewhere that's updated, doesn't have a lot of issues, and has space to move around.\n\nEven though I think it's really helpful to have a dedicated workspace, I also move throughout my apartment throughout the day. I do a few hours of work at my desk, then take calls from the couch or the dining room table if I don't need a monitor. It's nice to change the scenery and have a different chair at some point in the day. It helps me re-focus as the day goes on.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of working in an office is the ability to grab or eat lunch with work friends each day. Something I do at least once a week is schedule a lunchtime video call with a friend, whether they are inside of my company or external. It really breaks up the day, recharges me, and keeps those connections intact.\n\nOne of the really nice parts of working remote is that other than calls, you can normally schedule your day to fit your schedule and how you work best rather than being standardized to a 9-5. I often read the advice to always get ready for work. I instead normally put on makeup and get dressed nicely mid-day when I don't have early meetings. I also sometimes take runs during my lunch break, and I often work a 7-3 or 8-4 day instead of 9-5. Use the flexibility to your advantage and work a schedule that fits your needs.\n\nThis is much less relevant now since there's a pandemic going on, but I think it's so important to still socialize with friends and do things outside of your house. It can be tempting to become a hermit since you have to actively leave your house to do things after work, but you still need social interaction and to experience life outside your living space. I find making plans with friends makes me more accountable and likely to do things. Even now, setting up virtual or park hangouts adds some variety to the day!\n\nThis is, again, more of a post-pandemic recommendation, but before COVID I used to do co-working days with friends who also work remote. I would either have them over, or we would meet at a coffee shop and we would work together on each of our work tasks. It's a great opportunity to catch up and have the opportunity to have someone to chat with throughout the day.\n\nOne of the things I miss most about working in an office is unstructured discussion time with colleagues. Most remote calls have a structure and an agenda, but so much valuable brainstorming comes from free-flowing discussions. On past teams, we've scheduled watercooler time or virtual team happy hours, and it's been great to get to know one another and come up with ideas.\n\nEven though most things are remote now, having a community who understands what you do and who you can learn from is so important. I love so many Discord and Slack groups in addition to public forums like DEV and Twitter. They allow me to stay involved with the larger developer community.\n\nRemote work is an increasing piece of work in tech, and I know that it's a really amazing thing for a lot of people, especially parents and those who are disabled. There are many nice pieces of it, like being able to live wherever, no commute times, and the flexibility. That being said, the decrease in work/life separation and the decrease in social time also makes it difficult. Also, this year we aren't just working remote, we are working during a pandemic -- and many people have additional responsibilities as a result. I hope these tips are helpful!\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nI think it's a very important article! Not everyone will be naturally prone to working remote. One thing I have been thinking about lately is how to foster a remote company culture that is actually fun to work in? Remote video calls are good but there's no substitute for face to face interactions (yet). In the remote community there's been so much focus on co-workers who don't like each other and they are forced into an office, watercooler drama, etc. but what about if the co-workers are kickass and it's a genuine fun experience to interact.\n\nalso I was wondering: how to make remote video lunches not turn into some kind of weird live ASMR session ? \ud83e\udd23\n\nYeah I guess everything has pros and cons. Personally I like remote work, even before everyone was forced to. So I already made sure my work space is very nice.\n\nI think it's important to be disciplined and be good at planning if you work from home, otherwise there is no routine and boundaries. Also, for parents I think it's extra challenge, especially if they have limited space. But perhaps WFH also allows people to move to suburb or smaller and less expensive city/town, so they can actually afford better living standard.\n\nAnyone have a link to that wallpaper \ud83d\udc40\n\nYes!\n\nThank you!! \ud83d\udc95\n\nExcellent advice. I've done a lot of these same things for most of my career (which has been 95% WFH self-employment).\n\nI will add, I suggest finding a group of friends that can do social time on video calls of some kind. I've been seriously considering an early morning \"Coffe with Seth\" type stuff to give other early birds like me someone to chit chat with about work stuff, or to just shoot the breeze at a regularly scheduled time.\n\nI've actually found myself really engaged with streamers when I never was before. That can be a lot of fun to find a small streamer and get to interact with whatever they are doing. I enjoy being helpful when I can.\n\nThanks for this post! Although I am not an extrovert, I\u2019m way on the opposite end it is important to be mindful of how we are spending our days now. It\u2019s been a real balance trying to make sure I stay healthy mentally and not fall into becoming a hermit. I have resorted to forming a pod with basically my partner and housemates and that has been super helpful to stay active.\n\nis that 13\" mac comfortable to work for you? I previously tried to work on it on a previous job, but without an external monitor it was horrible, such a small screen to work. Never considered a 16\" instead of this one? Or mobility is your top priority there?\n\nGreat post Ali\n\nThanks for this!! Having a separate place to work and pets really help\n\nYES, I agree with all those great ideas.\n\nMy FAV; Get out of the house! Feeling pent up? For people with yards or front porches, just sit outside for 5 minutes. Get that Vitamin D!\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

In a recent\n\n, we discussed computer science degrees, bootcamps, and self-directed learning. Each has benefits and have brought a lot of people into the world of programming. Each also has challenges. All four of us have had unique paths to programming, so here are our stories.\n\nI was a biology major in college and then quickly realized that I was terrible at it. So, I switched to actuarial science where I took an intro to computer science course and totally fell in love with binary, hexadecimal, and octal systems. The rest is really history. I studied computer science and my first language was Java. I was a little bit of a late bloomer but I thoroughly enjoy it.\n\nI got started when I was 11 years old. I wanted to build my own community on Neopets. If you\u2019re not familiar with what Neopets is, it\u2019s this Web site where you can have your own virtual pet and you can feed it and play games. You can have your own communities and all kinds of stuff.\n\nI really wanted to build my own community and customize it. But you need to know how to code to do that. So, I asked my dad for an HTML book and my first book was HTML goodies. I thought it was awesome and a lot of fun.\n\nFast forward to high school, and I took AP Computer Science. My first language in high school was Java, and I was so bad at it that I needed a tutor just to pass the class. I was like \"I\u2019m never going to do this ever.\" But, you know, obviously, 17 years later and I\u2019m very clearly still coding, so something eventually clicked but it wasn\u2019t Java.\n\nI was an admin assistant really aimlessly going through my job; I was miserable. My dad suggested coding to me and was like \"worst case scenario if you hate it you could try something else.\"\n\nSo, he bought me an \u201dIntroduction to Drupal\u201d book and \u2013 quite frankly, I do not recommend starting out as Drupal when you\u2019re learning to code but that\u2019s how I did. I just continue learning, continue working in the mornings before work. Then I got my first Drupal job.\n\nA few years into that I started learning about accessibility. Then a year or so after that I started learning about React and VueJS and I\u2019m now a React developer and the rest is kind of history.\n\nI learned to code when I was a sophomore in college. I had no idea what coding even was, but I had an extra course block available. I decided to sign up for it because people kept telling me, \u201dIt\u2019s a good thing to learn and it\u2019ll help you no matter what.\u201d\n\nI honestly thought that I was going to be learning how to format Word documents or something like that - I had no idea what code was. But, I was instead writing Python. It was super fun: we were building games. I just thought it was magical how you could put stuff together and have a program come out of it.\n\nI completely reconfigured my schedule and was like I\u2019m going to double major in computer science, this is my future. So, I started my second class which was in C++ and it was a super intense \"Data Structures and Algorithms\" class, which was also a weed out class. I was pulling all-nighters and working so hard in that class just to understand it. I did come out of it with a good grade. I thought \"if I have to work this hard for it, it means that I\u2019m not good enough at it. This is really just not for me.\"\n\nThen when I was a Junior in college I had an internship doing mostly Excel data analysis type work, and I figured out that I could automate a lot of my own job using the Python skills that I had. So, from there, I got a software engineering internship and transitioned to working full time in code.\n\nYou can listen to the\n\nwhere we discussed our thoughts on bootcamps, computer science degrees, and self-directed learning as well as advice for everyone in the midst of their journies.\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nI love origin stories!\n\nI think the major takeaway is that it doesn't matter how you get started - just get started, and keep going.

I was at a job that wasn't the right fit for me, and I didn't know my future. I decided that rather than signing a new lease, I'd instead mostly live at tech conferences for the summer and crash at my parents' in between, and then start living out of AirBnBs in the Fall. I ended up retiring from the digital nomad lifestyle in order to work in an office gain (which started 3 days before the COVID shutdown \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f). That being said, I think this is a pretty unique experience, but more people may be able to do the same as remote work becomes more popular and (hopefully) the pandemic starts to subside. So, I wanted to write down my thoughts and advice on the experience.\n\nI personally chose to live out of AirBnBs. The longer you book a place, the more discount you get normally. So, I'd book a place for a month at a time. The cost for AirBnB pluses ended up being less than my DC rent most months. The van life idea is so appealing to me, but the mechanical knowledge needed and the potential lack of internet intimidates me. I also personally stayed in the United States because of my dog, I didn't want to quarantine her which you need to do with most international countries.\n\nI travelled from city to city in my car, which was super nice. I was able to visit a bunch of sites nearby cities instead of just staying downtown, which I may have had to without a car.\n\nI chose cities by expense, activities available, and their proximity to National Parks. My biggest bucket list item is to visit all of the National Parks, so this very much helped in that goal. I loved being able to experience different areas, taste test different restaurants, and to never get bored of my surroundings. I also was using it as a way to vet cities before settling down -- I didn't know where I wanted to move longterm, so this was a way of trying out different cities.\n\nTaxes can get\n\ncomplicated if you're moving around a bunch, especially if you move internationally or are self-employed (or just have side gigs like me). I hired an accountant who specializes in digital nomads, and it's such a weight off my chest.\n\nis his site in case you're interested.\n\nThere were two really difficult attributes of travel for me: the first was loneliness, the second was the lack of a routine. It's pretty tough to get to know people when you aren't staying in a city for long. Something I would probably prioritize if I did this again would be to go to cities with a big tech scene so I could go to meetups and potentially speak at them. I was also single at the time, so doing this with a partner or a family would probably help in that regard. As far as having a routine, I was changing where I lived every month. So it's difficult to get too settled. Part of that was nice, I would go on hikes every morning with my dog in Asheville and would go to a neighborhood coffee shop in Nashville. But, I definitely missed having a set workday schedule.\n\nOverall, it's an experience I really enjoyed and would highly recommend if your work and life situations allow it. I would probably go back to being a digital nomad once the country re-opens and my partner was able to work remote. If you're interested in moving internationally,\n\nthis Ladybug episode. Please\n\nany questions to me, I'd love to help out!\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nThis is exactly what I would like to do but kinda afraid to take the plunge. I too had a plan to visit different cities and just go to tech conferences and meetups but I\u2019m unsure if I should without a car and use public transport or not. Also I am a freelancer so it\u2019s feast or famine when it comes to money.\n\nCosmic timing Ali ! I\u2019m about to do this my self.. I\u2019ve been at a job that allows me to do this for about a year now , and my lease is up in July , so as soon as it is , I want to sell all my stuff and do it while I\u2019m still single and not having kids\n\nThank you so much for the heads up , in regards to loneliness and lack of routing - being a creature of habit I think I too would seriously miss this aspect Of everyday existence the most  ...\n\nPerHaps if I stayed longer than a month , like at least 3 at a time , it would enough to feel settled in .\n\nAnd to combat loneliness - I am pretty violently extroverted and usually end up making friends wherever I go .. just difficult when they don\u2019t speak English .\n\nAwesome! Yeah, hopefully by then things will be more open and you can go to events. I think that will be really helpful :)\n\nReally cool to share this experience! I would love to do something similar in Europe but am always a bit scared about the lack of routine and how hard would it be to meet people and build relationships in short term.\n\nThis post inspired me though! Thank you\n\nWhat if you are planning this in the country where you live right now.?\n\nI would be less scared if I plan it \"smaller\".\n\nAnd probably you already will get some good experience and confidence to do it in the whole Europe.\n\nThat is also a valid idea :) I am living in Austria currently, so small country if compared to where I come from, but still there are other cities where would be cool to live for a while!\n\nNeat! Thanks for sharing, especially the accountant bit!\n\nWe plan to launch in 2023. I joined a community called\n\nlast year, and I'll be keeping my membership up until the big day because there is just so much to learn! There are people in this community that do it with AirBnB like you. One of the other benefits is the private small groups in the community, such as the one for IT Professionals.\n\nStarlink will be in full swing by then, so hopefully we'll be more connected than ever so that we can be more disconnected than ever. Wrap your mind around that!\n\nOne of the things you said really stood out to me, and that was your comment about DC rent. In Annapolis we are are shelling out $3,700 a month between childcare and rent, and I didn't know how well that would prepare me for places like Norway which famously costs you about $25-35 dollars for fish and chips and a pint. Cool, we do that, too!\n\nIt comes up a lot in the group, because there is someone experiencing the digital nomad life at every level from financially independent to the most frugal families you've ever met. The first question I asked was whether or not I was ridiculous for wanting a 5th wheel for the three of us when there are people cramming 12 into a vintage Airstream, and I found that it's all about what is comfortable for you. It set me at ease. This is going to be our home for a few years while we are roadschooling/unschooling, after all.\n\nOh, and national parks are high on our list, too. \ud83d\ude04 I want to fill out one of the passports.\n\nWow, that sounds awesome!\n\nI consider every now and then to \"travel\" around the UK.\n\nAs I am not working in IT yet, my plan is/was to apply a global company which has stores around the country, so I can transfer myself between stores/businesses.  So, I would spend 2-5 months in each city on my list, keep working so I have income and the same time I explore everything in my free time.\n\nAs I came from another country without partner or family member, I already have experience how to spend my free time without feeling alone or lonely.\n\nThere are some really cool meetups and activity groups around the country which I would love to visit.\n\nWhat a cool goal you had! Staying nearby National Parks! If the possibility to work remotely stays in my company, I'd also consider moving closer to the mountains.\n\nThanks for sharing, Ali! I'm planning to be a digital nomad from next year first locally (in my country) and then internationally for the next few years.\n\nIt sounds exciting. Where would you like to go? Which cities are on your list?\n\nWe are planning to do the same next year, but go around Europe and Asia - I will document our adventures as digital nomads :)\n\nWhat a wonderful way to work, Id welcome the private time and time for me. That sounds like a bucket list item I may need to add.\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

I can tell I am going in that direction and I hope I can continue to achieve the good parts of that situation.\n\nAlong these lines, I really appreciated this post:\n\nWe humans must find a certain contentment in whatever situation we find ourselves in, but in terms of situations to position one's self to be in.

Not many Romanians know about it. It\u2019s more of a regional thing. The people who would cook and eat \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie used to be shepherds. It\u2019s also possible that other cultures have a similar dish but I haven\u2019t yet met someone from outside my family that can describe anything similar to \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie.\n\n\u021a\u0103c\u0103lie is rich in calories and fat and it\u2019s best served hot. The caloric value it offers is extremely important for people like shepherds because of the long hours on the cold mountains. The ingredients and method of making \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie are also accessible. All they\u2019d have to do is carry a chunk of pig fat, some bread and an onion, then make a little fire.\n\nFor me \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie used to be a normal thing, whenever we\u2019d have a family BBQ, \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie was the first thing we made. I really enjoyed it as a kid and took years to learn the proper way of cooking it. Anybody can easily cook \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie but it takes multiple attempts to get all the little details right and perfect your method. This will only lead to the best of \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie, so well cooked that angles will weep for a taste of it.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until high school and talking with some friends that I realised I am the only one who knows about \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie.\n\nI cooked some \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie for some friends of mine and some couldn\u2019t even dare taste it. For some it is\n\nextremely heavy (you\u2019ll understand why shortly).\n\nWarning: Vegans and vegetarians will flee when exposed to \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie\n\n(pig fat with rind, Romanians call it\n\n)\n\nFor cooking you\u2019ll also need a stick (size matters, anything between 30-50cm should be good enough). Make sure the stick is strong enough to hold the chunk of pig fat and not too dry (spoiler alert, it all goes above a fire).\n\nWarning: Do not use a metal stick, the pig fat will slide right out after heating up. I recommend a cherry tree branch with a sharpened tip.\n\nTo get things started slightly cut your pig fat on all sides (excluding the skin side). Do not make the cuts too deep, as it could make it fall apart later. We do this to allow for better and more evenly cooking.\n\nNow cut the bread (slices, about 1cm thick, you can do thicker slices if you feel \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie is too heavy for you) and onion (any shape or size you like, I prefer rings). Place the onions slices/rings on the slices of bread and set everything near your grill.\n\nAt this point you should start your fire. Do not let the flame burn out, \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie is cooked using the flame not active charcoal. Take your stick and put the tip of it inside the fire (enough to chahr it, but don\u2019t set it on fire). Stick your chunk of pig fat on the stick.\n\nThis bit might sound easy but it\u2019s quite tricky to get it right. At this point you should have your chunk of slan\u0103 on the stick, your fire is roaring and the bread with onions is nearby.\n\nRepeat this process until each slice is covered in as much fat as you wish (see final product bellow for reference).\n\nTip: You can use some of the dripping fat to keep the fire alive or to extend it to new sections of the BBQ, thus ensuring you equally activate your charcoal.\n\nTip: When dripping fat on the bread, feel free to slowly and gently press the slan\u0103 on the bread.\n\nMaster tip: Sometimes the tip of your stick will set on fire.\n\n, this is the best thing that could happen but be careful. You can now tilt your stick with the tip facing almost completely down. Keep the stick above the bread and watch how the tiny flame will make the pig fat drip.\n\nAfter doing the above\n\na couple of times you will notice the exterior of the pig fat is cooked, at this point set it near your bread and start cutting the outer layer, revealing more raw uncooked pig fat ready for roasting.\n\nThe cooked fat is placed on top of the bread for added unhealthy pure tastiness.\n\nTip: At the point when you start cutting the first layer of cooked slan\u0103, you might want to take a short break and eat a slice, as \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie is best served hot. Reheating it is an option.\n\nNote: After cutting outer layers, make sure to make some more cuts on the surface to allow for more fat dripping and better roasting.\n\nAgain, repeat the above until all pig fat is cooked. Depending on the rind you have, it may be easy to bite trough and crunchy or extremely tough. It is comestible tho and I personally enjoy it.\n\nThis is how the final product should look like:\n\nIf you weren\u2019t disgusted by possibly the most unhealthy edible thing you\u2019ve ever heard, then you should know a couple of things."}

It was a nice sunny day, hopped on the early 7:45 train to Hope,\n\n. Little did I know that was the start of my new hobby and passion, hiking; as I recently went to Peak District again, done\n\nand the\n\ntrails. More on this down bellow.\n\nI tried to cover the most important aspects of my trip, but hiking is all about the moment and the experience. Hard to put into words the beauty of nature.\n\nBy far the best thing about going away from the day to day city craze, was the silence. After the train left the station, all I could hear was \u2026 nothing. Pure silence. It then occurred to me, that I have\n\nsomething, in a very long time. I had forgotten what silence was; the pure tranquility sensation.\n\nOn the first Hike, I did the climb to Ladybower Dam and got to see quite a bit of nature, the rural areas around Hope and saw how friendly outdoorsy people are. Everyone would salute you and people were more than eager to give directions and help you.\n\nAfter the rather easy hike to the dam, I went up to Win hill, where the view was very rewarding, as the climb is on some steep rocks trough a forested area with a stream of water on the side. From the peak you could see all around the valley and could even see the dam. The walk back down was much easier and quicker as it followed a path down and around the hill instead of climbing rocks.\n\nI would say that the first hiking experience wasn\u2019t that eventful, but nonetheless it was a special moment and the start of something beautiful.\n\nThis took place mid October on a cloudy day with some light rain. The hike was considerably longer than the first one (10km), and this time it involved walking across the peaks of Loose Hill. The view was nice, but due to the clouds and fog, visibility was limited.\n\nThe best part of this hike was the end destination, and what would end up becoming my new post-hike\n\n.\n\nA nice cozy place, right next to Edale Station. The staff there are like a big family, they\u2019re friendly and warm. The decor of the restaurant is homy and the food is just what you need after a long hike. On Sunday they have roast (pork or beef) with veggies and Yorkshire pudding. They also sell local ales (which are some of the best and most refreshing beers I\u2019ve had). To get an idea of how good the beer is, I asked if they sell bottles of the stuff (sadly no), so next time I\u2019ll see if I can bring my own bottle \ud83c\udf7a.\n\nThey are welcoming people, \u201cmuddy boots are welcome\u201d and \u201cdogs are welcome\u201d.\n\nLast weekend I spontaneously decided to go hiking again. I simply craved it, weather was good (by UK standards) and train tickets were still cheap. So I did it. Since my last hike I even invested in a hydration pack and some light, foldable, and strong hiking poles (which came in handy!).\n\nThe hike started off with a superb walk above a brook, trees with red, orange and yellow leaves, you get to cross a couple of rustic looking wooden bridges. The brooks valley even gets narrower and the hills on both sides are quite steep, giving an amazing feel when walking between em.\n\nAbout 2km in, the hike transforms into a little bit of a climb. The path becomes one with the brook and you have to carefully navigate your way from rock to rock on the brook. Then the elevation begins to take off, you start climbing up some rocks, with the brook still there. Making this a treacherous climb where one must be very confident in every move. The climb is about 1km with an elevation gain of 500m. For me that\u2019s the steepest path I had to take so far, but the climb is full of breathtaking scenery and as you go higher you get to see more and more of where you came from.\n\nUpon reaching the peak, you realise it\u2019s actually a plateau and you can see the entire valley where you walked. A little further in, most people will proceed to climb to an even higher peak, but not me. My trail map said\n\nand so I did.\n\nWhat was I expecting? From the map, I knew the trail would pass trough the\n\n. I expected a nice area, abundant in vegetation and tall trees, you know\n\n.\n\nWhat did I get?\n\nThe path I followed (at this point alone, as everybody else would go in the opposite direction) was next to a water stream and as such the ground was rather muddy and soft. Then the trail map said\n\nand so I did. After a while I found myself in a rather muddy area, with no visible path and no obvious direction to follow. The sun was still out and I was about 1/3 of the trail in so I pushed forward.\n\nAfter a kilometre of walking trough some rather shitty conditions (mud and weird terrain), fog set in out of a sudden; combined with the lack of a path and the only direction I knew being\n\n, I pushed on like any sane person would do.\n\nNot 5 minutes later I was in the middle of a post-apocalyptic scenario. Fog everywhere, terrain at this point was composed of\n\ncombined with\n\nand\n\n.\n\nThis is when it hit me. I am in a swamp.\n\nThere were many questions going on in my head at the time:\n\nI realised that I might not have the time (sunset was 2-3 hours away) to juggle around the terrain of the swamp, so I took a split second decision and I started going\n\nin the hopes of intersecting with the public footpath sooner rather than later.\n\nAfter adventuring trough the swamp like a mad man, trying to reach some solid ground.

I hacked into their computer and captured the USB traffic on it. Could you help me steal the secret?\n\nFlag format: flag{0-9a-z_} (Convert uppercase to lowercase)\n\nAttachments:\n\nFor this challenge, we are given a pcapng that contains USB protocol packets.\n\nMost of the packets are input packets labeled as\n\nby wireshark. There are, however, a few exceptions:\n\nThis packet and the one below it caught my attention because they are both output packets and contains ascii characters that resemble some sort of programming language.\n\nI copied one of the lines and did a quick google search.\n\nis what I found - a TSPL/TSPL2 Programming Language manual. Just like how 3d printers are controlled using G-code, it seems like that printers also have their own programming language.\n\nHere are the commands within the two packets:\n\nThe second packet seems to be the one that actually draws out the flag using two different commands:\n\nand\n\n. Now, I just have to implement the two commands in python and get the flag.\n\nHere is the code for that:\n\nIn the end, we get an image with the flag:\n\nflag:\n\nwho likes singing, dancing, rapping and shell-coding?\n\nThe directories on the server looks something like this:\n\nnc 139.180.215.222 20002\n\nnc 106.52.252.82 20002\n\nAttachments:\n\nAfter a quick analysis of the binary given, we see that the binary reads in 7 bytes of data, zero out most of the registers, and executes the data as shellcode.\n\n7-byte is not a lot. The\n\ninstruction itself takes up 2 bytes. Due to this size limitation, I decided to go with a two-stage approach. First, I will craft a 7-byte payload that will make a read syscall and read in a second stage payload. Second, I will craft a second stage payload that is more than 7 bytes and perform whatever task I want without worrying about any size limitations.\n\nI ran the binary in gdb just to see the state of the registers when our shellcode is being called. This is helpful as it allows us to utilize some of the existing register values:\n\nAs you can see, there\u2019s not a lot to work with, but we do have the address of the current buffer loaded in rdi.\n\nIn order to make the read syscall, we need four things:\n\nWe know that the syscall itself takes up 2 bytes and copying the address of the current buffer from rdi to rsi takes at least 2 bytes. This leaves us 3 bytes to zero out rdi and make rdx a large number:\n\nMy first idea was to move the address of the current buffer to rdx as it is quite a large number; however, it turns out to be too large and would not work.\n\nLooking for inspiration, I came across\n\n. Although it is written for 32 bit instead of 64 bit, it is still quite useful and helped me came up with my final payload:\n\nThis payload only uses 6 bytes of space! It relayed on the fact that\n\nis a single byte instruction, and due to its 32 bit nature, the current address is truncated to only 4 bytes before being loaded into rdx.\n\nNow, we successfully bypassed the size limitation and can run whatever code we want; however, the execve syscall seems to be blocked on the server. Bummer!\n\nBut we can still do an open/read/write to get the flag right? Well, now is a good time to review the challenge description:\n\nThe directories on the server looks something like this:\n\nAs you can see, the flag is hidden in a nested folder, and we need a way to find the path for the flag file.\n\nBasically, we need a way to list the content in a given directory. The first thing that came to me was the\n\ncommand, so I ran a strace on it:\n\nAll that we need is two syscalls:\n\nwhich opens a file descriptor for a given path and\n\nwhich list out the content of a directory.\n\nWith the help of the shellcraft module in pwntools, I quickly created a payload that can read out the content of a given directory:\n\nAnother minor inconvenience is the fact that the\n\nsyscall returns a linux_dirent struct for each file which needs to be parsed. Lucky, we can do that on the client side with python instead of parsing it with assembly:\n\nNow, with the ability to list all files in a given directory, we just need a program to recursively go through all the folders and find the flag file.\n\nBecause the server always timeouts before the flag file can be found, I also added the functionality to preserve progress so that I can get the path using multiple sessions.\n\nHere is the final code:\n\nWith this code, I found the flag file located at\n\n.\n\nNow with a simple payload, we can read out the flag:\n\nflag:"}

I got a letter which asked to be present at the customs office in 3 days.\n\nI went to the customs office. Had a talk with a super helpful lady, who helped me get my shipment. She then asked me to open the package, did an inspection of what was shipped. Finally, she told me the import duty  which I had to pay for the shipment. In less than 15 minutes I was out of the office and my job was done.\n\nOne month ago someone again shipped me a piece of gadget. This time it was sent to Kathmandu, Nepal. FedEx told me that my shipment was at the airport customs and I had to get hold of an agent at the customs to get my shipment. They delivered me the documents which I could use to extract the shipment.\n\nAll good and fine. I talked to an agent and handed him my documents, which were to be used to extract the shipment from the customs. I hoped it to be a quick and painless process. Unfortunately, the introduction of an agent to the process keeps us in the dark; Now, I have no idea what\u2019s going on in customs land.\n\nEach of my discussion with the customs agent was basically that the shipment couldn\u2019t be extracted and they\u2019ll try again tomorrow. After ~20 days I pushed the agent a little and tried to get more details. According to them, someone had shipped gold via FedEx which is why customs were not letting any FedEx document be extracted.\n\nI went to the customs office, and It was chaotic. It took me hours to find the right person to talk to. Basically, just to hear the same gold story again.\n\nIn the mean time, I mentioned this to FedEx as well, the only support they could give me was \u201cI\u2019ll talk to my superior and see how we can help you here\u201d\n\nFast forward today, I still don\u2019t have my shipment. Nepal Government still doesn\u2019t have the customs duty they deserve. Lose-Lose situation. Unless, my shipment has been hijacked and a customs official has gifted it to his son. Then, someone does win here. Believe me, I have heard stories of that happening.\n\nThis process is seriously messed up and is the story of pretty much every government office in Nepal. The processes in offices are so chaotic, super ad-hoc and enough touch points to exploit a person. Which is also the reason why going to a government office is a dreadful experience every time.\n\nOur systems are messed up, our processes are messed up and the sad part is that there is no one doing anything about it. The only place one can complain or state grievances is to a twitter handle (or bot) of HelloSarkar.

Contrary to the fact that a lot would suggest to do it at a startup, I wanted to do it at a big company because I have never worked at one and wanted to learn from that experience. It must be magic to manage so many people, so many developers and still spit out the best of the products.\n\nI applied to number of companies but I would like to comment on my experience with facebook, microsoft and mozilla. Facebook was kind of sad because I had an interview where I was asked some basic questions about JavaScript and we talked about how some things were implemented in facebook. Post the interview, they didnt reply for about a month and when I contacted the recruiter, got a reply that I couldn\u2019t be offered a postition. Sad :\u2018(\n\nNext was Microsoft. This one was really surprising because the interviewer asked me some really random question and two puzzles and eventually replied with a negative. Maybe I was supposed to not solve the puzzles.\n\nWhen all this action was happening, I had also applied for an internship at mozilla. This was one that I had some expectations from, mostly because I had been a contributor to mozilla for some time and luckily there was an open internship position for a project that I had already been contributing to. I applied and Kaboom, \u201cwe did not find a fit this time\u201d. This was very disheartening, but I eventually talked to one of the project devs about it and he told that he\u2019d look into it. About a week later, I got an email from a recruiter saying they\u2019d like to interview me for the internship. Yay!\n\nWell, that did sound awesome, I hopped into the opportunity and did some reading, sharpening that blade. I had 3 really interesting interviews and after quite a long wait I got an email which basically said that they\u2019d like to move with another candidate mostly because he had more experience and I still had a year of university to learn from(o_O).\n\nSo, basically after this I was quite sad and felt really bad. I for one thought a lot about this and there were the times when I thought maybe I was not good at all. This brought me to think about some of my open source contributions as well. I used to contribute to open source mostly because I was learning a lot and learned a lot about good code, code review, processes and approach to some serious problems. But, with of all of this it also felt like why was I even contributing to a project where I was not even worth it. Sadly, I do feel that at times, but I like it when I learn.\n\nI know recruiting is a tough work and there are some tough and quick decisions to make because of which a lot of factors come into play like where one comes from, where one is currently located, one\u2019s name and lots of other tiny details. I dont say its intentional but everyone is judgemental when you have to make a decision. That is why I know lots of amazing people back in India and Nepal who have been rejected who I think are among the A grade talent and lots of people would agree to me. Maybe there\u2019s a problem, one that seriously needs to be solved. But yes, this doesn\u2019t change the fact that I may be useless as well (lets hope I\u2019m not).\n\nWell, I have been conspirating on some secret schemes with a bunch of amazing people and I must say, I am enjoying it. Regarding contributing to mozilla, I would be (as a developer)inactive for a while, for sure, maybe a lot more. But I am still the guy who contributes to the open web and loves to see the web crossing it boundaries."}

It was a great hike with a nice weather accompanied with some beautiful landscapes. Perfect recipe for a good hike.\n\nLike every other hikes, this one also helped me think deeply and contemplate about a number of things. Among them, most of my energy was spent on thinking about the hike itself.\n\nMost of it was directed towards how can we use Hike for Nepal to create some positive impact, possibly in the hiking location, during the hike. How can we bring some positive change, slowly and steadily.\n\nOne of the things that I noticed, the hike was full of well educated Nepalese who were decently well off (approximately 1 out of 5 had a DSLR, everyone had a pretty good camera phone). This was a great group of people, possibly a specific group that could do a lot for the community. Another topic that bugged me considerably during the hike was all the plastic packaging that was littered over the place. It was sad, how ignorant we have been towards our environment. From Wai-Wai packets to empty bottles everywhere. The first thing that we could definitely do to fight this is by cleaning the mountains and hills during our hikes. I did my part during the hike and we did something similar in one of our hikes in the Bavarian Alps.\n\nThe question that I would like to ask is, how can we scale this idea of cleaning the mountains during our hike? How do we scale it from one person to the whole group. The biggest benefit of this would be that hikers would learn to clean the mountains and take back their own garbage with them. Thus, ensuring the mountains to be clean, the nature to be serene and experiences to be breathtaking.\n\nFinally, I would like to remind one of the rules from the Golden Rules for Living\n\nIf you open it, close it.\nIf you turn it on, turn it off.\nIf you unlock it, lock it up.\nIf you break it, admit it.\nIf you can\u2019t fix it, call in someone who can.\nIf you borrow it, return it.\nIf you value it, take care of it.\n\nIf you move it, put it back.\nIf it belongs to someone else and you want to use it, get permission.\nIf you don\u2019t know how to operate it, leave it alone.\nIf it\u2019s none of your business, don\u2019t ask questions.\nIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it.\nIf it will brighten someone\u2019s day, say it.\nIf it will tarnish someone\u2019s reputation, keep it to yourself.\n\u2014 Found somewhere in the vast vast internet, Source unknown"}
{"url": "https://avinash.com.np/2015/11/22/on-forgiveness/", "origin": "https://avinash.com.np/", "title": "On Forgiveness", "content": "What do you think is the right course of action, bringing justice by punishment or forgiving the wrongdoer? Fighting the fight for ego or forgiving? These are tough discussions to have and there is enough philosophical evidence to justify either side of the argument. I have come to believe that there is no \u201cright-way\u201d or \u201cthe recipe\u201d that one can follow, one must always think about the implications, the stakeholders involved and the bigger picture and take the righteous action. Even though there is no golden rule there are set of doctrines and frameworks one can follow that is considered to be on a higher moral ground.\n\nMost of the times when we are thinking of forgiveness, the alternate course of action is radical, extreme, one that we consider not ourselves. The reason to be in such a state is generally because our pride has been touched, the ego has been hurt and betrayal has been committed.\n\n.. the same dualism underlies the nature and condition of man. Every excess causes a defect; every defect an excess. Every sweet hath its sour; every evil its good. Every faculty which is a receiver of pleasure has an equal penalty put on its abuse. It is to answer for its moderation with its life. For every grain of wit there is a grain of folly\u2026\n\nEmerson has very nicely said that the world is an equation and everything that is done will have a reaction. If that\u2019s the case then does it not make sense to follow the path of peace and let nature do its job. Why should we take part in the wrongdoing? Because we want to satisfy our ego, want our pride back. What guarantee is there that the pride is restored after the action? None. Maybe it is better to live without pride, without happiness. Being neutral in every sense. Every happiness will have its sadness.\n\nNo man had ever a point of pride that was not injurious to him.\n\nSimilar was the situation of Yudhishthir in Mahabharat when he was persuaded by his wife and brothers to go to war and fight against Duryodhan. This was during their time in exile. His response was that its harder to give forgiveness, it takes more energy to forgive.\n\nForgiveness is the strength of the virtuous. To fight is easy, but to forgive is difficult. To be patient is not to be weak; to seek peace is always the wiser course.\n\nThe epic has it that they went to war, the great battle of kurukshetra took place and after numerous tricks and deceits of Krishna (the charioteer and God) they win the war, they get their kingdom back. At this point of time Yudhishthir doesn\u2019t have pride in winning the war, is not content to have his kingdom back. On the contrary, he is sad, in remorse, in pain, thinking about all the deaths of his teacher, his brothers, his men.\n\nTo get a piece of the earth we totally abandoned men who were equal to the earth, men whom we should never have killed. And now we live with our kinsmen dead and our wealth exhausted\u2026 like dogs we greedily went after a piece of meat! Now our piece of meat is gone, and so are those who would have eaten it. The heroes are dead. The evil is done. Our kindgom has been laid waste. Having killed them, our rage is gone. Now this grief holds me in check!\nExcerpts from Mahabharat -\n\n(The difficulty of being Good)\n\nOne might argue if the path of forgiveness is always the higher moral ground, wouldn\u2019t the world be unfair. What would have happened to slavery in America? what would happen to Indians under the British Raaj ? What would have happened to Jews during WWII ? These are all valid questions and it does seem like forgiveness has a conflict with Justice in a larger sense.\n\nOne way to look at it is by weighing the deeds. Some deeds have so much evil, there is so much bad into it that it is beyond forgiveness or the psychological burden of forgiveness is too high to be granted. This does mean that its not our strength at display but our weakness at display in this case. In Mahabharat, Yudhishthir before going to war, justifies it as his duty and an act he must do even though he doesn\u2019t like it. Maybe the idea is to look at the bigger good and act accordingly. These are nevertheless really tough decisions to make and maybe your duty is what can justify the course of action. Maybe that is how Jack Dorsey would also justify\n\n.\n\nThese are very tough topics to think about and to come to a worthy conclusion. All I can say and suggest is to think of the possibilities, weight all the options, see the impact and then eventually\n\n. One fun learning I\u2019ve had is that, it is much easier to write on this topic than to have a contextual discussion."}

Nothing has changed in the once peaceful country. That peaceful country where people are fighting; They are divided, divided by caste, divided by religion, divided by color, divided by reason, divided without any reason. Fight all day long, fight for your ego, fight for the fake pride and then in the end of the day take pride in being the most peaceful country in the world, take pride in being the most peaceful people, take pride in coming from the land of Buddha. Great, at least we are the quintessential hypocrites.\n\nIt\u2019s sad to see the leaders fighting like children. Oh come on, we had fairer fights when we were kids. It\u2019s funny to see the parties organize a meeting with the other parties, and follow it with their own personal meetings; its clear they have no philosophy, no pride, no compassion, all they want is to maximize their profits. This child play has been the norm in one way; it has pulled everyone centuries behind. Centuries behind in thinking, in science, in contribution to society.\n\nThe smart world is working on nurturing the future generation. We? we have already lost them, we have failed them. Those kids should be studying in school, challenging their teachers, learning from their mentors, painting, drawing and solving that random equation. But, NO! They are everywhere but not where they should be. They are sitting in home playing, they are working in that brick factory where they legally shouldn\u2019t be, and they are lying on that corner of the street burning grass. But then, how could they go to school? The teachers are not motivated to teach the students; In most cases, they are there because that is the last job they could find, one that pays the least and our society has accepted it that way. Why? Simply because they are not a part of the vicious romantic consumerism cycle. If only they could produce something that could be exchanged with money. All they are doing is building the future, adding some fine touches to it, how can that be important? No gains at all!\n\nThe situation is saddening, and its getting worse day by day. Every day a political party is angry, the schools are closed! a wife and a husband have a fight, the schools are closed. I am sure this situation frustrates many more and I am aware that there are wiser beings that are working on fixing this, trying to be a part of the solution. Not rant like me by making a fuss of the problem. I think there is only one right way to solve this problem and its not a quick one, its one that takes its time but does the job. We have to change our culture, our society, our views. Education has to be taken seriously. We have to build better schools, develop infrastructure. Not schools that are money making machines, but schools that are shaping better humans and better futures. Invest the money a school generates into the teachers, into other schools. Build standards, standards that schools have to be built up to. The government has to play an active role in this, the political parties have to play an active role in this, we the citizens have a bigger role to play in this. Government schools have to rise, rise to standards that set benchmarks. The system has to invest into the future, the future that will build the system in return."}

This was a two day event completely focused on developing web applications which would also work on Firefox OS.\n\n###Day 1\nThe first day of the event was aimed at giving the audience an idea of mozilla, the mozilla community and Firefox OS, ofcourse. Vineel started by talking about mozilla and the community, Sayak continued by introducing the idea of Firefox OS and why it was required, Soumya then took on the stage and discussed some technical details about the platform and eventually Robin, Sayak, Biraj and me gave some demos on firefox OS application and the process of writing a basic \u201chello world\u201d application. The talks went pretty well but one thing that struck me was the audience. This was a very different audience, compared to other events because they were paying attention, asking questions, interacting and were actually making sense. Believe me, this rarely happens in an engineering college in India :D.\n\n###Day 2\nThe second day was roughly divided into two parts, the hackaton and the presentations. The hackathon went pretty well and most of the attendees got a taste of, how easy it was to make an application for firefox OS using open web technologies. It was amazing to see about 30 applications being presented at the end of the day. I guess, we can say it was a win!\n\nThat was all about the event. I would like to thank the FORMAT Team, especially Avik, Gaurab and Subhashish for the warm reception and managing the event in such a professional manner. Last but not the least, I got to learn a lot from Biraj, Vineel, Soumya, Robin and Sayak."}

He explains how you can do art with anything and it likes in the eyes of the maker. We then divide into groups based on our tshirt color -\n\n. The whole hike we used materials from nature to build small art pieces. It was the best exercise to get to know other people from our groups.\n\nThe main motive of the hike was for the attendees, speakers and organizers to mingle more and get to network at a more deeper level. I think that\u2019s what exactly happened as I got to talk to so many people and know what they were doing, get an understanding of their point of view and have deeper conversations about tech, life, community and nature.\n\nApart from the main conference and hike, some of the speakers and attendees took the opportunity to do other activities.

In some cases I have also added the reasoning or the idea that is being sent across by the text or just notest that made sense to accompany them. I am still reading the whole essay and will at one point write my thoughts and views on it (maybe).\n\nThe essay mostly talks about why its important to know thyself; why knowing yourself and accepting your thoughts might be tough. The following part of the text talks about the times when one was not courageous enough to speak their heart or do what they heeded to do, and later realized that someone else said/did it and got all the glory (though some parts of the text also deals with why getting the glory, or working to get the glory is not important at all)\n\nA man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within, more than the lustre of the firmament of bards and sages. Yet he dismisses without notice his thought, because it is his. In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts: they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.\n\n.. Else, to-morrow a stranger will say with masterly good sense precisely what we have thought and felt all the time, and we shall be forced to take with shame our own opinion from another.\n\nThis part of the essay deals with one having to do something that they don\u2019t like, but are doing it just because it made sense at one point of time and they don\u2019t want to contradict themselves. It somehow goes into the lines of\n\nwhere one has the mental stress or discomfort because of contradictory beliefs in their mind and are motivated to reduce this dissonance (Based on the definition from wikipedia)\n\nThe other terror that scares us from self-trust is our consistency; a reverence for our past act or word, because the eyes of others have no other data for computing our orbit than our past acts, and we are loath to disappoint them.\n\nBut why should you keep your head over your shoulder? Why drag about this corpse of your memory, lest you contradict somewhat you have stated in this or that public place? Suppose you should contradict yourself; what then? It seems to be a rule of wisdom never to rely on your memory alone, scarcely even in acts of pure memory, but to bring the past for judgment into the thousand-eyed present, and live ever in a new day. In your metaphysics you have denied personality to the Deity: yet when the devout motions of the soul come, yield to them heart and life, though they should clothe God with shape and color. Leave your theory, as Joseph his coat in the hand of the harlot, and flee.\n\nWith consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words, and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said to-day. \u2014 \u2018Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood.\u2019 \u2014 Is it so bad, then, to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh.\n\nThe following paragraph tries to talk about the moment, and how one should live in the present and not sulk in the past or worry about the future. It is somehow way more philosophical compared to the rest of the text till this part. Similar ideas have been mentioned in Buddhist texts that talk about mindfulness and being available for the moment rathar than being in a different point of time.\n\nMan is timid and apologetic; he is no longer upright; he dares not say \u2018I think,\u2019 \u2018I am,\u2019 but quotes some saint or sage. He is ashamed before the blade of grass or the blowing rose. These roses under my window make no reference to former roses or to better ones; they are for what they are; they exist with God to-day. There is no time to them. There is simply the rose; it is perfect in every moment of its existence. Before a leaf-bud has burst, its whole life acts; in the full-blown flower there is no more; in the leafless root there is no less. Its nature is satisfied, and it satisfies nature, in all moments alike. But man postpones or remembers; he does not live in the present, but with reverted eye laments the past, or, heedless of the riches that surround him, stands on tiptoe to foresee the future. He cannot be happy and strong until he too lives with nature in the present, above time.\n\nOn failure, and pressures from the society and believing in yourself.\n\nIf our young men miscarry in their first enterprises, they lose all heart. If the young merchant fails, men say he is ruined. If the finest genius studies at one of our colleges, and is not installed in an office within one year afterwards in the cities or suburbs of Boston or New York, it seems to his friends and to himself that he is right in being disheartened, and in complaining the rest of his life. A sturdy lad from New Hampshire or Vermont, who in turn tries all the professions, who teams it, farms it, peddles, keeps a school, preaches, edits a newspaper, goes to Congress, buys a township, and so forth, in successive years, and always, like a cat, falls on his feet, is worth a hundred of these city dolls. He walks abreast with his days, and feels no shame in not \u2018studying a profession,\u2019 for he does not postpone his life, but lives already. He has not one chance, but a hundred chances. Let a Stoic open the resources of man, and tell men they are not leaning willows, but can and must detach themselves; that with the exercise of self-trust, new powers shall appear; that a man is the word made flesh, born to shed healing to the nations, that he should be ashamed of our compassion, and that the moment he acts from himself, tossing the laws, the books, idolatries, and customs out of the window, we pity him no more, but thank and revere him, and that teacher shall restore the life of man to splendor, and make his name dear to all history.\n\nTo the end of the essay, the author talks about the\n\n. To begin with, I had a totally different view on travelling, like the \u201chow it changes you\u201d and \u201cyou discover yourself\u201d view that the world has, but since the last\n\n\u2044\n\nmonths, I have come to realise that travelling is just a concept that has come from romantic consumerism. Author\n\nbriefly talks about it in his book\n\nas well.

Our first journeys discover to us the indifference of places. At home I dream that at Naples, at Rome, I can be intoxicated with beauty, and lose my sadness. I pack my trunk, embrace my friends, embark on the sea, and at last wake up in Naples, and there beside me is the stern fact, the sad self, unrelenting, identical, that I fled from. I seek the Vatican, and the palaces. I affect to be intoxicated with sights and suggestions, but I am not intoxicated.

I left in between the event as it didn\u2019t rise up to my expectations. I always thought that BarCamps are an open event with an open platform for people to learn and share their thoughts and hacks, atleast that\u2019s the impression one gets when they read about other BarCamps or its wiki. Since I didn\u2019t attend the whole event and didn\u2019t have the chance to give any feedback to the organizers or the team, I would take this as an opportunity.\n\nFirst of all, I felt very unhappy that the event was called a \u2018BarCamp\u2019 but didn\u2019t follow any of the unconventional conventions of a \u2018BarCamp\u2019. It would\u2019ve been better to name it different (to suit and cater to the proper audience) or to have made it a BarCamp style\u2019d event.\n\nSecond, Its okay to have some predefined speakers IMO to keep the show going, but there should be parallel tracks where people can propose talks or discussions, thus giving everyone an opportunity to share and learn.\n\nLastly, I have tried to stay constructive so that the organizers get an idea about the audience and how they felt at the end of the day. Hopefully, this would result in more interesting and happening events in the future. I\u2019m glad that at-least one of the 8 rules of BarCamp have been followed today (2nd Rule: You do blog about BarCamp.)\n\nPS. this BarCamp was unconventional because conventionally they are supposed to be unconventional, and this one, on the contrary was quite conventional."}

Full freedom, no teachers, bunking classes is regular, going classes is a once in a while thing, friends are family, family is now a phone call away. Yeah, I know howmuch fun college is but on a seious note we should never forget the primary reason we joined the college,\n\nAn Important Issue :\n\nRecently, I was also thinking that why do most of the tech startups or the awesome ideas that totally change the world come from some place on the other side of the globe. If they can why not someone in India? or Nepal? No, it\u2019s really hard to. Why? It\u2019s because the way we are taught, the way colleges run. Colleges are just making the next lot of engineers, they are not making thinkers, not innovators. But, again, it doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t. It\u2019s high time we take a shift of paradigm, try to do some interesting stuff in college, mix it with all the awesome fun we are having.\n\nThat\u2019s all for now.

If we all had to grow our own food, we wouldn\u2019t waste a third of if (as we do now in the UK). If we had to make our own tables and chairs, we wouldn\u2019t throw them out the moment we changed the interior d\u00e9cor. If we could see the look on the face of the child who, under the eyes of an armed soldier, cuts the cloth for the garment we contemplate buying on the high street, we\u2019d probably give it a miss. If we could see the conditions in which a pig is slaughtered, it would put most of us off our bacon butty. If we had to clean our own drinking water, we sure as hell wouldn\u2019t shit in it.\u201d\n\nToday, Friday the\n\nis considered to be the biggest shopping festival of the year, also (in) famously termed as Black Friday. People go out on a limb and buy more stuff than they need, even more stuff than they can consume and even more stuff than they can ever make sense of. Why? Because its cheap and because the rest of the world is also doing it.\n\nToday, Friday the\n\nhas also been very smartly chosen (like every year) as the\n\n. The idea of it is not to stop people from buying on this chosen date, but it is to start understanding about one\u2019s consuming behavior and\n\n. People should start connecting with the things they consume, connecting with the people who make them and try to understand the implications of what they buy and what kind of processes they are giving their money to.\n\nThe Motto is simple \u201c Buy what you need, not what you want. \u201c. Our choices has led us to industrialization, which brought a lot of nice goodies and with all the nice came the bad as well. The world got divided, the poor countries make and the rich countries consume. There is an incentive to have cheap labor in the world. The only way we can make a difference is by being aware of our choices. I find it funny that we have to pay a premium for \u201cfair-trade\u201d and are very comfortable with the default. Shouldn\u2019t it be the other way round, that all products are \u201cfair-trade\u201d by default and the products that have had unfair procedures would be labeled as \u201cunfair-trade\u201d.

It all started back in mid-2013 when my twitter stream and facebook newsfeed was filled with status-es like \u201cIt\u2019s official, you\u2019re invited! Yay!\u201d and there in my mailbox was an unread email with the same subject. Yes, It was official and I was invited too :D. It was an invitation to attend the Mozilla Summit 2013 to be hosted simulatneously in 3 cities (Brussels, Toronto and Santa-Clara) and with the mission for (almost) all mozillians to come together, get inspired, talk and shape the future of the open web.\n\nFast forward to October 2013, after a flight from Munich via Amsterdam, I was standing in front of the Brussles airport, there were the amazing summit volunteers waiting to greet mozillians and make sure we reach the right hotel. I checked into the hotel, went to the square to grab dinner/snacks and the awesome goodie bag. Next stop was the Delirium Cafe (also known for having the guiness world record for the most variety of beer in 2004) where i met a lot of awesome mozillians.\n\nOver the next couple(+1) of days i attended sessions related to privacy on the web (where we discussed about ghostery and collusion- now knows as Lightbeam), using the developer tools to debug other XUL based applications (especially thunderbird), Mozilla Reps program, MDN, OpenBadges, having a million mozillians. One thing that i liked about each session is that it was a two way session and it included more discussions and less of one way communication.\n\nOther than the sessions, I think the world fair and the innovation fair were the two awesome places to be in the summit as it gave one an opportunity to see how spread we are as mozillians and how awesome we are too.\n\nWell, you attended an event - AWESOME, but what you take away from the event decides how successful it was and how it would help you in the coming days. Here\u2019s what i got to takeaway.\n - Getting to know some of the faces behing the IRC nicks, turns out i couldnt\u2019 meet all the faces\n - Meeting the mozillians from Europe. I would like to give a special shout out to Axel Grude (the awesome AMO guru), Raivis (The Latvian mozillian, localizer, webdev, awesome!), Rimas (localizer, techie from Lithuania) and Sjmur (Mozilla ireland community manager).\n - A week after the summit and i had already helped Axel test(and find a bug too) one of his\n\nand made it to his contributor list.\n - Last but not the least, leaving with the motivation to do more and the feeling that your work is making a difference.\n\nAnother mail, another set of flights and here I am in London, Running to the Mozilla office directly from the airport to attend a reps meeting session regarding the Mozilla Festival. Oh, did i say that this was the biggest MozFest till date. This was quite a different event from other Mozilla events, because of the new set of audience and the new set of motivation. The Mozilla Festival is all about building and hacking, as they say (F*ck it, Ship it).\n\nThe first day of the event officially started with the science fair at the evening, leaving us (as facilitators) a whole day to get an idea of the flow of the event and our role in it. Me and Prashish were part a of the scrum led by Kat and Laura, where we had a wall full of problems and an army of awesome-scurm-leads (More on the scrum later). Then we had the hack-your-tshirt session where we hacked our tshirts with spray paint and sketch-pens. The event had a mega version of it with paints and what not (more on that later). Then, kicked off the real deal of the day, the Science festival. There were some awesome projects, experiments and products being displayed but i would like to give a special mention to goolabs (for their awesome work with 3d on the web), Erase all kittens(for how awesome+weird+different their approach to teaching and gaming is) and the tactile web demo from the Mozilla Japan team (believe me they were awesome)\n\nThe Day 2 kicked off with the keynotes and then moving to the track they belonged to. I first went to the #teachTheWeb track, as we were part of that track. There was a beautiful wall of\n\nwaiting to be in the making and be made eventually :D . Then i went to the openbadges section to hack on some custom badges and badges of the future. While browsing other badges i was way inspired by the\n\n. Then came the most important and happening event of the day, the Maker-Party. I am so glad that i didnt miss it, because the aurora and the spirit at the maker party was amazing (more than that). People working on stop-motion-videos, children learning to code, people making games using scratch, making (the so sweet)kumi dolls, and a lot more (there were so many things happening that i might have forgot some). That was most of the first day which ended with some awesome conversations with Henrik, Jan, Prashishh, Michael and Leo over the course of Japanese food.\n\nThe third day was mostly similar with attending more awesome sessions, meeting more awesome people, painting some more t-shirts :P and learning more intriguing ways to teach and engage people.\n\nI think the biggest takeaway from this event was how important learning is and how big a role the teacher/teaching method plays in the process. I personally learned a variety of different ways people were using to teach webmaking and moreover dozens of ways people were using the web to make things. Again, a big shout out to all the Mozilla Reps (you all are awesome), It was a great pleasure meeting each one of you.\n\nWell, I wanted to especially thank the Mozilla Nepal community (especially Avash for taking the lead initially), and the people behind the first Mozilla South Asian Meetup, where i got to meet all the community leaders (especially Deb, who is my mentor too) who eventually guided me and helped me to contribute."}

My method of reading the book has been rather unmethodical. Every couple of days/weeks when I feel like it, I pick up the book and continue reading where i last left off. Sometimes when I come across a strong thought (which happens more often than not in this book), I keep that thought in my mind and try to put it into action over time.\n\nThe following excerpt from the book has had a huge impact on me. I think about it very often and it reminds me of other quotes and sayings that I keep close to myself (and have collected mentally over the years)\n\nLiving life as an artist is a practice.\nYou are either engaging in the practice or you\u2019re not.\n\nIt makes no sense to say you\u2019re not good at it\nIt\u2019s like saying, \u201cI\u2019m not good at beting a monk.\u201d\nYou are either living as a monk or you\u2019re not.\n\nWe tend to think of the artist\u2019s work as the output.\n\nThe real work of the artist is a way of being in the world.\n\nThere is another quote from the Psychologist Alfred Adler that I heard back in 2015 and It has impacted the way I act on this very much. The quote goes as follows\n\n\u201cIt is easier to fight for ones principles than to live up to them.\u201d.\n\nSuch a strong statement. We all have principles, and there are principles that we very often are very strict about in \u201cwords\u201d and stricter when we see other people going against it. But, when it comes to us living by those principles, we very easily defy them and create loopholes for our own convenience. The way this has impacted my is as follows \u2013 In most cases before acting and saying things to people, I think if they are pragmatic or rather principle based. If they are principle based, I tend to not speak them as often as I would in past. These are my principles and as long as someone else is not crossing boundaries, I would allow them to live by theirs and I\u2019d \u201ctry\u201d to live by mine. I don\u2019t want to spend my time \u201cfighting\u201d for my principles. Atleast, I am not here to spread it, I think.\n\nThere is one more quote along similar lines as Rick Rubin. It\u2019s from \u201cThe Tibetian book of living and dying\u201d by Sogyal Rinpoche. I unfortunately don\u2019t recall the exact words from the book, and don\u2019t have a copy to get it from. But, the feeling of the words remain with me \u2013\n\nYou cannot meditate for some time and then be not meditating. That is not how meditation works. Meditation is a way of life.\n\nSpeaking for myself, I tend to think a lot about my principles and topics that I am interested in. And based on that, I try to live my life focusing on those topics, learning about them, acting as I belong to learn about those topics and create something with them. Its not important if the creation changes the world. Its not important if the creation is well known in the world. The only thing that is important is that it changes me. And, it changes me for good. I hope."}

Its raining cats and dogs. Actually, It\u2019s been raining non stop for the last 2 nights. The streets are flooded and the very little traffic that is out this stormy morning is being re-routed in multiple places. I am wondering how today will go.\n\n-\nSeveral of the organizing team reach the venue. We are setting up the venue, but there is a cloud of uncertainity. The rain is not something that we had factored in our planning.\n\n-\nI get a message \u201cAvinash, I believe you should consider cancelling today.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a thought that has already cross our minds. There\u2019s news of flood in several locations of Kathmandu. Several landslides have been reported. But we also had a commitment to everyone who registered. Even if just five people showed up, we felt we owed it to them to keep the show running. And that\u2019s exactly what we were going to do.\n\n- The first group of attendees show up. We were not expecting people to show up on time, let alone at all. This was the first motivation we needed for the day.\n\n-  A few more trickled in, and by now we had around 40 people. Not bad, right? Enough for a party. A BarCamp Party.\n\nBy the end of the day we had:\n\nSome fun facts:\n\nAll in all, I am really happy with the event and how it turned out. We (as wwktm) haven\u2019t had organized an event since covid, so getting back on the \u201corganizing\u201d wheel took quite a lot of effort, But in the end, I think we pulled it off.\n\nFor next time, though, if there\u2019s a BarCamp again [1], we\u2019ll definitely plan earlier and budget better. The ticket prices were kept low this time, and unfortunately, we ended up with a few financial losses. But I\u2019d like to think of it as an investment in future events rather than a loss.\n\n[1] Let me know what you thought about the event. Your feedback helps us improve and motivates us to keep going.\n\nUntil then,\n\nBe nice to everyone :D"}

It fills me with pride looking at how far we have come, and how colorful and eventful (ba-dum-tiss) the community has become. There is an event every week or so, community-leaders are meeting often discussing about maximizing community interaction. The best part of it is that the community also feels that we need to have such events. Now, that\u2019s all Roses, lets talk about the Thorns. I would like to disucss a Thorn in specific.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t even been a week in 2017 and I have had two event invites. YAY! that\u2019s so awesome, right? NO! Why? you may ask. The reason is that I couldn\u2019t attend either of the two events. People were notified a couple of days in advance about the event. I\u2019m really sorry to put this out, even though it should have been obvious, two days prior notice for a meeting/event  is too less of a time. Inviting the community atleast one week in advance should be part of the event etiquette recipe. We are failing at this. It is a collective failure and we should try to fix this.\n\nSo, what can we do about this? I have a proposition especially for dev/tech events.\n\nIf there is a better way of doing this, I am all ears, lets talk in the slack channel."}
{"url": "https://chsmc.org/2023/03/weblogs-as-a-form/", "origin": "https://chasem.co/thoughts/", "title": "How blogs shaped the web | Chase McCoy", "content": "I have a lot of nostalgia for the era of blogging that I grew up with during the first decade or so of the 2000s.\n\nOf course there was a ton of great content about technology and internet culture, but more importantly to me it was a time of great commentary and experimentation on the form of blogging and publishing.\n\nAs social media and smartphones were weaving their ways into our lives, there was a group of bloggers constructing their own worlds. Before Twitter apps and podcast clients became the UI playgrounds of most designers, it was personal sites and weblogs that were pioneering the medium.\n\nLooking back, this is probably where my meta-fascination with the web came from. For me the most interesting part has always been the part analyzing and discussing itself.\n\nRobin Sloan puts it well (as he is wont to do):\n\nBack in the 2000s, a lot of blogs were about blogs, about blogging. If that sounds exhaustingly meta, well, yes\u200a\u2014\u200abut it was also SUPER generative. When the thing can describe itself, when it becomes the natural place to discuss and debate itself, I\u00a0am telling you: some flywheel gets spinning, and powerful things start to\u00a0happen.\n\nDesign, programming, and writing started for me on the web. I can recall the progression from a plain text editor to the Tumblr theme editor to learning self-hosted WordPress.\n\nAll of that was driven by the desire to tinker and experiment with the web\u2019s form. How many ways could you design a simple weblog? What different formats were possible that no one had imagined before?\n\nEarlier this week I listened to\n\nand was delighted to hear them discuss this very topic. Jason is one of the original innovators of the blog form, and I\u2019ve been following his blog, kottke.org, since I was old enough to care about random shit on the internet.\n\n, and Jason has been publishing online for even longer than that. All along the way, he has experimented with the form of content on the web. He\u2019s not alone in that\u2014many bloggers like him have helped to mold the internet into what it is today. The ones that influenced me besides kottke.org are\n\n,\n\n, Jim Coudal and\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n, and more that I\u2019m certainly forgetting.\n\n, and my personal favorite design of the site over the years\n\nJason and John have an interesting conversation during the podcast (starting around 25 minutes in) about how the first few generations of bloggers on the web defined its shape. Moving from print to digital mediums afforded a labyrinth of new avenues to explore.\n\nIt\u2019s always important to remind ourselves that many of the things we take for granted today on the web and in digital design had to be invented by someone.\n\nEarly weblogs did not immediately arrive at the conclusion of chronological streams\u2014some broke content up into \u201cissues\u201d, some simply changed the content of their homepages entirely.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until later that the reverse-chronological, paginated-or-endless scrolling list of entries was introduced and eventually became the de-facto presentation of content on the web. That standard lives on today in the design of Twitter, Instagram, etc., and it\u2019s fascinating to see that tradition fading away as more sites embrace algorithmic feeds.\n\nBy the way, I\u2019d be remiss here if I didn\u2019t mention Amy Hoy\u2019s amazing piece\n\n. Comparing the title of her piece with the title of this one, it\u2019s clear that not everyone sees this shift in form as a positive one, but she does a great job in outlining the history and the role that blogs played in shaping the form of the web. Her particular focus on early content management systems like Movable Type is fascinating.\n\nAnother great example that Jason and John discuss on the podcast is the idea of titling blog posts.\n\nThey point out that many early sites didn\u2019t use titles for blog posts, a pattern which resembles the future form of Tweets, Facebook posts, text messages, and more. But the rise of RSS readers, many of which made the assumption that entries have titles and design their UIs around that, forced many bloggers to add titles to their posts to work well in the environment so popular with their readers.\n\nJason mentions that this was one of the driving factor for kottke.org to start adding titles to posts!\n\nThis is an incredible example of the medium shaping the message, where the UI design of RSS readers heavily influenced the form of content being published. When optimizing for the web, those early bloggers and the social networks of today both arrived at the same conclusion\u2014titles are unnecessary and add an undue burden to publishing content.\n\nThis difference is the very reason why sending an email feels heavier than sending a tweet. Bloggers not using titles on their blog posts figured out tweeting long before Twitter did.\n\nWhen referring to the early bloggers at suck.com, Jason said something that I think describes this entire revolution pretty well.\n\n[\u2026]there was in information to be gotten from not only what they linked to, but how they linked to it, which word they decided to make the hyperlink.\n\nIt\u2019s not often that you have an entirely new stylistic primitive added to your writing toolbox. For decades you could bold, italicize, underline, uppercase, footnote, etc. and all of a sudden something entirely new\u2014the hyperlink.\n\nWith linking out to other sites being such a core part of blogging, it\u2019s no surprise that the interaction design of linking was largely discussed and experimented with.\n\ndiscussing all the ways that various blogs of the time handled posts primary geared towards linking to and commenting on other sites.\n\nAnother similar example is URL slugs\u2014the short string of text at the end of a web address identifying a single post. For many of my favorite bloggers, the URL slug is a small but subtle way to convey a message that may\n\nthe same as the message of the post itself. One other stylistic primitive unique to the web.\n\nThe different ways in which bloggers designed their site or linked to words became a part of their unique style, and it gave their each of them an entirely new way to express themselves.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to communicate how grateful I feel for this era of experimentation on the web, and specifically for Jason Kottke\u2019s influence on me as a designer. The past 25 years have been a special time to experience the internet.\n\nThere was a time when I thought my career might be curved towards blogging full-time and running my own version of something like kottke.org. Through exploring that I found my way to what I really loved\u2014design and software. My work continues to benefit from what I learned studying bloggers and publishers online.\n\nWhether you care much about writing or not, I encourage you to have a blog. Write about what interests you, take great care of how you present it to the world, and you might be surprised where it takes you. There are new forms around every corner."}

I\u2019ve returned from holiday travels and am settling back into work for 2025. Here are three, quick, bookish recommendations from links that have crossed my desk recently.\n\nFirst, a newsletter: Katie Clapham\u2019s\n\nis a new favorite of mine.\n\nKatie runs an independent bookshop in Lancashire, and every Friday when she opens the shop she also starts a new draft of the newsletter. Throughout the day she fills it up with commentary on running a bookshop in these modern times, quips from the shoppers, witty observations, a record of books sold and purchased, etc. At the end of the day, she closes the shop and sends the newsletter.\n\nOne of my favorite genres of art is \u201ctotally mundane but fascinating and engaging for reasons that are hard to explain,\u201d and Receipt from the Bookshop fits that bill perfectly.\n\nMore than just being fascinating, though, it\u2019s a good reminder for us all how creativity and fulfillment as a writer\n\ncome from mundanity. There is beauty in the mundane! We can find it if we look hard enough.\n\nWhatever this is: more of it please.\n\nBooks are powerful cultural artifacts, and so much of human history is wound around them. It should be no surprise then that notebooks carry a similar significance.\n\nWell that\u2019s just what Roland Allen\u2019s book,\n\n, is all about. I picked it up recently after seeing it recommended by a few folks in their 2024 reading recaps.\n\nThe cast of historical characters that pop up throughout the book is a lot of fun, and the author does a great job of showing just how critical notebooks were to the development of civilization and culture as we know it today.\n\nAnother truly great example of something unassuming (notebooks) being explored with a contagious enthusiasm. There is, repeatedly, poetry in the mundane.\n\nBy the way, I love reading books which tell history non-linearly through the lens of ultra-niche subtopics. Another great example that comes to mind is\n\nby James Crawford. Books and buildings both make great portals back in time.\n\nFinally, a celebration of the book collectors, dealers, sellers, and conservators who preserve the art of books and bring the most important ones along into the future.\n\nWhile reading The Notebook: A History, I stumbled upon a 2019 documentary that resonated on the same frequency.\n\n, which (from what I can tell) has recently been made\n\n, focuses primarily on rare book dealers in New York City and their bookshops, and it\u2019s a visual feast for book lovers. But more importantly it\u2019s an homage to those still dedicating their lives to preserving the written word and the book as a form.\n\nThere\u2019s a clear and present danger to the world of books that is felt palpably in the documentary, with many sellers and collectors worried about a diminishing market for book collectors. There are also those in the film who see a bright future. It\u2019s nice to hear both takes.\n\nAs for myself, I am a huge fan of collecting physical books, and maintain a\n\nwhich you can browse if you\u2019d like. Whether you collect books or not, I recommend giving The Booksellers a watch."}

In a recent\n\n, we discussed computer science degrees, bootcamps, and self-directed learning. Each has benefits and have brought a lot of people into the world of programming. Each also has challenges. All four of us have had unique paths to programming, so here are our stories.\n\nI was a biology major in college and then quickly realized that I was terrible at it. So, I switched to actuarial science where I took an intro to computer science course and totally fell in love with binary, hexadecimal, and octal systems. The rest is really history. I studied computer science and my first language was Java. I was a little bit of a late bloomer but I thoroughly enjoy it.\n\nI got started when I was 11 years old. I wanted to build my own community on Neopets. If you\u2019re not familiar with what Neopets is, it\u2019s this Web site where you can have your own virtual pet and you can feed it and play games. You can have your own communities and all kinds of stuff.\n\nI really wanted to build my own community and customize it. But you need to know how to code to do that. So, I asked my dad for an HTML book and my first book was HTML goodies. I thought it was awesome and a lot of fun.\n\nFast forward to high school, and I took AP Computer Science. My first language in high school was Java, and I was so bad at it that I needed a tutor just to pass the class. I was like \"I\u2019m never going to do this ever.\" But, you know, obviously, 17 years later and I\u2019m very clearly still coding, so something eventually clicked but it wasn\u2019t Java.\n\nI was an admin assistant really aimlessly going through my job; I was miserable. My dad suggested coding to me and was like \"worst case scenario if you hate it you could try something else.\"\n\nSo, he bought me an \u201dIntroduction to Drupal\u201d book and \u2013 quite frankly, I do not recommend starting out as Drupal when you\u2019re learning to code but that\u2019s how I did. I just continue learning, continue working in the mornings before work. Then I got my first Drupal job.\n\nA few years into that I started learning about accessibility. Then a year or so after that I started learning about React and VueJS and I\u2019m now a React developer and the rest is kind of history.\n\nI learned to code when I was a sophomore in college. I had no idea what coding even was, but I had an extra course block available. I decided to sign up for it because people kept telling me, \u201dIt\u2019s a good thing to learn and it\u2019ll help you no matter what.\u201d\n\nI honestly thought that I was going to be learning how to format Word documents or something like that - I had no idea what code was. But, I was instead writing Python. It was super fun: we were building games. I just thought it was magical how you could put stuff together and have a program come out of it.\n\nI completely reconfigured my schedule and was like I\u2019m going to double major in computer science, this is my future. So, I started my second class which was in C++ and it was a super intense \"Data Structures and Algorithms\" class, which was also a weed out class. I was pulling all-nighters and working so hard in that class just to understand it. I did come out of it with a good grade. I thought \"if I have to work this hard for it, it means that I\u2019m not good enough at it. This is really just not for me.\"\n\nThen when I was a Junior in college I had an internship doing mostly Excel data analysis type work, and I figured out that I could automate a lot of my own job using the Python skills that I had. So, from there, I got a software engineering internship and transitioned to working full time in code.\n\nYou can listen to the\n\nwhere we discussed our thoughts on bootcamps, computer science degrees, and self-directed learning as well as advice for everyone in the midst of their journies.\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nI love origin stories!\n\nI think the major takeaway is that it doesn't matter how you get started - just get started, and keep going.  Each of your backgrounds is so different; it's a testament to the fact that there is no one 'right' way to get started.  Just find something you like doing - and keep doing that.\n\nThanks for sharing!\n\nI love hearing \"where did you fell in love with computers\" stories \ud83e\udd29\n\nKeep rocking!\n\nLoved Lindsey\u2019s story, my first job was as a Drupal developer!

{"url": "https://dev.to/aspittel/working-remote-for-those-who-struggle-with-it-4g35", "origin": "https://dev.to/aspittel", "title": "Working Remote for Those Who Struggle with It - DEV Community", "content": "Posted on\n\n\u2022 Originally published at\n\non\n\nI have been\n\nabout the fact that remote work is very difficult for me. I'm an extrovert, and the social environment at work helps to motivate me and get me through the day. That being said, due to COVID and the evolving nature of tech work, I've been working remote for almost two years. There are a lot of benefits to it, like no commute time, the ability to live wherever, more flexibility, and accessibility. Also, I know it's a huge privilege to be able to work remote during this time, and so few of my non-tech friends have that ability. But, for me, working remote doesn't come naturally. So, I wanted to write down my strategies for making it as enjoyable as possible.\n\nI also want to note before starting that right now many of us are working through the stress of a pandemic, shifting to new modalities at work, struggling with economic instability and unemployment, shifting childcare responsibilities, and dealing with health concerns for ourselves and our families. None of this is normal, make sure to take time for yourself and it's okay to not be okay.\n\nThis may sound super corny, but mentally having some sort of \"commute\" to work in the morning and after work in the evening creates some separation in your day. I have a dog, which makes this even easier -- I walk her at the beginning of the day before work and then take her to the park at the end of the day. I also have time to sneak in a bit of a podcast or an audiobook too.\n\nWhen I started working remote, I lived alone. It made work from home really hard because if I didn't actively make plans, I could go days without talking to another human. Earlier this year, I moved in with my partner. Now, I am guaranteed to talk to someone pretty much every day, and I feel much less isolated.\n\nEven if living with another person isn't a reality, having a pet really helps. Having Blair, my dog, makes me get out of the house, and I still have someone with me all day, even if she isn't human. I get cuddles during my breaks, and I even sometimes get a ball thrown at me!\n\nWhen I started working remote, I lived in an apartment that had essentially been my crash pad before. It was in a perfect location, but wasn't very large and was very old -- it didn't even have a real kitchen! I worked out of a desk in my bedroom. So, I was pretty much in that room for 22+ hours a day. It wasn't great for me mentally to not have a separate workspace, and there wasn't much separation between my work and the rest of my life. I know it isn't realistic for everyone, especially those with families or who live in cities with high rent and low square footage, but having a dedicated workspace that you can close off at the end of the day is\n\nand helps you really separate work and the rest of your life.\n\nEarlier this year when the pandemic hit, I lived in a very old studio apartment in NYC, and while it was in the perfect location, it also had a horrible mouse problem, the temperature was always off, and I was pretty much in the same room 24 hours a day. It was miserable.\n\nMoving out of that environment has made working from home much more bearable. Especially since my company has a work from home budget. Getting a comfortable chair, a monitor setup that works for me, and customizations that fit my personality make my workday so much more enjoyable. It has also become a lot more important for me to live in a nice space, and instead of prioritizing living close to work or right downtown, I'm more concerned with living somewhere that's updated, doesn't have a lot of issues, and has space to move around.\n\nEven though I think it's really helpful to have a dedicated workspace, I also move throughout my apartment throughout the day. I do a few hours of work at my desk, then take calls from the couch or the dining room table if I don't need a monitor. It's nice to change the scenery and have a different chair at some point in the day. It helps me re-focus as the day goes on.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of working in an office is the ability to grab or eat lunch with work friends each day. Something I do at least once a week is schedule a lunchtime video call with a friend, whether they are inside of my company or external. It really breaks up the day, recharges me, and keeps those connections intact.\n\nOne of the really nice parts of working remote is that other than calls, you can normally schedule your day to fit your schedule and how you work best rather than being standardized to a 9-5. I often read the advice to always get ready for work. I instead normally put on makeup and get dressed nicely mid-day when I don't have early meetings. I also sometimes take runs during my lunch break, and I often work a 7-3 or 8-4 day instead of 9-5. Use the flexibility to your advantage and work a schedule that fits your needs.\n\nThis is much less relevant now since there's a pandemic going on, but I think it's so important to still socialize with friends and do things outside of your house. It can be tempting to become a hermit since you have to actively leave your house to do things after work, but you still need social interaction and to experience life outside your living space. I find making plans with friends makes me more accountable and likely to do things. Even now, setting up virtual or park hangouts adds some variety to the day!\n\nThis is, again, more of a post-pandemic recommendation, but before COVID I used to do co-working days with friends who also work remote. I would either have them over, or we would meet at a coffee shop and we would work together on each of our work tasks. It's a great opportunity to catch up and have the opportunity to have someone to chat with throughout the day.\n\nOne of the things I miss most about working in an office is unstructured discussion time with colleagues. Most remote calls have a structure and an agenda, but so much valuable brainstorming comes from free-flowing discussions. On past teams, we've scheduled watercooler time or virtual team happy hours, and it's been great to get to know one another and come up with ideas.\n\nEven though most things are remote now, having a community who understands what you do and who you can learn from is so important. I love so many Discord and Slack groups in addition to public forums like DEV and Twitter. They allow me to stay involved with the larger developer community.\n\nRemote work is an increasing piece of work in tech, and I know that it's a really amazing thing for a lot of people, especially parents and those who are disabled. There are many nice pieces of it, like being able to live wherever, no commute times, and the flexibility. That being said, the decrease in work/life separation and the decrease in social time also makes it difficult. Also, this year we aren't just working remote, we are working during a pandemic -- and many people have additional responsibilities as a result. I hope these tips are helpful!\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nI think it's a very important article! Not everyone will be naturally prone to working remote. One thing I have been thinking about lately is how to foster a remote company culture that is actually fun to work in? Remote video calls are good but there's no substitute for face to face interactions (yet). In the remote community there's been so much focus on co-workers who don't like each other and they are forced into an office, watercooler drama, etc. but what about if the co-workers are kickass and it's a genuine fun experience to interact.\n\nalso I was wondering: how to make remote video lunches not turn into some kind of weird live ASMR session ? \ud83e\udd23\n\nYeah I guess everything has pros and cons. Personally I like remote work, even before everyone was forced to. So I already made sure my work space is very nice.\n\nI think it's important to be disciplined and be good at planning if you work from home, otherwise there is no routine and boundaries. Also, for parents I think it's extra challenge, especially if they have limited space. But perhaps WFH also allows people to move to suburb or smaller and less expensive city/town, so they can actually afford better living standard.\n\nAnyone have a link to that wallpaper \ud83d\udc40\n\nYes!\n\nThank you!! \ud83d\udc95\n\nExcellent advice. I've done a lot of these same things for most of my career (which has been 95% WFH self-employment).\n\nI will add, I suggest finding a group of friends that can do social time on video calls of some kind. I've been seriously considering an early morning \"Coffe with Seth\" type stuff to give other early birds like me someone to chit chat with about work stuff, or to just shoot the breeze at a regularly scheduled time.\n\nI've actually found myself really engaged with streamers when I never was before. That can be a lot of fun to find a small streamer and get to interact with whatever they are doing. I enjoy being helpful when I can.\n\nThanks for this post! Although I am not an extrovert, I\u2019m way on the opposite end it is important to be mindful of how we are spending our days now. It\u2019s been a real balance trying to make sure I stay healthy mentally and not fall into becoming a hermit. I have resorted to forming a pod with basically my partner and housemates and that has been super helpful to stay active.\n\nis that 13\" mac comfortable to work for you? I previously tried to work on it on a previous job, but without an external monitor it was horrible, such a small screen to work. Never considered a 16\" instead of this one? Or mobility is your top priority there?\n\nGreat post Ali\n\nThanks for this!! Having a separate place to work and pets really help\n\nYES, I agree with all those great ideas.\n\nMy FAV; Get out of the house! Feeling pent up? For people with yards or front porches, just sit outside for 5 minutes. Get that Vitamin D!\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

You will not be fully productive if you don't take breaks, don't get enough sleep, or you don't take care of yourself. I do not work all the time whatsoever. I work a very standard 40 hour work week and then do 10-20 hours of side work per week. I do not do it all, I don't work non-stop, I'm not perfect.\n\nI also have a life that allows me to dedicate a lot to my side-work. I live with just my dog, I don't have children, I've been working remote for the last year and a half, and I've been single for most of my time doing side-work. I also am at a place in my career where putting in a 40 hour workweek most weeks at my day job is sufficient. It's a huge privilege that I'm able to be in the position that I am, and I know that my life will shift a lot in the future.\n\nEarly in my career, I worked a lot more than I do now -- I don't even want to do the math on how much, but it was a lot. I didn't have much balance in my life, and I let my social media-life consume me. I wanted to do it all, which wasn't possible. I ended up getting super burnt out, anxious, and unable to be as productive as I wanted to be. Balance is\n\nimportant. I can't overstate that enough. If you're dealing with burnout,\n\nwas a super helpful read to see how bad burnout can really become and how to be more balanced.\n\nI highly prioritize time with friends and family, runs with my dog, reading non-work related books, and being a total foodie in addition to my day job and the company I run. I am more than my work, and I don't want to lose my other identities.\n\nHere are some things that I've learned that help me be my most productive. This will look different for everybody, but I hope some of this is helpful.\n\nFirst off, take care of yourself. Sleeping the optimal amount for you will make you more alert and focused throughout the day. The same thing is true for drinking enough water. I also try to eat protein, fat, and carb balanced meals frequently throughout the day. I run most days and try to do other strength-based workouts too. Plus, I take a spa night on Sundays where I do face and hair masks and teeth whitening.\n\nDon't take health advice from me -- it's not what I do. Still, I do think prioritizing your health is one of the most important things you can do for your productivity and overall well-being.\n\nAs far as scheduling goes, I live by my Google Calendars. I put everything on there - I'm the person that sends my friends GCal invites for every hangout session. Otherwise, I'll forget. It's as simple as that.\n\nI have three calendars, one for my personal life, one for We Learn Code (my company), and one for my day job. Sometimes, I'll forward events to my personal calendar, so they're all in one place. If I'm super overwhelmed, I'll calendar block everything. So, I will have every minute of my day, even free time scheduled in. I don't do this often now, but it used to be really helpful for me to see my schedule upfront.\n\nNote: this was a week where I was in between jobs and had a lot I wanted to get done. I was also on vacation for the second half of the week.\n\nIn order to prioritize what I am going to work on, I first ask myself if it's something I'm passionate about. If it is, then I think about the time commitment and what I\n\nbe able to do if I decided to take on the new task. So, if I were to pick up a new freelance client, I would have to postpone working on an ebook, for example.\n\nMy greater goals and priorities have shifted over time. I initially wanted to build a bigger audience, and the activities I took on were correlated to that. Now, my financial situation has changed a bit, and I rely on my side-work being a larger portion of my income. In the future, I may prioritize more free time, which will change things again!\n\nTo help me prioritize, I use\n\nto track my time spent on every project I do -- not just paid ones. I'm even timing myself writing this post right now. I do this so that I can see where my time goes, which inefficiencies exist, and the payoff of each activity.\n\nFor example, here's my Toggl report for the week I'm writing this. Each of my projects is color-coded, and different views show my hours worked per day and listings of each activity by time.\n\nI also ask myself, \"What are the three most important things for me to get done?\". For my side work, I have three big to-do items for the week. For my day job, I do three per day. I use a pinned Google Keep sticky to keep track of these things, and I have another sticky with any time-sensitive tasks I need to do that day. Mostly things that won't take long, but need to get done then and there. Having just a few essential things to work on helps me to stay focused. I try to only work on what I've set out to do at the beginning of the week. I'm pretty dedicated to getting these few tasks done and worry a lot less about everything else.\n\nI read the book\n\nrecently. It got pretty repetitive at some points, but it does a great job at explaining how to prioritize and why prioritization matters so much. Just do what's essential, nothing more nothing less.\n\nAlso, I do not do it all myself. If there's something that makes sense for me to have someone else do, I will hire a service to handle those tasks. I do wash and fold for my laundry, I used to hire a cleaning service for my apartment, and a large portion of my diet is take-out. I'm in a privileged position to be able to outsource some of these pieces of my life, but it allows me to do more of the work that fires me up: teaching code.\n\nMotivation is also a challenging piece of doing side work, and I'm so imperfect at always being motivated. I give myself lots of breaks, and I remind myself that this I'm choosing to do. I do have some advice for getting and staying motivated.\n\nFirst, I love having groups of friends that I \"mastermind\" with. We inspire each other with our work, commiserate over the hard parts, and discuss strategies for growth. I love working with other people, and working on projects with other people or at least talking to them about those projects is a huge source of motivation for me.\n\nI also utilize the two-minute rule -- if something takes two minutes or less, I just have to get it done. Having one thing crossed off of my to-do list starts the ball rolling, and I usually get more done.\n\nSometimes, I set a timer and timebox how long I'll spend on something -- \"I don't feel like writing right now, but if I spend five minutes on it, I'll be closer to where I want to be.\" I rarely want to stop at the end of those five minutes, but it's a great trick for getting me started on something.\n\nI also am really motivated by finishing things -- leaving them half-done really bothers me. So I usually break tasks into smaller and smaller sub-tasks and focus on completing sub-tasks. This makes me feel more accomplished and like I'm making progress, so I'll be much less likely to abandon the project.\n\nOne of the most difficult things to handle when my social media following grew was the non-stop messages. From people requesting advice to spam to lovely comments about my work, I was all the sudden getting hundreds of communications a day. I receive, on average, 100 mentions on Twitter a day, 15-20 Twitter direct messages, and 50-70 emails. It's a lot.\n\nAt first, I would respond to everything. With a lot of thought and care -- essentially writing personalized blog posts for anyone who asked me a question. It wasn't scalable. I still feel some guilt, but I don't respond to everything anymore. I have so much content that's open to the public, which scales so much better than offering 1:1 advice. I also mute my own tweets after a little while if they get a lot of attention, and I have filters so I don't get any notifications from social media. I do, however, have Tweetdeck set up to show me all mentions and quote tweets so that I can quickly mass respond to people.\n\nI also have a system for my emails. I have three folders in my inboxes: today, this week, and this month. When an email comes in, I delete it or put it in one of these folders. I respond to\n\nemails every weekday,\n\nemails on Mondays, and\n\nemails at the end of the month. I also add emails that will take some time to my to-do list so that I can allot that time better. I'm also really interested in implementing\n\nemail system down the road. It seems awesome, it just takes some time to get used to.\n\nI take notes on\n\n. I take short-term notes that I won't keep forever in\n\n. Then I can archive stickies when I'm done with them. If they're something I want long term, I take notes in markdown and upload them to GitHub. I take notes during meetings I'm in, on books I read, on courses I take, etc. It's good for learning, and it gives me a synthesized version of the material to come back to.\n\nIf I have an idea for a project or a blog post, I write that thought down, otherwise, I'll forget it. I even have a notebook next to my bed for this reason!\n\nRelated to notes, I also have checklists for everything I do -- for blog posts before I publish, for recording Egghead videos, for my morning and evening routines, etc. Making a checklist makes it so I don't have to think, I can refer to the list. I am not very detail-oriented, so having the steps for something written out is so helpful, so I don't forget anything.\n\nMy morning and evening routines are all written in large text on a\n\non my fridge -- even just brushing my teeth is on there! I have my weekly workout schedule and chores list on there too.\n\nFor large projects, I usually use Trello to stay organized and motivated. I'll have checklists for each sub-task on each card. Breaking an enormous task into smaller ones helps me keep motivated and feel like I'm making progress.\n\nI've heard great things about\n\n, a book all about keeping checklists for everything. I haven't read the full text, but reading a summary of it inspired me to start creating these checklists.\n\nIf I can convince you to do one thing after reading this article, it would be to pick up\n\n. This book changed so much for me. Instead of focusing on goals, I try and focus on building up habits that make me who I want to become.\n\nI use\n\nhabit-tracker to keep track of habits I'm trying to build. Some things I have on there include: reading a chapter of a career-focused book each day, drinking enough water, and cleaning my apartment for at least 5 minutes. There's the immediate reward of having the habit change colors after it's completed, and there's an incentive to keep the habit chain going!\n\nAs far as file management goes, I keep everything on Google Drive. That way, if my laptop dies or something, I'll still have a backup. I also only keep files I'm using frequently on my computer to keep that organized. I have folders for projects and for life stuff! I also try to keep my personal and We Learn Code drives separate. Gotta keep work/side-hustle/life balance!\n\nI also keep my browser bookmarks super organized in folders. I only keep things I need, otherwise, I'll save links elsewhere -- like Pinterest or in my notes about something. Bookmarks are for links I frequently come back to. I also have a\n\nfolder filled with articles that I want to read. I try to allocate some time to get through these from time to time too!\n\nI think the term work-life balance is imperfect, but I work to make sure that I'm not working all the time. I'm someone who very much has a tendency to work a huge number of hours and to abandon other aspects of my life and health to do more work. This isn't good, and I actively work to not do this, especially since I have been much more prone to burnout recently.\n\nFirst of all, I don't have work email or Slack on my phone. I only have them on my work computer, which I don't touch outside of work hours.\n\nI also try to make my bedroom a technology-free zone. I will say this is\n\neasier when I'm not working from home -- quarantine has made this pretty much impossible. But, I find I sleep so much better if I put my phone and my computer in my living room before I sleep. I also think having dedicated workspaces when you do work from home is so helpful, and it's something I wish that I could more fully implement in my own life (darn city rent prices!).\n\nI am someone who works best without interruption and with long blocks of time. I don't do well with random 15-minute slots to work, rather I'd prefer to have one long afternoon to work. I used to do all of my blogging from the same restaurant in DC, Busboys and Poets. I'd go there every Sunday afternoon and crank out a post. Having that routine and that long block of time was perfect for me.\n\nI also work best in the afternoon as compared to mornings or nights, though in college, late nights were my everything. I usually do side work immediately after my normal workday ends and on weekend afternoons. Everyone is going to be so different with this -- experiment and find times that work best for you!\n\nI know that the\n\ntechnique works really well for some people, but I work best in long focused blocks. I tend to follow the\n\ninstead. I take breaks when I need to or when I finish a task, but frequent breaks aren't helpful for me, nor do I need them.\n\nSometimes, I have a tendency to get distracted. Especially by social media and the internet more generally. During times like that, I'll use the\n\napp to avoid distracting sites. Sometimes I'll even shut off the internet in my apartment if I really want to get some writing done.\n\nOne additional productivity system I find super helpful is batching. Batching is when you do a bunch of similar activities at once. So, for example, when I did Instagram I would write all my captions for the month at one time, and I'd pre-create graphics and find images. Or when I'm filming videos, I'll do multiple at once. When you're in one headspace it can be optimal to keep doing similar tasks instead of changing your focus to something else.\n\nhas some excellent content on why batching is so great.\n\nMy productivity system is just that --\n\nsystem. Don't feel like you need to adopt all of this or follow any of it. I just hope it's helpful to have a peek into my life and the things that help me. Remember -- balance is\n\nimportant and looks different for everyone. I'm so far from perfect, and I think it can seem like I do so much more than I actually do on social media. I am also in a place in my life where I can spend time on side-work, and I love doing it.

I recently started using it and loved it!\n\nsomeone with my style of productivity! Techniques like Pomodoro never made sense to me; I tend to zone into an activity for hours at a time before needing a break. I've been in a quarantine-induced rut lately, so something like Toggl and the \"Flowtime\" technique should definitely help with visualizing my todos day-to-day.\n\nA lot of gems in here. Bookmarking in case I need motivation in the future \ud83d\ude01\n\nVery cool your publication. I really liked Google Keep, it will help me a lot in the division between my school studies and computer technician studies and with my remote repository on GitHub, because sometimes I get very excited, I start coding at 8 am and I stop just for lunch, so I start again and so on until 4 in the morning. I completely forget that I need to study for the entrance exam to enter a university.\n\nI like your thoughts about concentration, reminds me of\n\nprinciples you can find in Cal Newport\u2019s book. I\u2019m just\n\nabout improving as a developer, and I put a big focus on productivity, with one chapter dedicated to deep work :)\n\nGreat article! It seems that you have been working on yourself for a long time and also observing and analyzing all the records and documents too. Just a guess though! I loved many short, sweet, straight but very effective sentences like whatever you have said in the very first paragraph and in the conclusion. Thanks for sharing what has worked for you! Kudos to your efforts... Have a productive day ahead... Keep shining, Keep inspiring \ud83d\ude03\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf8a\n\nHey guys, I have been working on my very first APIs project and in that project I'm making a \"QUIZ APP\", where from an API. I have been taking 10 question and giving them multiple choices and at end they will be getting scored. I'm using NODE.JS, EXPRESS, REQUEST, EJS for the app.\n\nThe problem comes here when i get a string from API. I change it to an object using JSON.parse() and sending it to EJS files and then displayed. but when their are symbols in question like \", ' , and more they are displayed as &139; , \" like that.\n\nAlways interesting to read others' routines. I've recently added kaizen to my workflow, meaning that I look for a small step to improve a process every day. It had the most impact on my personal life so far. For example, yesterday I improved the way I prepare avocado for eating (there's a better way to deal with kernels than what I had been doing). I got the ideas from\n\n.\n\nAnother tool that I use in a similar way to the flowtime technique is RescueTime checking the report from time to time to see in which categories I was working on and how the time was spent.\n\nI have tried Pomodoro technique and I am on the same page as you that I don't need breaks too often. Will try to understand what is Flowtime, thanks for sharing this \ud83d\udc4d\n\nnote taking and scheduling has always seemed as a work itself...\n\ni guess it takes practice to implement it as a daily habit :)\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

I have no concerns over present air quality.\n\nLol, good one. Congrats by the way!\n\nHey Jason,\n\ncongrats!\n\nHow did you learn writing?\n\nI've been coming up with stories my whole life, growing up in literary circles, as my mother is an author and editor. So, as you can imagine, I read a\n\nof books, both with my mother and on my own. (I read through the complete unabridged Wizard of Oz series by myself in one summer when I was six.)\n\nI joined my first professional critique group when I was eight; I was told I'd be welcome to join, but they'd expect me to accept the same unvarnished feedback that any grown-up member would get, and to read their work and provide the same sort of honest feedback. So, I did.\n\nWhen writing professionally, you really learn that nothing you write is sacred. Even the sentence you think is the\n\nbrilliant, or the quote you think must surely be worthy of Bartlett's Quotations, might actually need to get cut from the book. Most people are okay coming up with words; the art of writing is largely in\n\nof words.\n\nFrom there, I just kept writing, participating in critique groups and countless writing workshops, and honing my craft.\n\nCongrats!!\n\nI am proud of creating JSitor, which is an alternative of JSFiddle, JSBin and CodePen.\n\nI won't say that JSitor will be the best tool but definitely it is worth to explore.

I've had scoliosis and kyphosis, and I was a year or two away from needing surgery to fix it.\n\nMy girlfriend motivated me to get a personal trainer specialized in posture, and after 7 months of regular exercises and progress tracking, I'm almost finished in fixing my posture. Exercises were simple and very effective and I didn't need to buy anything to perform them. And I also could do them at home. Each month I would get a new set of exercises targeting different areas of the body that were needed to correct the posture.\n\nSo I also want to encourage anyone else that has issues with posture to seek help and try to fix it before it gets worse. Posture exercises are great and you'll feel much better after a month or two of regular exercises.\n\nI started my\n\n24 days ago and wrote on 23 days, with only one failed day and no safety-net.\n\nI've done a blogging challenge as well!

I was at a job that wasn't the right fit for me, and I didn't know my future. I decided that rather than signing a new lease, I'd instead mostly live at tech conferences for the summer and crash at my parents' in between, and then start living out of AirBnBs in the Fall. I ended up retiring from the digital nomad lifestyle in order to work in an office gain (which started 3 days before the COVID shutdown \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f). That being said, I think this is a pretty unique experience, but more people may be able to do the same as remote work becomes more popular and (hopefully) the pandemic starts to subside. So, I wanted to write down my thoughts and advice on the experience.\n\nI personally chose to live out of AirBnBs. The longer you book a place, the more discount you get normally. So, I'd book a place for a month at a time. The cost for AirBnB pluses ended up being less than my DC rent most months. The van life idea is so appealing to me, but the mechanical knowledge needed and the potential lack of internet intimidates me. I also personally stayed in the United States because of my dog, I didn't want to quarantine her which you need to do with most international countries.\n\nI travelled from city to city in my car, which was super nice. I was able to visit a bunch of sites nearby cities instead of just staying downtown, which I may have had to without a car.\n\nI chose cities by expense, activities available, and their proximity to National Parks. My biggest bucket list item is to visit all of the National Parks, so this very much helped in that goal. I loved being able to experience different areas, taste test different restaurants, and to never get bored of my surroundings. I also was using it as a way to vet cities before settling down -- I didn't know where I wanted to move longterm, so this was a way of trying out different cities.\n\nTaxes can get\n\ncomplicated if you're moving around a bunch, especially if you move internationally or are self-employed (or just have side gigs like me). I hired an accountant who specializes in digital nomads, and it's such a weight off my chest.\n\nis his site in case you're interested.\n\nThere were two really difficult attributes of travel for me: the first was loneliness, the second was the lack of a routine. It's pretty tough to get to know people when you aren't staying in a city for long. Something I would probably prioritize if I did this again would be to go to cities with a big tech scene so I could go to meetups and potentially speak at them. I was also single at the time, so doing this with a partner or a family would probably help in that regard. As far as having a routine, I was changing where I lived every month. So it's difficult to get too settled. Part of that was nice, I would go on hikes every morning with my dog in Asheville and would go to a neighborhood coffee shop in Nashville. But, I definitely missed having a set workday schedule.\n\nOverall, it's an experience I really enjoyed and would highly recommend if your work and life situations allow it. I would probably go back to being a digital nomad once the country re-opens and my partner was able to work remote. If you're interested in moving internationally,\n\nthis Ladybug episode. Please\n\nany questions to me, I'd love to help out!\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nThis is exactly what I would like to do but kinda afraid to take the plunge. I too had a plan to visit different cities and just go to tech conferences and meetups but I\u2019m unsure if I should without a car and use public transport or not. Also I am a freelancer so it\u2019s feast or famine when it comes to money.\n\nCosmic timing Ali ! I\u2019m about to do this my self.. I\u2019ve been at a job that allows me to do this for about a year now , and my lease is up in July , so as soon as it is , I want to sell all my stuff and do it while I\u2019m still single and not having kids\n\nThank you so much for the heads up , in regards to loneliness and lack of routing - being a creature of habit I think I too would seriously miss this aspect Of everyday existence the most  ...\n\nPerHaps if I stayed longer than a month , like at least 3 at a time , it would enough to feel settled in .\n\nAnd to combat loneliness - I am pretty violently extroverted and usually end up making friends wherever I go .. just difficult when they don\u2019t speak English .\n\nAwesome! Yeah, hopefully by then things will be more open and you can go to events. I think that will be really helpful :)\n\nReally cool to share this experience! I would love to do something similar in Europe but am always a bit scared about the lack of routine and how hard would it be to meet people and build relationships in short term.\n\nThis post inspired me though! Thank you\n\nWhat if you are planning this in the country where you live right now.?\n\nI would be less scared if I plan it \"smaller\".\n\nAnd probably you already will get some good experience and confidence to do it in the whole Europe.\n\nThat is also a valid idea :) I am living in Austria currently, so small country if compared to where I come from, but still there are other cities where would be cool to live for a while!\n\nNeat! Thanks for sharing, especially the accountant bit!\n\nWe plan to launch in 2023. I joined a community called\n\nlast year, and I'll be keeping my membership up until the big day because there is just so much to learn! There are people in this community that do it with AirBnB like you. One of the other benefits is the private small groups in the community, such as the one for IT Professionals.\n\nStarlink will be in full swing by then, so hopefully we'll be more connected than ever so that we can be more disconnected than ever. Wrap your mind around that!\n\nOne of the things you said really stood out to me, and that was your comment about DC rent. In Annapolis we are are shelling out $3,700 a month between childcare and rent, and I didn't know how well that would prepare me for places like Norway which famously costs you about $25-35 dollars for fish and chips and a pint. Cool, we do that, too!\n\nIt comes up a lot in the group, because there is someone experiencing the digital nomad life at every level from financially independent to the most frugal families you've ever met. The first question I asked was whether or not I was ridiculous for wanting a 5th wheel for the three of us when there are people cramming 12 into a vintage Airstream, and I found that it's all about what is comfortable for you. It set me at ease. This is going to be our home for a few years while we are roadschooling/unschooling, after all.\n\nOh, and national parks are high on our list, too. \ud83d\ude04 I want to fill out one of the passports.\n\nWow, that sounds awesome!\n\nI consider every now and then to \"travel\" around the UK.\n\nAs I am not working in IT yet, my plan is/was to apply a global company which has stores around the country, so I can transfer myself between stores/businesses.  So, I would spend 2-5 months in each city on my list, keep working so I have income and the same time I explore everything in my free time.\n\nAs I came from another country without partner or family member, I already have experience how to spend my free time without feeling alone or lonely.\n\nThere are some really cool meetups and activity groups around the country which I would love to visit.\n\nWhat a cool goal you had! Staying nearby National Parks! If the possibility to work remotely stays in my company, I'd also consider moving closer to the mountains.\n\nThanks for sharing, Ali! I'm planning to be a digital nomad from next year first locally (in my country) and then internationally for the next few years.\n\nIt sounds exciting. Where would you like to go? Which cities are on your list?\n\nWe are planning to do the same next year, but go around Europe and Asia - I will document our adventures as digital nomads :)\n\nWhat a wonderful way to work, Id welcome the private time and time for me. That sounds like a bucket list item I may need to add.\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

I hacked into their computer and captured the USB traffic on it. Could you help me steal the secret?\n\nFlag format: flag{0-9a-z_} (Convert uppercase to lowercase)\n\nAttachments:\n\nFor this challenge, we are given a pcapng that contains USB protocol packets.\n\nMost of the packets are input packets labeled as\n\nby wireshark. There are, however, a few exceptions:\n\nThis packet and the one below it caught my attention because they are both output packets and contains ascii characters that resemble some sort of programming language.\n\nI copied one of the lines and did a quick google search.\n\nis what I found - a TSPL/TSPL2 Programming Language manual. Just like how 3d printers are controlled using G-code, it seems like that printers also have their own programming language.\n\nHere are the commands within the two packets:\n\nThe second packet seems to be the one that actually draws out the flag using two different commands:\n\nand\n\n. Now, I just have to implement the two commands in python and get the flag.\n\nHere is the code for that:\n\nIn the end, we get an image with the flag:\n\nflag:\n\nwho likes singing, dancing, rapping and shell-coding?\n\nThe directories on the server looks something like this:\n\nnc 139.180.215.222 20002\n\nnc 106.52.252.82 20002\n\nAttachments:\n\nAfter a quick analysis of the binary given, we see that the binary reads in 7 bytes of data, zero out most of the registers, and executes the data as shellcode.\n\n7-byte is not a lot. The\n\ninstruction itself takes up 2 bytes. Due to this size limitation, I decided to go with a two-stage approach. First, I will craft a 7-byte payload that will make a read syscall and read in a second stage payload. Second, I will craft a second stage payload that is more than 7 bytes and perform whatever task I want without worrying about any size limitations.\n\nI ran the binary in gdb just to see the state of the registers when our shellcode is being called. This is helpful as it allows us to utilize some of the existing register values:\n\nAs you can see, there\u2019s not a lot to work with, but we do have the address of the current buffer loaded in rdi.\n\nIn order to make the read syscall, we need four things:\n\nWe know that the syscall itself takes up 2 bytes and copying the address of the current buffer from rdi to rsi takes at least 2 bytes. This leaves us 3 bytes to zero out rdi and make rdx a large number:\n\nMy first idea was to move the address of the current buffer to rdx as it is quite a large number; however, it turns out to be too large and would not work.\n\nLooking for inspiration, I came across\n\n. Although it is written for 32 bit instead of 64 bit, it is still quite useful and helped me came up with my final payload:\n\nThis payload only uses 6 bytes of space! It relayed on the fact that\n\nis a single byte instruction, and due to its 32 bit nature, the current address is truncated to only 4 bytes before being loaded into rdx.\n\nNow, we successfully bypassed the size limitation and can run whatever code we want; however, the execve syscall seems to be blocked on the server. Bummer!\n\nBut we can still do an open/read/write to get the flag right? Well, now is a good time to review the challenge description:\n\nThe directories on the server looks something like this:\n\nAs you can see, the flag is hidden in a nested folder, and we need a way to find the path for the flag file.\n\nBasically, we need a way to list the content in a given directory. The first thing that came to me was the\n\ncommand, so I ran a strace on it:\n\nAll that we need is two syscalls:\n\nwhich opens a file descriptor for a given path and\n\nwhich list out the content of a directory.\n\nWith the help of the shellcraft module in pwntools, I quickly created a payload that can read out the content of a given directory:\n\nAnother minor inconvenience is the fact that the\n\nsyscall returns a linux_dirent struct for each file which needs to be parsed. Lucky, we can do that on the client side with python instead of parsing it with assembly:\n\nNow, with the ability to list all files in a given directory, we just need a program to recursively go through all the folders and find the flag file.\n\nBecause the server always timeouts before the flag file can be found, I also added the functionality to preserve progress so that I can get the path using multiple sessions.\n\nHere is the final code:\n\nWith this code, I found the flag file located at\n\n.\n\nNow with a simple payload, we can read out the flag:\n\nflag:"}

Hmm let\u2019s see. What happens when you open a blank page to write? Does anxiety kicks in?

Not many Romanians know about it. It\u2019s more of a regional thing. The people who would cook and eat \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie used to be shepherds. It\u2019s also possible that other cultures have a similar dish but I haven\u2019t yet met someone from outside my family that can describe anything similar to \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie.\n\n\u021a\u0103c\u0103lie is rich in calories and fat and it\u2019s best served hot. The caloric value it offers is extremely important for people like shepherds because of the long hours on the cold mountains. The ingredients and method of making \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie are also accessible. All they\u2019d have to do is carry a chunk of pig fat, some bread and an onion, then make a little fire.\n\nFor me \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie used to be a normal thing, whenever we\u2019d have a family BBQ, \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie was the first thing we made. I really enjoyed it as a kid and took years to learn the proper way of cooking it. Anybody can easily cook \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie but it takes multiple attempts to get all the little details right and perfect your method. This will only lead to the best of \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie, so well cooked that angles will weep for a taste of it.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until high school and talking with some friends that I realised I am the only one who knows about \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie.\n\nI cooked some \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie for some friends of mine and some couldn\u2019t even dare taste it. For some it is\n\nextremely heavy (you\u2019ll understand why shortly).\n\nWarning: Vegans and vegetarians will flee when exposed to \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie\n\n(pig fat with rind, Romanians call it\n\n)\n\nFor cooking you\u2019ll also need a stick (size matters, anything between 30-50cm should be good enough). Make sure the stick is strong enough to hold the chunk of pig fat and not too dry (spoiler alert, it all goes above a fire).\n\nWarning: Do not use a metal stick, the pig fat will slide right out after heating up. I recommend a cherry tree branch with a sharpened tip.\n\nTo get things started slightly cut your pig fat on all sides (excluding the skin side). Do not make the cuts too deep, as it could make it fall apart later. We do this to allow for better and more evenly cooking.\n\nNow cut the bread (slices, about 1cm thick, you can do thicker slices if you feel \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie is too heavy for you) and onion (any shape or size you like, I prefer rings). Place the onions slices/rings on the slices of bread and set everything near your grill.\n\nAt this point you should start your fire. Do not let the flame burn out, \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie is cooked using the flame not active charcoal. Take your stick and put the tip of it inside the fire (enough to chahr it, but don\u2019t set it on fire). Stick your chunk of pig fat on the stick.\n\nThis bit might sound easy but it\u2019s quite tricky to get it right. At this point you should have your chunk of slan\u0103 on the stick, your fire is roaring and the bread with onions is nearby.\n\nRepeat this process until each slice is covered in as much fat as you wish (see final product bellow for reference).\n\nTip: You can use some of the dripping fat to keep the fire alive or to extend it to new sections of the BBQ, thus ensuring you equally activate your charcoal.\n\nTip: When dripping fat on the bread, feel free to slowly and gently press the slan\u0103 on the bread.\n\nMaster tip: Sometimes the tip of your stick will set on fire.\n\n, this is the best thing that could happen but be careful. You can now tilt your stick with the tip facing almost completely down. Keep the stick above the bread and watch how the tiny flame will make the pig fat drip.\n\nAfter doing the above\n\na couple of times you will notice the exterior of the pig fat is cooked, at this point set it near your bread and start cutting the outer layer, revealing more raw uncooked pig fat ready for roasting.\n\nThe cooked fat is placed on top of the bread for added unhealthy pure tastiness.\n\nTip: At the point when you start cutting the first layer of cooked slan\u0103, you might want to take a short break and eat a slice, as \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie is best served hot. Reheating it is an option.\n\nNote: After cutting outer layers, make sure to make some more cuts on the surface to allow for more fat dripping and better roasting.\n\nAgain, repeat the above until all pig fat is cooked. Depending on the rind you have, it may be easy to bite trough and crunchy or extremely tough. It is comestible tho and I personally enjoy it.\n\nThis is how the final product should look like:\n\nIf you weren\u2019t disgusted by possibly the most unhealthy edible thing you\u2019ve ever heard, then you should know a couple of things."}

It was a nice sunny day, hopped on the early 7:45 train to Hope,\n\n. Little did I know that was the start of my new hobby and passion, hiking; as I recently went to Peak District again, done\n\nand the\n\ntrails. More on this down bellow.\n\nI tried to cover the most important aspects of my trip, but hiking is all about the moment and the experience. Hard to put into words the beauty of nature.\n\nBy far the best thing about going away from the day to day city craze, was the silence. After the train left the station, all I could hear was \u2026 nothing. Pure silence. It then occurred to me, that I have\n\nsomething, in a very long time. I had forgotten what silence was; the pure tranquility sensation.\n\nOn the first Hike, I did the climb to Ladybower Dam and got to see quite a bit of nature, the rural areas around Hope and saw how friendly outdoorsy people are. Everyone would salute you and people were more than eager to give directions and help you.\n\nAfter the rather easy hike to the dam, I went up to Win hill, where the view was very rewarding, as the climb is on some steep rocks trough a forested area with a stream of water on the side. From the peak you could see all around the valley and could even see the dam. The walk back down was much easier and quicker as it followed a path down and around the hill instead of climbing rocks.\n\nI would say that the first hiking experience wasn\u2019t that eventful, but nonetheless it was a special moment and the start of something beautiful.\n\nThis took place mid October on a cloudy day with some light rain. The hike was considerably longer than the first one (10km), and this time it involved walking across the peaks of Loose Hill. The view was nice, but due to the clouds and fog, visibility was limited.\n\nThe best part of this hike was the end destination, and what would end up becoming my new post-hike\n\n.\n\nA nice cozy place, right next to Edale Station. The staff there are like a big family, they\u2019re friendly and warm. The decor of the restaurant is homy and the food is just what you need after a long hike. On Sunday they have roast (pork or beef) with veggies and Yorkshire pudding. They also sell local ales (which are some of the best and most refreshing beers I\u2019ve had). To get an idea of how good the beer is, I asked if they sell bottles of the stuff (sadly no), so next time I\u2019ll see if I can bring my own bottle \ud83c\udf7a.\n\nThey are welcoming people, \u201cmuddy boots are welcome\u201d and \u201cdogs are welcome\u201d.\n\nLast weekend I spontaneously decided to go hiking again. I simply craved it, weather was good (by UK standards) and train tickets were still cheap. So I did it. Since my last hike I even invested in a hydration pack and some light, foldable, and strong hiking poles (which came in handy!).\n\nThe hike started off with a superb walk above a brook, trees with red, orange and yellow leaves, you get to cross a couple of rustic looking wooden bridges. The brooks valley even gets narrower and the hills on both sides are quite steep, giving an amazing feel when walking between em.\n\nAbout 2km in, the hike transforms into a little bit of a climb. The path becomes one with the brook and you have to carefully navigate your way from rock to rock on the brook. Then the elevation begins to take off, you start climbing up some rocks, with the brook still there. Making this a treacherous climb where one must be very confident in every move. The climb is about 1km with an elevation gain of 500m. For me that\u2019s the steepest path I had to take so far, but the climb is full of breathtaking scenery and as you go higher you get to see more and more of where you came from.\n\nUpon reaching the peak, you realise it\u2019s actually a plateau and you can see the entire valley where you walked. A little further in, most people will proceed to climb to an even higher peak, but not me. My trail map said\n\nand so I did.\n\nWhat was I expecting? From the map, I knew the trail would pass trough the\n\n. I expected a nice area, abundant in vegetation and tall trees, you know\n\n.\n\nWhat did I get?\n\nThe path I followed (at this point alone, as everybody else would go in the opposite direction) was next to a water stream and as such the ground was rather muddy and soft. Then the trail map said\n\nand so I did. After a while I found myself in a rather muddy area, with no visible path and no obvious direction to follow. The sun was still out and I was about 1/3 of the trail in so I pushed forward.\n\nAfter a kilometre of walking trough some rather shitty conditions (mud and weird terrain), fog set in out of a sudden; combined with the lack of a path and the only direction I knew being\n\n, I pushed on like any sane person would do.\n\nNot 5 minutes later I was in the middle of a post-apocalyptic scenario. Fog everywhere, terrain at this point was composed of\n\ncombined with\n\nand\n\n.\n\nThis is when it hit me. I am in a swamp.\n\nThere were many questions going on in my head at the time:\n\nI realised that I might not have the time (sunset was 2-3 hours away) to juggle around the terrain of the swamp, so I took a split second decision and I started going\n\nin the hopes of intersecting with the public footpath sooner rather than later.\n\nAfter adventuring trough the swamp like a mad man, trying to reach some solid ground. Getting mud all over my boots and pants, finding a rather suspicious metal box under some rocks and getting bad looks from frogs, I eventually got out of the fog, away from the mud and reached the Pennine footpath where I slowly walked my way back to Edale.\n\nIt was definitely an experience that I will not forget. And honestly I would do it again, this time going trough the entire swamp and maybe even see\n\n.\n\nI didn\u2019t cover the entire trip, there were other sights to see, like Jacob\u2019s ladder and the High Peak area.\n\nMore hiking stories to come (with full HD videos of the entire trip)."}

My method of reading the book has been rather unmethodical. Every couple of days/weeks when I feel like it, I pick up the book and continue reading where i last left off. Sometimes when I come across a strong thought (which happens more often than not in this book), I keep that thought in my mind and try to put it into action over time.\n\nThe following excerpt from the book has had a huge impact on me. I think about it very often and it reminds me of other quotes and sayings that I keep close to myself (and have collected mentally over the years)\n\nLiving life as an artist is a practice.\nYou are either engaging in the practice or you\u2019re not.\n\nIt makes no sense to say you\u2019re not good at it\nIt\u2019s like saying, \u201cI\u2019m not good at beting a monk.\u201d\nYou are either living as a monk or you\u2019re not.\n\nWe tend to think of the artist\u2019s work as the output.\n\nThe real work of the artist is a way of being in the world.\n\nThere is another quote from the Psychologist Alfred Adler that I heard back in 2015 and It has impacted the way I act on this very much. The quote goes as follows\n\n\u201cIt is easier to fight for ones principles than to live up to them.\u201d.\n\nSuch a strong statement. We all have principles, and there are principles that we very often are very strict about in \u201cwords\u201d and stricter when we see other people going against it. But, when it comes to us living by those principles, we very easily defy them and create loopholes for our own convenience. The way this has impacted my is as follows \u2013 In most cases before acting and saying things to people, I think if they are pragmatic or rather principle based. If they are principle based, I tend to not speak them as often as I would in past. These are my principles and as long as someone else is not crossing boundaries, I would allow them to live by theirs and I\u2019d \u201ctry\u201d to live by mine. I don\u2019t want to spend my time \u201cfighting\u201d for my principles. Atleast, I am not here to spread it, I think.\n\nThere is one more quote along similar lines as Rick Rubin. It\u2019s from \u201cThe Tibetian book of living and dying\u201d by Sogyal Rinpoche. I unfortunately don\u2019t recall the exact words from the book, and don\u2019t have a copy to get it from. But, the feeling of the words remain with me \u2013\n\nYou cannot meditate for some time and then be not meditating. That is not how meditation works. Meditation is a way of life.\n\nSpeaking for myself, I tend to think a lot about my principles and topics that I am interested in. And based on that, I try to live my life focusing on those topics, learning about them, acting as I belong to learn about those topics and create something with them. Its not important if the creation changes the world. Its not important if the creation is well known in the world. The only thing that is important is that it changes me. And, it changes me for good. I hope."}

Its raining cats and dogs. Actually, It\u2019s been raining non stop for the last 2 nights. The streets are flooded and the very little traffic that is out this stormy morning is being re-routed in multiple places. I am wondering how today will go.\n\n-\nSeveral of the organizing team reach the venue. We are setting up the venue, but there is a cloud of uncertainity. The rain is not something that we had factored in our planning.\n\n-\nI get a message \u201cAvinash, I believe you should consider cancelling today.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a thought that has already cross our minds. There\u2019s news of flood in several locations of Kathmandu. Several landslides have been reported. But we also had a commitment to everyone who registered. Even if just five people showed up, we felt we owed it to them to keep the show running. And that\u2019s exactly what we were going to do.\n\n- The first group of attendees show up. We were not expecting people to show up on time, let alone at all. This was the first motivation we needed for the day.\n\n-  A few more trickled in, and by now we had around 40 people. Not bad, right? Enough for a party. A BarCamp Party.\n\nBy the end of the day we had:\n\nSome fun facts:\n\nAll in all, I am really happy with the event and how it turned out. We (as wwktm) haven\u2019t had organized an event since covid, so getting back on the \u201corganizing\u201d wheel took quite a lot of effort, But in the end, I think we pulled it off.\n\nFor next time, though, if there\u2019s a BarCamp again [1], we\u2019ll definitely plan earlier and budget better. The ticket prices were kept low this time, and unfortunately, we ended up with a few financial losses. But I\u2019d like to think of it as an investment in future events rather than a loss.\n\n[1] Let me know what you thought about the event. Your feedback helps us improve and motivates us to keep going.\n\nUntil then,\n\nBe nice to everyone :D"}

This was a two day event completely focused on developing web applications which would also work on Firefox OS.\n\n###Day 1\nThe first day of the event was aimed at giving the audience an idea of mozilla, the mozilla community and Firefox OS, ofcourse. Vineel started by talking about mozilla and the community, Sayak continued by introducing the idea of Firefox OS and why it was required, Soumya then took on the stage and discussed some technical details about the platform and eventually Robin, Sayak, Biraj and me gave some demos on firefox OS application and the process of writing a basic \u201chello world\u201d application. The talks went pretty well but one thing that struck me was the audience. This was a very different audience, compared to other events because they were paying attention, asking questions, interacting and were actually making sense. Believe me, this rarely happens in an engineering college in India :D.\n\n###Day 2\nThe second day was roughly divided into two parts, the hackaton and the presentations. The hackathon went pretty well and most of the attendees got a taste of, how easy it was to make an application for firefox OS using open web technologies. It was amazing to see about 30 applications being presented at the end of the day. I guess, we can say it was a win!\n\nThat was all about the event. I would like to thank the FORMAT Team, especially Avik, Gaurab and Subhashish for the warm reception and managing the event in such a professional manner. Last but not the least, I got to learn a lot from Biraj, Vineel, Soumya, Robin and Sayak."}

I left in between the event as it didn\u2019t rise up to my expectations. I always thought that BarCamps are an open event with an open platform for people to learn and share their thoughts and hacks, atleast that\u2019s the impression one gets when they read about other BarCamps or its wiki. Since I didn\u2019t attend the whole event and didn\u2019t have the chance to give any feedback to the organizers or the team, I would take this as an opportunity.\n\nFirst of all, I felt very unhappy that the event was called a \u2018BarCamp\u2019 but didn\u2019t follow any of the unconventional conventions of a \u2018BarCamp\u2019. It would\u2019ve been better to name it different (to suit and cater to the proper audience) or to have made it a BarCamp style\u2019d event.\n\nSecond, Its okay to have some predefined speakers IMO to keep the show going, but there should be parallel tracks where people can propose talks or discussions, thus giving everyone an opportunity to share and learn.\n\nLastly, I have tried to stay constructive so that the organizers get an idea about the audience and how they felt at the end of the day. Hopefully, this would result in more interesting and happening events in the future. I\u2019m glad that at-least one of the 8 rules of BarCamp have been followed today (2nd Rule: You do blog about BarCamp.)\n\nPS. this BarCamp was unconventional because conventionally they are supposed to be unconventional, and this one, on the contrary was quite conventional."}

It was a great hike with a nice weather accompanied with some beautiful landscapes. Perfect recipe for a good hike.\n\nLike every other hikes, this one also helped me think deeply and contemplate about a number of things. Among them, most of my energy was spent on thinking about the hike itself.\n\nMost of it was directed towards how can we use Hike for Nepal to create some positive impact, possibly in the hiking location, during the hike. How can we bring some positive change, slowly and steadily.\n\nOne of the things that I noticed, the hike was full of well educated Nepalese who were decently well off (approximately 1 out of 5 had a DSLR, everyone had a pretty good camera phone). This was a great group of people, possibly a specific group that could do a lot for the community. Another topic that bugged me considerably during the hike was all the plastic packaging that was littered over the place. It was sad, how ignorant we have been towards our environment. From Wai-Wai packets to empty bottles everywhere. The first thing that we could definitely do to fight this is by cleaning the mountains and hills during our hikes. I did my part during the hike and we did something similar in one of our hikes in the Bavarian Alps.\n\nThe question that I would like to ask is, how can we scale this idea of cleaning the mountains during our hike? How do we scale it from one person to the whole group. The biggest benefit of this would be that hikers would learn to clean the mountains and take back their own garbage with them. Thus, ensuring the mountains to be clean, the nature to be serene and experiences to be breathtaking.\n\nFinally, I would like to remind one of the rules from the Golden Rules for Living\n\nIf you open it, close it.\nIf you turn it on, turn it off.\nIf you unlock it, lock it up.\nIf you break it, admit it.\nIf you can\u2019t fix it, call in someone who can.\nIf you borrow it, return it.\nIf you value it, take care of it.\n\nIf you move it, put it back.\nIf it belongs to someone else and you want to use it, get permission.\nIf you don\u2019t know how to operate it, leave it alone.\nIf it\u2019s none of your business, don\u2019t ask questions.\nIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it.\nIf it will brighten someone\u2019s day, say it.\nIf it will tarnish someone\u2019s reputation, keep it to yourself.\n\u2014 Found somewhere in the vast vast internet, Source unknown"}

In some cases I have also added the reasoning or the idea that is being sent across by the text or just notest that made sense to accompany them. I am still reading the whole essay and will at one point write my thoughts and views on it (maybe).\n\nThe essay mostly talks about why its important to know thyself; why knowing yourself and accepting your thoughts might be tough. The following part of the text talks about the times when one was not courageous enough to speak their heart or do what they heeded to do, and later realized that someone else said/did it and got all the glory (though some parts of the text also deals with why getting the glory, or working to get the glory is not important at all)\n\nA man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within, more than the lustre of the firmament of bards and sages. Yet he dismisses without notice his thought, because it is his. In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts: they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.\n\n.. Else, to-morrow a stranger will say with masterly good sense precisely what we have thought and felt all the time, and we shall be forced to take with shame our own opinion from another.\n\nThis part of the essay deals with one having to do something that they don\u2019t like, but are doing it just because it made sense at one point of time and they don\u2019t want to contradict themselves. It somehow goes into the lines of\n\nwhere one has the mental stress or discomfort because of contradictory beliefs in their mind and are motivated to reduce this dissonance (Based on the definition from wikipedia)\n\nThe other terror that scares us from self-trust is our consistency; a reverence for our past act or word, because the eyes of others have no other data for computing our orbit than our past acts, and we are loath to disappoint them.\n\nBut why should you keep your head over your shoulder? Why drag about this corpse of your memory, lest you contradict somewhat you have stated in this or that public place? Suppose you should contradict yourself; what then? It seems to be a rule of wisdom never to rely on your memory alone, scarcely even in acts of pure memory, but to bring the past for judgment into the thousand-eyed present, and live ever in a new day. In your metaphysics you have denied personality to the Deity: yet when the devout motions of the soul come, yield to them heart and life, though they should clothe God with shape and color. Leave your theory, as Joseph his coat in the hand of the harlot, and flee.\n\nWith consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words, and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said to-day. \u2014 \u2018Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood.\u2019 \u2014 Is it so bad, then, to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh.\n\nThe following paragraph tries to talk about the moment, and how one should live in the present and not sulk in the past or worry about the future. It is somehow way more philosophical compared to the rest of the text till this part. Similar ideas have been mentioned in Buddhist texts that talk about mindfulness and being available for the moment rathar than being in a different point of time.\n\nMan is timid and apologetic; he is no longer upright; he dares not say \u2018I think,\u2019 \u2018I am,\u2019 but quotes some saint or sage. He is ashamed before the blade of grass or the blowing rose. These roses under my window make no reference to former roses or to better ones; they are for what they are; they exist with God to-day. There is no time to them. There is simply the rose; it is perfect in every moment of its existence. Before a leaf-bud has burst, its whole life acts; in the full-blown flower there is no more; in the leafless root there is no less. Its nature is satisfied, and it satisfies nature, in all moments alike. But man postpones or remembers; he does not live in the present, but with reverted eye laments the past, or, heedless of the riches that surround him, stands on tiptoe to foresee the future. He cannot be happy and strong until he too lives with nature in the present, above time.\n\nOn failure, and pressures from the society and believing in yourself.\n\nIf our young men miscarry in their first enterprises, they lose all heart. If the young merchant fails, men say he is ruined. If the finest genius studies at one of our colleges, and is not installed in an office within one year afterwards in the cities or suburbs of Boston or New York, it seems to his friends and to himself that he is right in being disheartened, and in complaining the rest of his life. A sturdy lad from New Hampshire or Vermont, who in turn tries all the professions, who teams it, farms it, peddles, keeps a school, preaches, edits a newspaper, goes to Congress, buys a township, and so forth, in successive years, and always, like a cat, falls on his feet, is worth a hundred of these city dolls. He walks abreast with his days, and feels no shame in not \u2018studying a profession,\u2019 for he does not postpone his life, but lives already. He has not one chance, but a hundred chances. Let a Stoic open the resources of man, and tell men they are not leaning willows, but can and must detach themselves; that with the exercise of self-trust, new powers shall appear; that a man is the word made flesh, born to shed healing to the nations, that he should be ashamed of our compassion, and that the moment he acts from himself, tossing the laws, the books, idolatries, and customs out of the window, we pity him no more, but thank and revere him, and that teacher shall restore the life of man to splendor, and make his name dear to all history.\n\nTo the end of the essay, the author talks about the\n\n. To begin with, I had a totally different view on travelling, like the \u201chow it changes you\u201d and \u201cyou discover yourself\u201d view that the world has, but since the last\n\n\u2044\n\nmonths, I have come to realise that travelling is just a concept that has come from romantic consumerism. Author\n\nbriefly talks about it in his book\n\nas well. Nevertheless, this is a different view on the same thing and was quite interesting to read, since it is dated from the 19th century.\n\nTravelling is a fool\u2019s paradise. Our first journeys discover to us the indifference of places. At home I dream that at Naples, at Rome, I can be intoxicated with beauty, and lose my sadness. I pack my trunk, embrace my friends, embark on the sea, and at last wake up in Naples, and there beside me is the stern fact, the sad self, unrelenting, identical, that I fled from. I seek the Vatican, and the palaces. I affect to be intoxicated with sights and suggestions, but I am not intoxicated. My giant goes with me wherever I go.\n\nTo wrap things up,\nA quote from the book Khushi by Vijay Kumar (\u0916\u0941\u0938\u0940 - \u0935\u093f\u091c\u092f \u0915\u0941\u092e\u093e\u0930 ) is very apt to this topic:\n\n\u0905\u093e\u092b\u0942\u0932\u093e\u0908 \u0905\u093e\u092b\u0948\u0901 \u092a\u0930\u093f\u092d\u093e\u0937\u093f\u0924 \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0928\u0901 \u092d\u0928\u0947 \u0905\u0930\u0941\u0932\u0947 \u092e\u0932\u093e\u0908 \u0924\u093f\u0928\u0915\u0948 \u0938\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0926\u0905\u0928\u0941\u0938\u093e\u0930 \u092a\u0930\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0930 \u092c\u0928\u093e\u090f\u0930 \u0916\u093e\u0928\u0947\u091b\u0928\u094d \u0964\n\u2013 \u0932\u094b\u0930\u094d\u0921\u0947\n> If I don\u2019t define myself others will make a dish of me based on their taste and eat.\n\nPS: still reading and will be adding stuff"}

Nothing has changed in the once peaceful country. That peaceful country where people are fighting; They are divided, divided by caste, divided by religion, divided by color, divided by reason, divided without any reason. Fight all day long, fight for your ego, fight for the fake pride and then in the end of the day take pride in being the most peaceful country in the world, take pride in being the most peaceful people, take pride in coming from the land of Buddha. Great, at least we are the quintessential hypocrites.\n\nIt\u2019s sad to see the leaders fighting like children. Oh come on, we had fairer fights when we were kids. It\u2019s funny to see the parties organize a meeting with the other parties, and follow it with their own personal meetings; its clear they have no philosophy, no pride, no compassion, all they want is to maximize their profits. This child play has been the norm in one way; it has pulled everyone centuries behind. Centuries behind in thinking, in science, in contribution to society.\n\nThe smart world is working on nurturing the future generation. We? we have already lost them, we have failed them. Those kids should be studying in school, challenging their teachers, learning from their mentors, painting, drawing and solving that random equation. But, NO! They are everywhere but not where they should be. They are sitting in home playing, they are working in that brick factory where they legally shouldn\u2019t be, and they are lying on that corner of the street burning grass. But then, how could they go to school? The teachers are not motivated to teach the students; In most cases, they are there because that is the last job they could find, one that pays the least and our society has accepted it that way. Why? Simply because they are not a part of the vicious romantic consumerism cycle. If only they could produce something that could be exchanged with money. All they are doing is building the future, adding some fine touches to it, how can that be important? No gains at all!\n\nThe situation is saddening, and its getting worse day by day. Every day a political party is angry, the schools are closed! a wife and a husband have a fight, the schools are closed. I am sure this situation frustrates many more and I am aware that there are wiser beings that are working on fixing this, trying to be a part of the solution. Not rant like me by making a fuss of the problem. I think there is only one right way to solve this problem and its not a quick one, its one that takes its time but does the job. We have to change our culture, our society, our views. Education has to be taken seriously. We have to build better schools, develop infrastructure. Not schools that are money making machines, but schools that are shaping better humans and better futures. Invest the money a school generates into the teachers, into other schools. Build standards, standards that schools have to be built up to. The government has to play an active role in this, the political parties have to play an active role in this, we the citizens have a bigger role to play in this. Government schools have to rise, rise to standards that set benchmarks. The system has to invest into the future, the future that will build the system in return."}

It\u2019s 9:15am and Ravi dai, our MC for the day kicks off the show. Each talk was interesting and gave enough to the audience. Enough to implement, research and learn once they were back from the event.\nThere were number of fun moments while the speakers were on stage. Some of my most memorable ones are\n\nEven though the internet was patchy, it was exciting to see the attendees posting a lot of fun stories and pictures on social media. The day was intense, full of insightful talks and many nice memories to go back and sleep on.\n\nHike more. Worry Less. - anonymous\n\nIt\u2019s 6:00am, the designated time to leave for the hike and guess what, our venue is not open yet !! Damn, Guard Dai !!! Finally, the venue opens up, we fill our bottles, get an initial briefing about the hike, get into our Sajha bus and off we go.\n\nWe reach Lakhuri Bhanjyang and Kailash from artudio gives an amazing introduction to art. He explains how you can do art with anything and it likes in the eyes of the maker. We then divide into groups based on our tshirt color -\n\n. The whole hike we used materials from nature to build small art pieces. It was the best exercise to get to know other people from our groups.\n\nThe main motive of the hike was for the attendees, speakers and organizers to mingle more and get to network at a more deeper level. I think that\u2019s what exactly happened as I got to talk to so many people and know what they were doing, get an understanding of their point of view and have deeper conversations about tech, life, community and nature.\n\nApart from the main conference and hike, some of the speakers and attendees took the opportunity to do other activities. Some of the highlights are:\n\nThere will definitely be a next wwktm. In what capacity, design, format? That is a thought for another blog post.\n\nUntil then,\n\nBe nice to everyone :D"}
{"url": "https://avinash.com.np/2014/02/23/what-i-initially-planned-to-do-this-summer/", "origin": "https://avinash.com.np/", "title": "What I initially planned to do this summer", "content": "TL;DR : This is mostly going to be a post about how things have fucked up recently and how my plans of doing an internship this summer went into the dump and some extensions and pre-post thought process to that.\n\nMy ideal summer would be an internship at one of the best tech companies working and learning with/from the most talented people of the industry. Contrary to the fact that a lot would suggest to do it at a startup, I wanted to do it at a big company because I have never worked at one and wanted to learn from that experience. It must be magic to manage so many people, so many developers and still spit out the best of the products.\n\nI applied to number of companies but I would like to comment on my experience with facebook, microsoft and mozilla. Facebook was kind of sad because I had an interview where I was asked some basic questions about JavaScript and we talked about how some things were implemented in facebook. Post the interview, they didnt reply for about a month and when I contacted the recruiter, got a reply that I couldn\u2019t be offered a postition. Sad :\u2018(\n\nNext was Microsoft. This one was really surprising because the interviewer asked me some really random question and two puzzles and eventually replied with a negative. Maybe I was supposed to not solve the puzzles.\n\nWhen all this action was happening, I had also applied for an internship at mozilla. This was one that I had some expectations from, mostly because I had been a contributor to mozilla for some time and luckily there was an open internship position for a project that I had already been contributing to. I applied and Kaboom, \u201cwe did not find a fit this time\u201d. This was very disheartening, but I eventually talked to one of the project devs about it and he told that he\u2019d look into it. About a week later, I got an email from a recruiter saying they\u2019d like to interview me for the internship. Yay!\n\nWell, that did sound awesome, I hopped into the opportunity and did some reading, sharpening that blade. I had 3 really interesting interviews and after quite a long wait I got an email which basically said that they\u2019d like to move with another candidate mostly because he had more experience and I still had a year of university to learn from(o_O).\n\nSo, basically after this I was quite sad and felt really bad. I for one thought a lot about this and there were the times when I thought maybe I was not good at all. This brought me to think about some of my open source contributions as well. I used to contribute to open source mostly because I was learning a lot and learned a lot about good code, code review, processes and approach to some serious problems. But, with of all of this it also felt like why was I even contributing to a project where I was not even worth it. Sadly, I do feel that at times, but I like it when I learn.\n\nI know recruiting is a tough work and there are some tough and quick decisions to make because of which a lot of factors come into play like where one comes from, where one is currently located, one\u2019s name and lots of other tiny details. I dont say its intentional but everyone is judgemental when you have to make a decision. That is why I know lots of amazing people back in India and Nepal who have been rejected who I think are among the A grade talent and lots of people would agree to me. Maybe there\u2019s a problem, one that seriously needs to be solved. But yes, this doesn\u2019t change the fact that I may be useless as well (lets hope I\u2019m not).\n\nWell, I have been conspirating on some secret schemes with a bunch of amazing people and I must say, I am enjoying it. Regarding contributing to mozilla, I would be (as a developer)inactive for a while, for sure, maybe a lot more. But I am still the guy who contributes to the open web and loves to see the web crossing it boundaries."}

Where is Fun? It is so relative I have learned, it depends on how your mind is wired and where your heart it. For some, partying all night long and having an insane night might be the fun that quenches the thirst. But, for some, maybe being able to stick to the timeline might just be the fun that is added to life. Being able to sleep on time and wake up a fresh man every other day is just what you find fun in. Maybe when you are partying In a club, that moment you have of being bored might be just when you feel sad that your weeks schedule is wasted . And that\u2019s where you know where you really find fun in.\n\nJust think about it though, main stream media had just brainwashed everyone to think that there is only one type of fun and that one type of fun is what\u2019s cool. Who are they to define what is cool? Who are they to rule on what our heart thinks of our mind ?\n\nWell, that fairly brings me to the main point. Do what you like, hear that silent vibration in that random corner of your heart. Do what you think is right, but think for once, is it really right ? Or are you being selfish ? Or are you just not being empathetic. Rely on that one self that you know, that you must believe in, that one self you are."}

It fills me with pride looking at how far we have come, and how colorful and eventful (ba-dum-tiss) the community has become. There is an event every week or so, community-leaders are meeting often discussing about maximizing community interaction. The best part of it is that the community also feels that we need to have such events. Now, that\u2019s all Roses, lets talk about the Thorns. I would like to disucss a Thorn in specific.\n\nIt hasn\u2019t even been a week in 2017 and I have had two event invites. YAY! that\u2019s so awesome, right? NO! Why? you may ask. The reason is that I couldn\u2019t attend either of the two events. People were notified a couple of days in advance about the event. I\u2019m really sorry to put this out, even though it should have been obvious, two days prior notice for a meeting/event  is too less of a time. Inviting the community atleast one week in advance should be part of the event etiquette recipe. We are failing at this. It is a collective failure and we should try to fix this.\n\nSo, what can we do about this? I have a proposition especially for dev/tech events.\n\nIf there is a better way of doing this, I am all ears, lets talk in the slack channel."}
{"url": "https://avinash.com.np/2017/07/15/corrupt-or-unorganized/", "origin": "https://avinash.com.np/", "title": "Corrupt or Unorganized", "content": "Chaos is a Ladder \u2014 Little Finger, GoT\n\nThis is to compare and contrast two worlds, two stories that seem the same but totally different experiences.\n\nI don\u2019t remember the exact date, but, in 2014 someone shipped me a piece of gadget to Germany. I got a letter which asked to be present at the customs office in 3 days.\n\nI went to the customs office. Had a talk with a super helpful lady, who helped me get my shipment. She then asked me to open the package, did an inspection of what was shipped. Finally, she told me the import duty  which I had to pay for the shipment. In less than 15 minutes I was out of the office and my job was done.\n\nOne month ago someone again shipped me a piece of gadget. This time it was sent to Kathmandu, Nepal. FedEx told me that my shipment was at the airport customs and I had to get hold of an agent at the customs to get my shipment. They delivered me the documents which I could use to extract the shipment.\n\nAll good and fine. I talked to an agent and handed him my documents, which were to be used to extract the shipment from the customs. I hoped it to be a quick and painless process. Unfortunately, the introduction of an agent to the process keeps us in the dark; Now, I have no idea what\u2019s going on in customs land.\n\nEach of my discussion with the customs agent was basically that the shipment couldn\u2019t be extracted and they\u2019ll try again tomorrow. After ~20 days I pushed the agent a little and tried to get more details. According to them, someone had shipped gold via FedEx which is why customs were not letting any FedEx document be extracted.\n\nI went to the customs office, and It was chaotic. It took me hours to find the right person to talk to. Basically, just to hear the same gold story again.\n\nIn the mean time, I mentioned this to FedEx as well, the only support they could give me was \u201cI\u2019ll talk to my superior and see how we can help you here\u201d\n\nFast forward today, I still don\u2019t have my shipment. Nepal Government still doesn\u2019t have the customs duty they deserve. Lose-Lose situation. Unless, my shipment has been hijacked and a customs official has gifted it to his son. Then, someone does win here. Believe me, I have heard stories of that happening.\n\nThis process is seriously messed up and is the story of pretty much every government office in Nepal. The processes in offices are so chaotic, super ad-hoc and enough touch points to exploit a person. Which is also the reason why going to a government office is a dreadful experience every time.\n\nOur systems are messed up, our processes are messed up and the sad part is that there is no one doing anything about it. The only place one can complain or state grievances is to a twitter handle (or bot) of HelloSarkar. It definitely gives one a feeling of being heard, but nothing happens in the end.\n\nThis one time, all I have is a rant. No solutions, No actions that can be taken to make things better.

{"url": "https://avinash.com.np/2013/11/01/the-month-of-mozilla--learning-teaching-and-experiencing-the-openweb/", "origin": "https://avinash.com.np/", "title": "The Month of Mozilla : Learning, Teaching and Experiencing the OpenWeb", "content": "To make things less confusing, lets start from the beginning. It all started back in mid-2013 when my twitter stream and facebook newsfeed was filled with status-es like \u201cIt\u2019s official, you\u2019re invited! Yay!\u201d and there in my mailbox was an unread email with the same subject. Yes, It was official and I was invited too :D. It was an invitation to attend the Mozilla Summit 2013 to be hosted simulatneously in 3 cities (Brussels, Toronto and Santa-Clara) and with the mission for (almost) all mozillians to come together, get inspired, talk and shape the future of the open web.\n\nFast forward to October 2013, after a flight from Munich via Amsterdam, I was standing in front of the Brussles airport, there were the amazing summit volunteers waiting to greet mozillians and make sure we reach the right hotel. I checked into the hotel, went to the square to grab dinner/snacks and the awesome goodie bag. Next stop was the Delirium Cafe (also known for having the guiness world record for the most variety of beer in 2004) where i met a lot of awesome mozillians.\n\nOver the next couple(+1) of days i attended sessions related to privacy on the web (where we discussed about ghostery and collusion- now knows as Lightbeam), using the developer tools to debug other XUL based applications (especially thunderbird), Mozilla Reps program, MDN, OpenBadges, having a million mozillians. One thing that i liked about each session is that it was a two way session and it included more discussions and less of one way communication.\n\nOther than the sessions, I think the world fair and the innovation fair were the two awesome places to be in the summit as it gave one an opportunity to see how spread we are as mozillians and how awesome we are too.\n\nWell, you attended an event - AWESOME, but what you take away from the event decides how successful it was and how it would help you in the coming days. Here\u2019s what i got to takeaway.\n - Getting to know some of the faces behing the IRC nicks, turns out i couldnt\u2019 meet all the faces\n - Meeting the mozillians from Europe. I would like to give a special shout out to Axel Grude (the awesome AMO guru), Raivis (The Latvian mozillian, localizer, webdev, awesome!), Rimas (localizer, techie from Lithuania) and Sjmur (Mozilla ireland community manager).\n - A week after the summit and i had already helped Axel test(and find a bug too) one of his\n\nand made it to his contributor list.\n - Last but not the least, leaving with the motivation to do more and the feeling that your work is making a difference.\n\nAnother mail, another set of flights and here I am in London, Running to the Mozilla office directly from the airport to attend a reps meeting session regarding the Mozilla Festival. Oh, did i say that this was the biggest MozFest till date. This was quite a different event from other Mozilla events, because of the new set of audience and the new set of motivation. The Mozilla Festival is all about building and hacking, as they say (F*ck it, Ship it).\n\nThe first day of the event officially started with the science fair at the evening, leaving us (as facilitators) a whole day to get an idea of the flow of the event and our role in it. Me and Prashish were part a of the scrum led by Kat and Laura, where we had a wall full of problems and an army of awesome-scurm-leads (More on the scrum later). Then we had the hack-your-tshirt session where we hacked our tshirts with spray paint and sketch-pens. The event had a mega version of it with paints and what not (more on that later). Then, kicked off the real deal of the day, the Science festival. There were some awesome projects, experiments and products being displayed but i would like to give a special mention to goolabs (for their awesome work with 3d on the web), Erase all kittens(for how awesome+weird+different their approach to teaching and gaming is) and the tactile web demo from the Mozilla Japan team (believe me they were awesome)\n\nThe Day 2 kicked off with the keynotes and then moving to the track they belonged to. I first went to the #teachTheWeb track, as we were part of that track. There was a beautiful wall of\n\nwaiting to be in the making and be made eventually :D . Then i went to the openbadges section to hack on some custom badges and badges of the future. While browsing other badges i was way inspired by the\n\n. Then came the most important and happening event of the day, the Maker-Party. I am so glad that i didnt miss it, because the aurora and the spirit at the maker party was amazing (more than that). People working on stop-motion-videos, children learning to code, people making games using scratch, making (the so sweet)kumi dolls, and a lot more (there were so many things happening that i might have forgot some). That was most of the first day which ended with some awesome conversations with Henrik, Jan, Prashishh, Michael and Leo over the course of Japanese food.\n\nThe third day was mostly similar with attending more awesome sessions, meeting more awesome people, painting some more t-shirts :P and learning more intriguing ways to teach and engage people.\n\nI think the biggest takeaway from this event was how important learning is and how big a role the teacher/teaching method plays in the process. I personally learned a variety of different ways people were using to teach webmaking and moreover dozens of ways people were using the web to make things. Again, a big shout out to all the Mozilla Reps (you all are awesome), It was a great pleasure meeting each one of you.\n\nWell, I wanted to especially thank the Mozilla Nepal community (especially Avash for taking the lead initially), and the people behind the first Mozilla South Asian Meetup, where i got to meet all the community leaders (especially Deb, who is my mentor too) who eventually guided me and helped me to contribute."}

If we all had to grow our own food, we wouldn\u2019t waste a third of if (as we do now in the UK). If we had to make our own tables and chairs, we wouldn\u2019t throw them out the moment we changed the interior d\u00e9cor. If we could see the look on the face of the child who, under the eyes of an armed soldier, cuts the cloth for the garment we contemplate buying on the high street, we\u2019d probably give it a miss. If we could see the conditions in which a pig is slaughtered, it would put most of us off our bacon butty. If we had to clean our own drinking water, we sure as hell wouldn\u2019t shit in it.\u201d\n\nToday, Friday the\n\nis considered to be the biggest shopping festival of the year, also (in) famously termed as Black Friday. People go out on a limb and buy more stuff than they need, even more stuff than they can consume and even more stuff than they can ever make sense of. Why? Because its cheap and because the rest of the world is also doing it.\n\nToday, Friday the\n\nhas also been very smartly chosen (like every year) as the\n\n. The idea of it is not to stop people from buying on this chosen date, but it is to start understanding about one\u2019s consuming behavior and\n\n. People should start connecting with the things they consume, connecting with the people who make them and try to understand the implications of what they buy and what kind of processes they are giving their money to.\n\nThe Motto is simple \u201c Buy what you need, not what you want. \u201c. Our choices has led us to industrialization, which brought a lot of nice goodies and with all the nice came the bad as well. The world got divided, the poor countries make and the rich countries consume. There is an incentive to have cheap labor in the world. The only way we can make a difference is by being aware of our choices. I find it funny that we have to pay a premium for \u201cfair-trade\u201d and are very comfortable with the default. Shouldn\u2019t it be the other way round, that all products are \u201cfair-trade\u201d by default and the products that have had unfair procedures would be labeled as \u201cunfair-trade\u201d. I guess, that would be a good behavioral hack.\n\nThese are just some of my thoughts about consumerism. I like the idea of the\n\n, pushing us to be better humans, to be a better part of the society, be more aware of the world and our impact to it and taking a step by being the change we want to see. Remember,\n\n\u201cIt is easier to fight for one\u2019s principles than to live up to them.\u201d\n\nSo, live up to your principles. Make sure you have some, if not, I think ^^ (up there) is a good starting point :) ."}
{"url": "https://avinash.com.np/2015/11/22/on-forgiveness/", "origin": "https://avinash.com.np/", "title": "On Forgiveness", "content": "What do you think is the right course of action, bringing justice by punishment or forgiving the wrongdoer? Fighting the fight for ego or forgiving? These are tough discussions to have and there is enough philosophical evidence to justify either side of the argument. I have come to believe that there is no \u201cright-way\u201d or \u201cthe recipe\u201d that one can follow, one must always think about the implications, the stakeholders involved and the bigger picture and take the righteous action. Even though there is no golden rule there are set of doctrines and frameworks one can follow that is considered to be on a higher moral ground.\n\nMost of the times when we are thinking of forgiveness, the alternate course of action is radical, extreme, one that we consider not ourselves. The reason to be in such a state is generally because our pride has been touched, the ego has been hurt and betrayal has been committed.\n\n.. the same dualism underlies the nature and condition of man. Every excess causes a defect; every defect an excess. Every sweet hath its sour; every evil its good. Every faculty which is a receiver of pleasure has an equal penalty put on its abuse. It is to answer for its moderation with its life. For every grain of wit there is a grain of folly\u2026\n\nEmerson has very nicely said that the world is an equation and everything that is done will have a reaction. If that\u2019s the case then does it not make sense to follow the path of peace and let nature do its job. Why should we take part in the wrongdoing? Because we want to satisfy our ego, want our pride back. What guarantee is there that the pride is restored after the action? None. Maybe it is better to live without pride, without happiness. Being neutral in every sense. Every happiness will have its sadness.\n\nNo man had ever a point of pride that was not injurious to him.\n\nSimilar was the situation of Yudhishthir in Mahabharat when he was persuaded by his wife and brothers to go to war and fight against Duryodhan. This was during their time in exile. His response was that its harder to give forgiveness, it takes more energy to forgive.\n\nForgiveness is the strength of the virtuous. To fight is easy, but to forgive is difficult. To be patient is not to be weak; to seek peace is always the wiser course.\n\nThe epic has it that they went to war, the great battle of kurukshetra took place and after numerous tricks and deceits of Krishna (the charioteer and God) they win the war, they get their kingdom back. At this point of time Yudhishthir doesn\u2019t have pride in winning the war, is not content to have his kingdom back. On the contrary, he is sad, in remorse, in pain, thinking about all the deaths of his teacher, his brothers, his men.\n\nTo get a piece of the earth we totally abandoned men who were equal to the earth, men whom we should never have killed. And now we live with our kinsmen dead and our wealth exhausted\u2026 like dogs we greedily went after a piece of meat! Now our piece of meat is gone, and so are those who would have eaten it. The heroes are dead. The evil is done. Our kindgom has been laid waste. Having killed them, our rage is gone. Now this grief holds me in check!\nExcerpts from Mahabharat -\n\n(The difficulty of being Good)\n\nOne might argue if the path of forgiveness is always the higher moral ground, wouldn\u2019t the world be unfair. What would have happened to slavery in America? what would happen to Indians under the British Raaj ? What would have happened to Jews during WWII ? These are all valid questions and it does seem like forgiveness has a conflict with Justice in a larger sense.\n\nOne way to look at it is by weighing the deeds. Some deeds have so much evil, there is so much bad into it that it is beyond forgiveness or the psychological burden of forgiveness is too high to be granted. This does mean that its not our strength at display but our weakness at display in this case. In Mahabharat, Yudhishthir before going to war, justifies it as his duty and an act he must do even though he doesn\u2019t like it. Maybe the idea is to look at the bigger good and act accordingly. These are nevertheless really tough decisions to make and maybe your duty is what can justify the course of action. Maybe that is how Jack Dorsey would also justify\n\n.\n\nThese are very tough topics to think about and to come to a worthy conclusion. All I can say and suggest is to think of the possibilities, weight all the options, see the impact and then eventually\n\n. One fun learning I\u2019ve had is that, it is much easier to write on this topic than to have a contextual discussion."}

When I was\n                            18, I dropped out of university to support a friend accused of terrorism, because I believe\n                            it\u2019s most important to support people when others don\u2019t.

I\u2019ve spent the last decade working on that\n                            because I think it could be one of the keys to making AI safe.\n\nServing others and working on important problems is a privilege, but it isn't the only thing\n                            I want in life.\n                            More than almost anything, I want to have a family: to have a partner and children to share\n                            life with.\n                            I\u2019ve been lucky to date several wonderful women, but it\u2019s always turned out we weren\u2019t quite\n                            looking for the same things.

Dreams and ideas which spark my excited\n                            enthusiasm. Facts about the world which trigger an earnest drive to help. These topics feel\n                            close to who I am, woven into my soul. When I\u2019m around others who share similar feelings,\n                            part of me opens up. I am more myself, and can form deeper connections.\n\nA formative experience for me has been moral loneliness. As a young child, I was upset about\n                            how animals are treated but didn\u2019t know anyone with similar beliefs. As a teenager, I\n                            struggled with the Bible and became an atheist. But becoming an atheist left me alone in\n                            caring intensely about global poverty (this is something I still admire about the church I\n                            grew up in). As an adult, I\u2019m lucky to have found friends and community with similar values\n                            but\u2026 I\u2019d really love to find moral connection in a relationship.\n\nWhat do I mean by \u201cmoral connection\u201d? I don\u2019t mean believing all the same things: the last\n                            thing I\u2019d want would be for either of us to feel constrained in our independent moral\n                            judgment! But I think it would be lovely to have enough shared fundamental values to not\n                            feel alone, and to really see and value in each other our efforts to be good people. (I\n                            suspect an important part of balancing moral independence and connection is\n\n.)\n\nWhat are my values? I try \u2013 although I obviously don't always live up to this \u2013 to be\n                            genuinely truth-seeking, care about the welfare of all humans and animals, and be willing to\n                            act to improve them. I viscerally care about animal welfare and global poverty. I work on AI\n                            safety because I think there's a serious risk of it being unsafe. (Many values I hold are\n                            associated with Effective Altruism. However, there are also some things I'd disagree with\n                            the EA mainstream on, and I generally value moral independence.)\n\nI\u2019m not sure how exactly to articulate this, but I feel like the default trajectory of my\n                            life is to optimize it for efficiency and impact. Those are meaningful things to me \u2013\n                            especially as they relate to helping the world \u2013 but I don\u2019t want that to be the entirety of\n                            my life. I also don\u2019t want to get pulled into consumerism, or hedonism, or lots of other\n                            lifestyle attractors around me. Instead, I\u2019m \u2013 confusedly, graspingly, stumbling \u2013 trying to\n                            find something related to family, and connection, and reflection, and integrity.\n                            Wholesomeness.\n\nSomehow this idea of seeking \u201cwholesomeness\u201d feels very intertwined with relationships. I\n                            guess because \u201cfamily\u201d feels like a central part of it? Or because many of these things feel\n                            most meaningful when you\u2019re sharing them with someone?\n\nI\u2019m not really sure what it would look like for us to try and find wholesomeness in this\n                            sense. It\u2019s something we\u2019d need to find out together! Maybe we should live in a village with\n                            friends. Maybe we should build a home and live in the woods. Maybe we should drink tea every\n                            morning together as the sun rises. Maybe it\u2019s smaller subtle things. But if the vague thing\n                            I\u2019m gesturing at resonates with you, I\u2019d at least be an enthusiastic partner as we stumble\n                            towards it together.\n\nAside: I really like\n\nas one\n                            possible vision of \u201cwholesomeness\u201d, in particular threads that just have pictures of his\n                            family and their home.\n\nI find math deeply beautiful, and I get a lot of meaning out of it. This is true of science\n                            broadly as well, although to a somewhat lesser extent. I get a lot of joy out of learning\n                            and exploring and being curious and discovering. I\u2019d love to share that with you. I\u2019d love\n                            to work through a textbook we both find interesting, or research some topic, or do a small\n                            project. I\u2019d love to whiteboard, and share what we\u2019re thinking about, and be curious about\n                            the world together.\n\n(It\u2019s worth saying that this isn\u2019t necessarily an easy thing to do. I think a lot of people\n                            who are very intellectual can feel intellectually insecure talking to their partner. What if\n                            they say something \u201cdumb\u201d and their partner rejects them intellectually? But I think if we\n                            want to, we can work together to have an environment that\u2019s safe and allows us to explore\n                            ideas together.)\n\n... I also just find it really attractive when someone is genuinely fascinated by math or\n                            science. I'm usually slow to develop crushes, but a striking exception was an occasion when\n                            someone at a party rambled to me about cool biology papers they'd read recently for half an\n                            hour. Instant crush.\n\nMore than almost anything, I\u2019m excited to have a family with a partner someday. I\u2019m excited\n                            to do it with a particular set of motivations: to have a family, not just because it\u2019s a\n                            thing people do by default, but because it\u2019s an adventure we\u2019re both deeply excited for and\n                            invested in. To be trying to learn, together, how to make it beautiful and meaningful and\n                            alive, even when there are tricky moments. (To be clear: I fully expect having children to\n                            have lots of unpleasant and exhausting parts!)\n\nI\u2019m excited to have children, but I\u2019m even more excited to have children with someone. When I\n                            imagine it, a big part of what I\u2019m looking forward to is sharing it as a powerful, deep\n                            connection to my partner. Just the thought that there\u2019s a small possibility that a\n                            relationship might someday lead to having children with someone gives me an almost\n                            intoxicating sense of connection.\n\nI love going on walks after it rains. These photos were all taken at a\n                                park near my house. I\u2019d love to show you if we end up dating!\n\nIt\u2019s often unclear why relationships don\u2019t work out, but here are a few things I think were\n                            factors, in case they can help us avoid similar incompatibilities:\n\nDating profiles can be highly polished pictures of someone. I\u2019ve tried very hard to be\n                            earnest, but even so it\u2019s a very limited view. Thankfully, I have years of a pretty\n                            extensive online presence that might offer a more holistic picture. One starting point might\n                            be the\n\nand\n\n, or this\n\n.

And only in Japan. It centers on a young boy, Boku, spending a month of his summer vacation with his aunt, uncle, and their family in the countryside of Japan in August of 1975.\n\nPlayers can explore the countryside as Boku, collect bugs, fish, fly kites, and other low-stakes activities you might expect from a child on summer break.\n\nSlowly, you learn about the people around you and their stories.\n\nSounds simple, but watch Tim\u2019s review and you\u2019ll see that the game is a subtle masterclass in storytelling, menu design, cinematography, typography, skeuomorphism, Japanese culture, sound design, memory, and even mortality.\n\nI became determined to experience the game myself, which is easier said than done given that it was never released outside of Japan. I managed to find\n\n, translated by a fan, for the game\u2019s sequel Boku no Natsuyasumi 2: Umi no Bouken-hen (My Summer Vacation 2: Sea Adventure Chapter). The sequel, released two years after the original, also follows a boy named Boku vacationing in the countryside in August of 1975.\n\nArmed with the patch file, I needed 3 more items to complete my quest: a PS2 emulator, a PS2 BIOS (the software pre-installed on the console\u2019s chipset), and a copy of Boku no Natsuyasumi 2.\n\nLuckily, the emulator is easy to come by. I downloaded\n\n, which is an open source PS2 emulator that works quite well on my MacBook Air.\n\nUnfortunately, for Legal Reasons\u2122 I cannot provide a link to the PS2 BIOS or the the game itself, but a cursory Google search should turn up the files you need without too much trouble.\n\nWith these 4 talismans in hand I was able to perform the necessary ritual of resurrection: apply the English patch to the game, boot up the PS2 emulator, load the game.\n\nAfter a few clicks\u2026 paydirt.\n\nAn experienced gamer might find this process mundane, but to me it feels like the internet equivalent of breaking open an ancient, hidden tomb. At this point I could only imagine what treasures may lie within.\n\nWhat I discovered is undoubtedly a work of art, made clear by my time playing this iteration and from Tim\u2019s review of the original. The games also happen to be an example of the billions of bytes of lost media that are just waiting to be rediscovered by someone who will appreciate them.\n\nHere is a game, published 22 years ago, that has managed to evoke feelings of nostalgia and wistfulness in me today, in 2024. This must be the closest thing to time travel I\u2019ll ever experience.\n\nI knew lots about the game before playing due to Tim\u2019s review (which, again, is a 6 hour masterpiece), but there are two aspects I couldn\u2019t fully appreciate until playing: the game\u2019s backgrounds and soundscapes.\n\nFirst, the backgrounds. Bokunatsu makes use of a fixed perspective, where the camera only changes angles when the character moves to another scene. Each area that the user can move through is set upon a\n\nhand-painted background. If you\u2019ve ever seen a Miyazaki film you have a sense for the feelings that these backdrops create. A 3D modeled scene would never have evoked such a strong sense of place, time, and character, and the creative decision to use hand drawn backgrounds makes all the difference.\n\nThere\u2019s a narrative purpose to the backgrounds as well, signaling the time of day as they change throughout between different paintings for day, afternoon, and night.\n\nThe backgrounds were done by artists at an animation studio called Kusanagi.\n\n, but I heartily encourage you to browse through all of the art on their site.\n\nKazuo Oga is a famous background painter and the person responsible for many of the backgrounds in your favorite Miyazaki films.\n\n:\n\nThat\u2019s really the heart of it. Oga notices things \u2014 little things. He gets a feel for them. When he sits down to work, he brings with him all the unimportant details that matter the most. Then, with his paint, he creates an artwork that centers those details, elevates them. It\u2019s more a way of seeing and feeling than it is a technique.\n\nAll the unimportant details that matter the most\u2014paying attention to these details are precisely what make Bokunatsu, from its backgrounds to the narrative itself, so plainly striking.\n\nThe backgrounds are complimented by the soundscapes. These are, in my opinion, the best part of the game.\n\nOf all the characteristics of summer, it may be the sounds which I most associate with the season. I grew up in the rural south, and Bokunatsu manages to capture the droning sounds of summer in a way I\u2019ve never experienced before in media.\n\nAt times, I\u2019ve let the game run in the background just to listen to the soundscapes.\n\n, Sony sent a team into the mountains to capture sounds for the game.\n\nDear reader, I\u2019m here to tell you that the effort paid off.\n\nThe game\u2019s environment is alive with the sounds of insects chirping, the wind blowing through a nearby chime, the trickling of a nearby stream. As Boku explores the countryside time advances and, like the background art, the sounds change to evoke the feeling of morning, afternoon, and night.\n\nAnimal Crossing, which debuted the year after the original Boku no Natsuyasumi game, is held up as the shining example of cozy, relaxing video games. I am a true fan of the Animal Crossing franchise, but with its gameplay literally focused on grinding in order to pay your landlord they stand in stark comparison to a game like Bokunatsu. Animal Crossing rewards completionism, and in doing so makes the game about grinding instead of actually relaxing.\n\nIn comparison, the only thing you\u2019ll get for collecting all of the bugs or catching all of the fish in Boku is a diary entry written by the boy at night before bed. And, like in real life, maybe that\u2019s enough?\n\nDiscovering and playing Bokunatsu (and watching Tim\u2019s 6 hour magnum opus of a review) has given me a deep appreciation for the timelessness of art and media.\n\nA game from 24 years ago, deeply steeped in a culture that isn\u2019t my own, has managed to create in me a sense of warm nostalgia. Its soundscapes remind me of home, but also make me long for a place I\u2019ve never been.\n\nIt\u2019s\u00a0also worth appreciating the meta aspect of the journey I went on to discover and experience this game, all because of a link in a newsletter. This is why the web is so special, and it\u2019s what an AI will never do: unearth a lost gem.\n\nWhen writing in his diary at the end of each in-game day, Boku reflects on \u201cthe most wonderful day in which nothing happened.\u201d Let this be a reminder that there is magic waiting to be found in the mundane."}

So, as you can imagine, I read a\n\nof books, both with my mother and on my own. (I read through the complete unabridged Wizard of Oz series by myself in one summer when I was six.)\n\nI joined my first professional critique group when I was eight; I was told I'd be welcome to join, but they'd expect me to accept the same unvarnished feedback that any grown-up member would get, and to read their work and provide the same sort of honest feedback.

{"url": "https://dev.to/aspittel/what-productivity-looks-like-to-me-5dk5", "origin": "https://dev.to/aspittel", "title": "What Productivity Looks Like to Me - DEV Community", "content": "Posted on\n\n\u2022 Edited on\n\nFirst off, productivity is all about balance. You will not be fully productive if you don't take breaks, don't get enough sleep, or you don't take care of yourself. I do not work all the time whatsoever. I work a very standard 40 hour work week and then do 10-20 hours of side work per week. I do not do it all, I don't work non-stop, I'm not perfect.\n\nI also have a life that allows me to dedicate a lot to my side-work. I live with just my dog, I don't have children, I've been working remote for the last year and a half, and I've been single for most of my time doing side-work. I also am at a place in my career where putting in a 40 hour workweek most weeks at my day job is sufficient. It's a huge privilege that I'm able to be in the position that I am, and I know that my life will shift a lot in the future.\n\nEarly in my career, I worked a lot more than I do now -- I don't even want to do the math on how much, but it was a lot. I didn't have much balance in my life, and I let my social media-life consume me. I wanted to do it all, which wasn't possible. I ended up getting super burnt out, anxious, and unable to be as productive as I wanted to be. Balance is\n\nimportant. I can't overstate that enough. If you're dealing with burnout,\n\nwas a super helpful read to see how bad burnout can really become and how to be more balanced.\n\nI highly prioritize time with friends and family, runs with my dog, reading non-work related books, and being a total foodie in addition to my day job and the company I run. I am more than my work, and I don't want to lose my other identities.\n\nHere are some things that I've learned that help me be my most productive. This will look different for everybody, but I hope some of this is helpful.\n\nFirst off, take care of yourself. Sleeping the optimal amount for you will make you more alert and focused throughout the day. The same thing is true for drinking enough water. I also try to eat protein, fat, and carb balanced meals frequently throughout the day. I run most days and try to do other strength-based workouts too. Plus, I take a spa night on Sundays where I do face and hair masks and teeth whitening.\n\nDon't take health advice from me -- it's not what I do. Still, I do think prioritizing your health is one of the most important things you can do for your productivity and overall well-being.\n\nAs far as scheduling goes, I live by my Google Calendars. I put everything on there - I'm the person that sends my friends GCal invites for every hangout session. Otherwise, I'll forget. It's as simple as that.\n\nI have three calendars, one for my personal life, one for We Learn Code (my company), and one for my day job. Sometimes, I'll forward events to my personal calendar, so they're all in one place. If I'm super overwhelmed, I'll calendar block everything. So, I will have every minute of my day, even free time scheduled in. I don't do this often now, but it used to be really helpful for me to see my schedule upfront.\n\nNote: this was a week where I was in between jobs and had a lot I wanted to get done. I was also on vacation for the second half of the week.\n\nIn order to prioritize what I am going to work on, I first ask myself if it's something I'm passionate about. If it is, then I think about the time commitment and what I\n\nbe able to do if I decided to take on the new task. So, if I were to pick up a new freelance client, I would have to postpone working on an ebook, for example.\n\nMy greater goals and priorities have shifted over time. I initially wanted to build a bigger audience, and the activities I took on were correlated to that. Now, my financial situation has changed a bit, and I rely on my side-work being a larger portion of my income. In the future, I may prioritize more free time, which will change things again!\n\nTo help me prioritize, I use\n\nto track my time spent on every project I do -- not just paid ones. I'm even timing myself writing this post right now. I do this so that I can see where my time goes, which inefficiencies exist, and the payoff of each activity.\n\nFor example, here's my Toggl report for the week I'm writing this. Each of my projects is color-coded, and different views show my hours worked per day and listings of each activity by time.\n\nI also ask myself, \"What are the three most important things for me to get done?\". For my side work, I have three big to-do items for the week. For my day job, I do three per day. I use a pinned Google Keep sticky to keep track of these things, and I have another sticky with any time-sensitive tasks I need to do that day. Mostly things that won't take long, but need to get done then and there. Having just a few essential things to work on helps me to stay focused. I try to only work on what I've set out to do at the beginning of the week. I'm pretty dedicated to getting these few tasks done and worry a lot less about everything else.\n\nI read the book\n\nrecently. It got pretty repetitive at some points, but it does a great job at explaining how to prioritize and why prioritization matters so much. Just do what's essential, nothing more nothing less.\n\nAlso, I do not do it all myself. If there's something that makes sense for me to have someone else do, I will hire a service to handle those tasks. I do wash and fold for my laundry, I used to hire a cleaning service for my apartment, and a large portion of my diet is take-out. I'm in a privileged position to be able to outsource some of these pieces of my life, but it allows me to do more of the work that fires me up: teaching code.\n\nMotivation is also a challenging piece of doing side work, and I'm so imperfect at always being motivated. I give myself lots of breaks, and I remind myself that this I'm choosing to do. I do have some advice for getting and staying motivated.\n\nFirst, I love having groups of friends that I \"mastermind\" with. We inspire each other with our work, commiserate over the hard parts, and discuss strategies for growth. I love working with other people, and working on projects with other people or at least talking to them about those projects is a huge source of motivation for me.\n\nI also utilize the two-minute rule -- if something takes two minutes or less, I just have to get it done. Having one thing crossed off of my to-do list starts the ball rolling, and I usually get more done.\n\nSometimes, I set a timer and timebox how long I'll spend on something -- \"I don't feel like writing right now, but if I spend five minutes on it, I'll be closer to where I want to be.\" I rarely want to stop at the end of those five minutes, but it's a great trick for getting me started on something.\n\nI also am really motivated by finishing things -- leaving them half-done really bothers me. So I usually break tasks into smaller and smaller sub-tasks and focus on completing sub-tasks. This makes me feel more accomplished and like I'm making progress, so I'll be much less likely to abandon the project.\n\nOne of the most difficult things to handle when my social media following grew was the non-stop messages. From people requesting advice to spam to lovely comments about my work, I was all the sudden getting hundreds of communications a day. I receive, on average, 100 mentions on Twitter a day, 15-20 Twitter direct messages, and 50-70 emails. It's a lot.\n\nAt first, I would respond to everything. With a lot of thought and care -- essentially writing personalized blog posts for anyone who asked me a question. It wasn't scalable. I still feel some guilt, but I don't respond to everything anymore. I have so much content that's open to the public, which scales so much better than offering 1:1 advice. I also mute my own tweets after a little while if they get a lot of attention, and I have filters so I don't get any notifications from social media. I do, however, have Tweetdeck set up to show me all mentions and quote tweets so that I can quickly mass respond to people.\n\nI also have a system for my emails. I have three folders in my inboxes: today, this week, and this month. When an email comes in, I delete it or put it in one of these folders. I respond to\n\nemails every weekday,\n\nemails on Mondays, and\n\nemails at the end of the month. I also add emails that will take some time to my to-do list so that I can allot that time better. I'm also really interested in implementing\n\nemail system down the road. It seems awesome, it just takes some time to get used to.\n\nI take notes on\n\n. I take short-term notes that I won't keep forever in\n\n. Then I can archive stickies when I'm done with them. If they're something I want long term, I take notes in markdown and upload them to GitHub. I take notes during meetings I'm in, on books I read, on courses I take, etc. It's good for learning, and it gives me a synthesized version of the material to come back to.\n\nIf I have an idea for a project or a blog post, I write that thought down, otherwise, I'll forget it. I even have a notebook next to my bed for this reason!\n\nRelated to notes, I also have checklists for everything I do -- for blog posts before I publish, for recording Egghead videos, for my morning and evening routines, etc. Making a checklist makes it so I don't have to think, I can refer to the list. I am not very detail-oriented, so having the steps for something written out is so helpful, so I don't forget anything.\n\nMy morning and evening routines are all written in large text on a\n\non my fridge -- even just brushing my teeth is on there! I have my weekly workout schedule and chores list on there too.\n\nFor large projects, I usually use Trello to stay organized and motivated. I'll have checklists for each sub-task on each card. Breaking an enormous task into smaller ones helps me keep motivated and feel like I'm making progress.\n\nI've heard great things about\n\n, a book all about keeping checklists for everything. I haven't read the full text, but reading a summary of it inspired me to start creating these checklists.\n\nIf I can convince you to do one thing after reading this article, it would be to pick up\n\n. This book changed so much for me. Instead of focusing on goals, I try and focus on building up habits that make me who I want to become.\n\nI use\n\nhabit-tracker to keep track of habits I'm trying to build. Some things I have on there include: reading a chapter of a career-focused book each day, drinking enough water, and cleaning my apartment for at least 5 minutes. There's the immediate reward of having the habit change colors after it's completed, and there's an incentive to keep the habit chain going!\n\nAs far as file management goes, I keep everything on Google Drive. That way, if my laptop dies or something, I'll still have a backup. I also only keep files I'm using frequently on my computer to keep that organized. I have folders for projects and for life stuff! I also try to keep my personal and We Learn Code drives separate. Gotta keep work/side-hustle/life balance!\n\nI also keep my browser bookmarks super organized in folders. I only keep things I need, otherwise, I'll save links elsewhere -- like Pinterest or in my notes about something. Bookmarks are for links I frequently come back to. I also have a\n\nfolder filled with articles that I want to read. I try to allocate some time to get through these from time to time too!\n\nI think the term work-life balance is imperfect, but I work to make sure that I'm not working all the time. I'm someone who very much has a tendency to work a huge number of hours and to abandon other aspects of my life and health to do more work. This isn't good, and I actively work to not do this, especially since I have been much more prone to burnout recently.\n\nFirst of all, I don't have work email or Slack on my phone. I only have them on my work computer, which I don't touch outside of work hours.\n\nI also try to make my bedroom a technology-free zone. I will say this is\n\neasier when I'm not working from home -- quarantine has made this pretty much impossible. But, I find I sleep so much better if I put my phone and my computer in my living room before I sleep. I also think having dedicated workspaces when you do work from home is so helpful, and it's something I wish that I could more fully implement in my own life (darn city rent prices!).\n\nI am someone who works best without interruption and with long blocks of time. I don't do well with random 15-minute slots to work, rather I'd prefer to have one long afternoon to work. I used to do all of my blogging from the same restaurant in DC, Busboys and Poets. I'd go there every Sunday afternoon and crank out a post. Having that routine and that long block of time was perfect for me.\n\nI also work best in the afternoon as compared to mornings or nights, though in college, late nights were my everything. I usually do side work immediately after my normal workday ends and on weekend afternoons. Everyone is going to be so different with this -- experiment and find times that work best for you!\n\nI know that the\n\ntechnique works really well for some people, but I work best in long focused blocks. I tend to follow the\n\ninstead. I take breaks when I need to or when I finish a task, but frequent breaks aren't helpful for me, nor do I need them.\n\nSometimes, I have a tendency to get distracted. Especially by social media and the internet more generally. During times like that, I'll use the\n\napp to avoid distracting sites. Sometimes I'll even shut off the internet in my apartment if I really want to get some writing done.\n\nOne additional productivity system I find super helpful is batching. Batching is when you do a bunch of similar activities at once. So, for example, when I did Instagram I would write all my captions for the month at one time, and I'd pre-create graphics and find images. Or when I'm filming videos, I'll do multiple at once. When you're in one headspace it can be optimal to keep doing similar tasks instead of changing your focus to something else.\n\nhas some excellent content on why batching is so great.\n\nMy productivity system is just that --\n\nsystem. Don't feel like you need to adopt all of this or follow any of it. I just hope it's helpful to have a peek into my life and the things that help me. Remember -- balance is\n\nimportant and looks different for everyone. I'm so far from perfect, and I think it can seem like I do so much more than I actually do on social media. I am also in a place in my life where I can spend time on side-work, and I love doing it. Please let me know if you have any questions, or I can answer any questions on\n\n!\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nI'm going to give Toggl a try!\n\nThanks for the article <3\n\nDefinitely use Toggle! I recently started using it and loved it!\n\nsomeone with my style of productivity! Techniques like Pomodoro never made sense to me; I tend to zone into an activity for hours at a time before needing a break. I've been in a quarantine-induced rut lately, so something like Toggl and the \"Flowtime\" technique should definitely help with visualizing my todos day-to-day.\n\nA lot of gems in here. Bookmarking in case I need motivation in the future \ud83d\ude01\n\nVery cool your publication. I really liked Google Keep, it will help me a lot in the division between my school studies and computer technician studies and with my remote repository on GitHub, because sometimes I get very excited, I start coding at 8 am and I stop just for lunch, so I start again and so on until 4 in the morning. I completely forget that I need to study for the entrance exam to enter a university.\n\nI like your thoughts about concentration, reminds me of\n\nprinciples you can find in Cal Newport\u2019s book. I\u2019m just\n\nabout improving as a developer, and I put a big focus on productivity, with one chapter dedicated to deep work :)\n\nGreat article! It seems that you have been working on yourself for a long time and also observing and analyzing all the records and documents too. Just a guess though! I loved many short, sweet, straight but very effective sentences like whatever you have said in the very first paragraph and in the conclusion. Thanks for sharing what has worked for you! Kudos to your efforts... Have a productive day ahead... Keep shining, Keep inspiring \ud83d\ude03\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf8a\n\nHey guys, I have been working on my very first APIs project and in that project I'm making a \"QUIZ APP\", where from an API. I have been taking 10 question and giving them multiple choices and at end they will be getting scored. I'm using NODE.JS, EXPRESS, REQUEST, EJS for the app.\n\nThe problem comes here when i get a string from API. I change it to an object using JSON.parse() and sending it to EJS files and then displayed. but when their are symbols in question like \", ' , and more they are displayed as &139; , \" like that.\n\nAlways interesting to read others' routines. I've recently added kaizen to my workflow, meaning that I look for a small step to improve a process every day. It had the most impact on my personal life so far. For example, yesterday I improved the way I prepare avocado for eating (there's a better way to deal with kernels than what I had been doing). I got the ideas from\n\n.\n\nAnother tool that I use in a similar way to the flowtime technique is RescueTime checking the report from time to time to see in which categories I was working on and how the time was spent.\n\nI have tried Pomodoro technique and I am on the same page as you that I don't need breaks too often. Will try to understand what is Flowtime, thanks for sharing this \ud83d\udc4d\n\nnote taking and scheduling has always seemed as a work itself...\n\ni guess it takes practice to implement it as a daily habit :)\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

I'm an extrovert, and the social environment at work helps to motivate me and get me through the day. That being said, due to COVID and the evolving nature of tech work, I've been working remote for almost two years. There are a lot of benefits to it, like no commute time, the ability to live wherever, more flexibility, and accessibility. Also, I know it's a huge privilege to be able to work remote during this time, and so few of my non-tech friends have that ability. But, for me, working remote doesn't come naturally. So, I wanted to write down my strategies for making it as enjoyable as possible.\n\nI also want to note before starting that right now many of us are working through the stress of a pandemic, shifting to new modalities at work, struggling with economic instability and unemployment, shifting childcare responsibilities, and dealing with health concerns for ourselves and our families. None of this is normal, make sure to take time for yourself and it's okay to not be okay.\n\nThis may sound super corny, but mentally having some sort of \"commute\" to work in the morning and after work in the evening creates some separation in your day. I have a dog, which makes this even easier -- I walk her at the beginning of the day before work and then take her to the park at the end of the day. I also have time to sneak in a bit of a podcast or an audiobook too.\n\nWhen I started working remote, I lived alone. It made work from home really hard because if I didn't actively make plans, I could go days without talking to another human. Earlier this year, I moved in with my partner. Now, I am guaranteed to talk to someone pretty much every day, and I feel much less isolated.\n\nEven if living with another person isn't a reality, having a pet really helps. Having Blair, my dog, makes me get out of the house, and I still have someone with me all day, even if she isn't human. I get cuddles during my breaks, and I even sometimes get a ball thrown at me!\n\nWhen I started working remote, I lived in an apartment that had essentially been my crash pad before. It was in a perfect location, but wasn't very large and was very old -- it didn't even have a real kitchen! I worked out of a desk in my bedroom. So, I was pretty much in that room for 22+ hours a day. It wasn't great for me mentally to not have a separate workspace, and there wasn't much separation between my work and the rest of my life. I know it isn't realistic for everyone, especially those with families or who live in cities with high rent and low square footage, but having a dedicated workspace that you can close off at the end of the day is\n\nand helps you really separate work and the rest of your life.\n\nEarlier this year when the pandemic hit, I lived in a very old studio apartment in NYC, and while it was in the perfect location, it also had a horrible mouse problem, the temperature was always off, and I was pretty much in the same room 24 hours a day. It was miserable.\n\nMoving out of that environment has made working from home much more bearable. Especially since my company has a work from home budget. Getting a comfortable chair, a monitor setup that works for me, and customizations that fit my personality make my workday so much more enjoyable. It has also become a lot more important for me to live in a nice space, and instead of prioritizing living close to work or right downtown, I'm more concerned with living somewhere that's updated, doesn't have a lot of issues, and has space to move around.\n\nEven though I think it's really helpful to have a dedicated workspace, I also move throughout my apartment throughout the day. I do a few hours of work at my desk, then take calls from the couch or the dining room table if I don't need a monitor. It's nice to change the scenery and have a different chair at some point in the day. It helps me re-focus as the day goes on.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of working in an office is the ability to grab or eat lunch with work friends each day. Something I do at least once a week is schedule a lunchtime video call with a friend, whether they are inside of my company or external. It really breaks up the day, recharges me, and keeps those connections intact.\n\nOne of the really nice parts of working remote is that other than calls, you can normally schedule your day to fit your schedule and how you work best rather than being standardized to a 9-5. I often read the advice to always get ready for work. I instead normally put on makeup and get dressed nicely mid-day when I don't have early meetings. I also sometimes take runs during my lunch break, and I often work a 7-3 or 8-4 day instead of 9-5. Use the flexibility to your advantage and work a schedule that fits your needs.\n\nThis is much less relevant now since there's a pandemic going on, but I think it's so important to still socialize with friends and do things outside of your house. It can be tempting to become a hermit since you have to actively leave your house to do things after work, but you still need social interaction and to experience life outside your living space. I find making plans with friends makes me more accountable and likely to do things. Even now, setting up virtual or park hangouts adds some variety to the day!\n\nThis is, again, more of a post-pandemic recommendation, but before COVID I used to do co-working days with friends who also work remote. I would either have them over, or we would meet at a coffee shop and we would work together on each of our work tasks. It's a great opportunity to catch up and have the opportunity to have someone to chat with throughout the day.\n\nOne of the things I miss most about working in an office is unstructured discussion time with colleagues. Most remote calls have a structure and an agenda, but so much valuable brainstorming comes from free-flowing discussions. On past teams, we've scheduled watercooler time or virtual team happy hours, and it's been great to get to know one another and come up with ideas.\n\nEven though most things are remote now, having a community who understands what you do and who you can learn from is so important. I love so many Discord and Slack groups in addition to public forums like DEV and Twitter. They allow me to stay involved with the larger developer community.\n\nRemote work is an increasing piece of work in tech, and I know that it's a really amazing thing for a lot of people, especially parents and those who are disabled. There are many nice pieces of it, like being able to live wherever, no commute times, and the flexibility. That being said, the decrease in work/life separation and the decrease in social time also makes it difficult. Also, this year we aren't just working remote, we are working during a pandemic -- and many people have additional responsibilities as a result. I hope these tips are helpful!\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nI think it's a very important article! Not everyone will be naturally prone to working remote. One thing I have been thinking about lately is how to foster a remote company culture that is actually fun to work in? Remote video calls are good but there's no substitute for face to face interactions (yet). In the remote community there's been so much focus on co-workers who don't like each other and they are forced into an office, watercooler drama, etc. but what about if the co-workers are kickass and it's a genuine fun experience to interact.\n\nalso I was wondering: how to make remote video lunches not turn into some kind of weird live ASMR session ? \ud83e\udd23\n\nYeah I guess everything has pros and cons. Personally I like remote work, even before everyone was forced to. So I already made sure my work space is very nice.\n\nI think it's important to be disciplined and be good at planning if you work from home, otherwise there is no routine and boundaries. Also, for parents I think it's extra challenge, especially if they have limited space. But perhaps WFH also allows people to move to suburb or smaller and less expensive city/town, so they can actually afford better living standard.\n\nAnyone have a link to that wallpaper \ud83d\udc40\n\nYes!\n\nThank you!! \ud83d\udc95\n\nExcellent advice. I've done a lot of these same things for most of my career (which has been 95% WFH self-employment).\n\nI will add, I suggest finding a group of friends that can do social time on video calls of some kind. I've been seriously considering an early morning \"Coffe with Seth\" type stuff to give other early birds like me someone to chit chat with about work stuff, or to just shoot the breeze at a regularly scheduled time.\n\nI've actually found myself really engaged with streamers when I never was before. That can be a lot of fun to find a small streamer and get to interact with whatever they are doing. I enjoy being helpful when I can.\n\nThanks for this post! Although I am not an extrovert, I\u2019m way on the opposite end it is important to be mindful of how we are spending our days now. It\u2019s been a real balance trying to make sure I stay healthy mentally and not fall into becoming a hermit. I have resorted to forming a pod with basically my partner and housemates and that has been super helpful to stay active.\n\nis that 13\" mac comfortable to work for you? I previously tried to work on it on a previous job, but without an external monitor it was horrible, such a small screen to work. Never considered a 16\" instead of this one? Or mobility is your top priority there?\n\nGreat post Ali\n\nThanks for this!! Having a separate place to work and pets really help\n\nYES, I agree with all those great ideas.\n\nMy FAV; Get out of the house! Feeling pent up? For people with yards or front porches, just sit outside for 5 minutes. Get that Vitamin D!\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

In a recent\n\n, we discussed computer science degrees, bootcamps, and self-directed learning. Each has benefits and have brought a lot of people into the world of programming. Each also has challenges. All four of us have had unique paths to programming, so here are our stories.\n\nI was a biology major in college and then quickly realized that I was terrible at it. So, I switched to actuarial science where I took an intro to computer science course and totally fell in love with binary, hexadecimal, and octal systems. The rest is really history. I studied computer science and my first language was Java. I was a little bit of a late bloomer but I thoroughly enjoy it.\n\nI got started when I was 11 years old. I wanted to build my own community on Neopets. If you\u2019re not familiar with what Neopets is, it\u2019s this Web site where you can have your own virtual pet and you can feed it and play games. You can have your own communities and all kinds of stuff.\n\nI really wanted to build my own community and customize it. But you need to know how to code to do that. So, I asked my dad for an HTML book and my first book was HTML goodies. I thought it was awesome and a lot of fun.\n\nFast forward to high school, and I took AP Computer Science. My first language in high school was Java, and I was so bad at it that I needed a tutor just to pass the class. I was like \"I\u2019m never going to do this ever.\" But, you know, obviously, 17 years later and I\u2019m very clearly still coding, so something eventually clicked but it wasn\u2019t Java.\n\nI was an admin assistant really aimlessly going through my job; I was miserable. My dad suggested coding to me and was like \"worst case scenario if you hate it you could try something else.\"\n\nSo, he bought me an \u201dIntroduction to Drupal\u201d book and \u2013 quite frankly, I do not recommend starting out as Drupal when you\u2019re learning to code but that\u2019s how I did. I just continue learning, continue working in the mornings before work. Then I got my first Drupal job.\n\nA few years into that I started learning about accessibility. Then a year or so after that I started learning about React and VueJS and I\u2019m now a React developer and the rest is kind of history.\n\nI learned to code when I was a sophomore in college. I had no idea what coding even was, but I had an extra course block available. I decided to sign up for it because people kept telling me, \u201dIt\u2019s a good thing to learn and it\u2019ll help you no matter what.\u201d\n\nI honestly thought that I was going to be learning how to format Word documents or something like that - I had no idea what code was. But, I was instead writing Python. It was super fun: we were building games. I just thought it was magical how you could put stuff together and have a program come out of it.\n\nI completely reconfigured my schedule and was like I\u2019m going to double major in computer science, this is my future. So, I started my second class which was in C++ and it was a super intense \"Data Structures and Algorithms\" class, which was also a weed out class. I was pulling all-nighters and working so hard in that class just to understand it. I did come out of it with a good grade. I thought \"if I have to work this hard for it, it means that I\u2019m not good enough at it. This is really just not for me.\"\n\nThen when I was a Junior in college I had an internship doing mostly Excel data analysis type work, and I figured out that I could automate a lot of my own job using the Python skills that I had. So, from there, I got a software engineering internship and transitioned to working full time in code.\n\nYou can listen to the\n\nwhere we discussed our thoughts on bootcamps, computer science degrees, and self-directed learning as well as advice for everyone in the midst of their journies.\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nI love origin stories!\n\nI think the major takeaway is that it doesn't matter how you get started - just get started, and keep going.  Each of your backgrounds is so different; it's a testament to the fact that there is no one 'right' way to get started.  Just find something you like doing - and keep doing that.\n\nThanks for sharing!\n\nI love hearing \"where did you fell in love with computers\" stories \ud83e\udd29\n\nKeep rocking!\n\nLoved Lindsey\u2019s story, my first job was as a Drupal developer! I feel your pain. Love this.\n\nStrong women \ud83d\udcaa\n\ndoes it have a caption? I knew it's excessive asking...\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

{"url": "https://dev.to/ladybug/thoughts-on-being-a-digital-nomad-55i6", "origin": "https://dev.to/aspittel", "title": "Thoughts on Being a Digital Nomad - DEV Community", "content": "Posted on\n\n\u2022 Originally published at\n\nAlmost two years ago, I donated almost everything I owned and left DC. I was at a job that wasn't the right fit for me, and I didn't know my future. I decided that rather than signing a new lease, I'd instead mostly live at tech conferences for the summer and crash at my parents' in between, and then start living out of AirBnBs in the Fall. I ended up retiring from the digital nomad lifestyle in order to work in an office gain (which started 3 days before the COVID shutdown \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f). That being said, I think this is a pretty unique experience, but more people may be able to do the same as remote work becomes more popular and (hopefully) the pandemic starts to subside. So, I wanted to write down my thoughts and advice on the experience.\n\nI personally chose to live out of AirBnBs. The longer you book a place, the more discount you get normally. So, I'd book a place for a month at a time. The cost for AirBnB pluses ended up being less than my DC rent most months. The van life idea is so appealing to me, but the mechanical knowledge needed and the potential lack of internet intimidates me. I also personally stayed in the United States because of my dog, I didn't want to quarantine her which you need to do with most international countries.\n\nI travelled from city to city in my car, which was super nice. I was able to visit a bunch of sites nearby cities instead of just staying downtown, which I may have had to without a car.\n\nI chose cities by expense, activities available, and their proximity to National Parks. My biggest bucket list item is to visit all of the National Parks, so this very much helped in that goal. I loved being able to experience different areas, taste test different restaurants, and to never get bored of my surroundings. I also was using it as a way to vet cities before settling down -- I didn't know where I wanted to move longterm, so this was a way of trying out different cities.\n\nTaxes can get\n\ncomplicated if you're moving around a bunch, especially if you move internationally or are self-employed (or just have side gigs like me). I hired an accountant who specializes in digital nomads, and it's such a weight off my chest.\n\nis his site in case you're interested.\n\nThere were two really difficult attributes of travel for me: the first was loneliness, the second was the lack of a routine. It's pretty tough to get to know people when you aren't staying in a city for long. Something I would probably prioritize if I did this again would be to go to cities with a big tech scene so I could go to meetups and potentially speak at them. I was also single at the time, so doing this with a partner or a family would probably help in that regard. As far as having a routine, I was changing where I lived every month. So it's difficult to get too settled. Part of that was nice, I would go on hikes every morning with my dog in Asheville and would go to a neighborhood coffee shop in Nashville. But, I definitely missed having a set workday schedule.\n\nOverall, it's an experience I really enjoyed and would highly recommend if your work and life situations allow it. I would probably go back to being a digital nomad once the country re-opens and my partner was able to work remote. If you're interested in moving internationally,\n\nthis Ladybug episode. Please\n\nany questions to me, I'd love to help out!\n\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\n\nThis is exactly what I would like to do but kinda afraid to take the plunge. I too had a plan to visit different cities and just go to tech conferences and meetups but I\u2019m unsure if I should without a car and use public transport or not. Also I am a freelancer so it\u2019s feast or famine when it comes to money.\n\nCosmic timing Ali ! I\u2019m about to do this my self.. I\u2019ve been at a job that allows me to do this for about a year now , and my lease is up in July , so as soon as it is , I want to sell all my stuff and do it while I\u2019m still single and not having kids\n\nThank you so much for the heads up , in regards to loneliness and lack of routing - being a creature of habit I think I too would seriously miss this aspect Of everyday existence the most  ...\n\nPerHaps if I stayed longer than a month , like at least 3 at a time , it would enough to feel settled in .\n\nAnd to combat loneliness - I am pretty violently extroverted and usually end up making friends wherever I go .. just difficult when they don\u2019t speak English .\n\nAwesome! Yeah, hopefully by then things will be more open and you can go to events. I think that will be really helpful :)\n\nReally cool to share this experience! I would love to do something similar in Europe but am always a bit scared about the lack of routine and how hard would it be to meet people and build relationships in short term.\n\nThis post inspired me though! Thank you\n\nWhat if you are planning this in the country where you live right now.?\n\nI would be less scared if I plan it \"smaller\".\n\nAnd probably you already will get some good experience and confidence to do it in the whole Europe.\n\nThat is also a valid idea :) I am living in Austria currently, so small country if compared to where I come from, but still there are other cities where would be cool to live for a while!\n\nNeat! Thanks for sharing, especially the accountant bit!\n\nWe plan to launch in 2023. I joined a community called\n\nlast year, and I'll be keeping my membership up until the big day because there is just so much to learn! There are people in this community that do it with AirBnB like you. One of the other benefits is the private small groups in the community, such as the one for IT Professionals.\n\nStarlink will be in full swing by then, so hopefully we'll be more connected than ever so that we can be more disconnected than ever. Wrap your mind around that!\n\nOne of the things you said really stood out to me, and that was your comment about DC rent. In Annapolis we are are shelling out $3,700 a month between childcare and rent, and I didn't know how well that would prepare me for places like Norway which famously costs you about $25-35 dollars for fish and chips and a pint. Cool, we do that, too!\n\nIt comes up a lot in the group, because there is someone experiencing the digital nomad life at every level from financially independent to the most frugal families you've ever met. The first question I asked was whether or not I was ridiculous for wanting a 5th wheel for the three of us when there are people cramming 12 into a vintage Airstream, and I found that it's all about what is comfortable for you. It set me at ease. This is going to be our home for a few years while we are roadschooling/unschooling, after all.\n\nOh, and national parks are high on our list, too. \ud83d\ude04 I want to fill out one of the passports.\n\nWow, that sounds awesome!\n\nI consider every now and then to \"travel\" around the UK.\n\nAs I am not working in IT yet, my plan is/was to apply a global company which has stores around the country, so I can transfer myself between stores/businesses.  So, I would spend 2-5 months in each city on my list, keep working so I have income and the same time I explore everything in my free time.\n\nAs I came from another country without partner or family member, I already have experience how to spend my free time without feeling alone or lonely.\n\nThere are some really cool meetups and activity groups around the country which I would love to visit.\n\nWhat a cool goal you had! Staying nearby National Parks! If the possibility to work remotely stays in my company, I'd also consider moving closer to the mountains.\n\nThanks for sharing, Ali! I'm planning to be a digital nomad from next year first locally (in my country) and then internationally for the next few years.\n\nIt sounds exciting. Where would you like to go? Which cities are on your list?\n\nWe are planning to do the same next year, but go around Europe and Asia - I will document our adventures as digital nomads :)\n\nWhat a wonderful way to work, Id welcome the private time and time for me. That sounds like a bucket list item I may need to add.\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

Writing articles; making videos; released my first course early this year :D\n\nI want to be what I am now...\n\n...but perhaps making enough money to survive. :)\n\nTo summarize, I'm a writer, programmer, cook, interviewer, poet, musician, masseur, coach, speaker, and more. I've got a million projects on the go at all times. I traded stability for chaos, and I love it, except for the financial part now.\n\nI don't mix with grown up careers well. :)\n\nThat is so freaking cool -- sounds like a dream to be able to combine all of your interests! I'm sure you'll figure out the income part -- you are so talented at so much!\n\nReally\n\nHow can one be all this things\n\nYou try to juggle. Many things will fall and break. But you keep adding more. Eventually some things will stay in the air.\n\nI want to be a person who is present for the ones that I love. I've been thinking about this a lot lately. There are so many elements to that goal: health, financial stability, work-life balance, etc.\n\nI can relate to that very much. And it\u2019s not easy to balance the factors, I feel.\n\nI also want to be who I am suppose to be. Though my description of \"who I suppose to be\" is different from what people expect of me.\n\nI want to be close to my family, friends and who I see important.\n\nTo point to a semi-fictional archetype I would be happy to aspire to:\n\nBrad Pitt's character in The Big Short.\n\nThis is probably odd because it is really a sad story full of sad people and Pitt's character may be the most honestly sad of all (sad in terms of emotions).\n\nHopefully I can accomplish this while staying happy and optimistic, but that character really understood how the world worked, he lived in a beautiful mountainous location and was there for mentees when they needed him (even if he was a bit grumpy along the way).\n\nWhen designing my\n\n, I think about that character. I can tell I am going in that direction and I hope I can continue to achieve the good parts of that situation.\n\nAlong these lines, I really appreciated this post:\n\nWe humans must find a certain contentment in whatever situation we find ourselves in, but in terms of situations to position one's self to be in. This is my line of thinking. \ud83d\ude42\n\nLoved that article, really thoughtful... Thanks Ben!\n\nWould you mind sharing the results of the last six months of your experience after commenting on the article?\n\nWhen I was around 12-13 I always imagined myself at 25 with my own apartment, at the pool with a margarita. I'm 26 and I don't have any of that ; ----;\n\nBut I still want to grow up into that image, but with the added bonus that the pool and apartment are in my personal island. B3\n\nI'm about to turn 28 and am in same position...no house, credit is a dumpster fire (but have a subprime auto loan on a badass sports car!) and I'm watching all my friends get married and settle down with kids and I am nowhere near any of that...I just keep hoping one of my random startup ideas finally pans out and I can sell out and live a more stable life...maybe next year\n\nWhat did I want to be (before the harsh realities of life)?\n\n...A meteorologist. (Damn you university calculus for crushing the dream!)\n\nToday, what do I want to be when I \"grow up\" (aka retire)?\n\nI'd like to buy a mini-excavator and dig holes for pocket money! :)\n\nI want to enjoy a more balanced life and have more saying in what i put my time and energy into. That means, being part of a team that creates and sustains something actually useful and having my free time and enjoying life more.\n\nI love this idea, maybe call it 'caffeine commit'\n\nI just wanna simply sit somewhere watching my family having fun\n\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

It was a nice sunny day, hopped on the early 7:45 train to Hope,\n\n. Little did I know that was the start of my new hobby and passion, hiking; as I recently went to Peak District again, done\n\nand the\n\ntrails. More on this down bellow.\n\nI tried to cover the most important aspects of my trip, but hiking is all about the moment and the experience. Hard to put into words the beauty of nature.\n\nBy far the best thing about going away from the day to day city craze, was the silence. After the train left the station, all I could hear was \u2026 nothing. Pure silence. It then occurred to me, that I have\n\nsomething, in a very long time. I had forgotten what silence was; the pure tranquility sensation.\n\nOn the first Hike, I did the climb to Ladybower Dam and got to see quite a bit of nature, the rural areas around Hope and saw how friendly outdoorsy people are. Everyone would salute you and people were more than eager to give directions and help you.\n\nAfter the rather easy hike to the dam, I went up to Win hill, where the view was very rewarding, as the climb is on some steep rocks trough a forested area with a stream of water on the side. From the peak you could see all around the valley and could even see the dam. The walk back down was much easier and quicker as it followed a path down and around the hill instead of climbing rocks.\n\nI would say that the first hiking experience wasn\u2019t that eventful, but nonetheless it was a special moment and the start of something beautiful.\n\nThis took place mid October on a cloudy day with some light rain. The hike was considerably longer than the first one (10km), and this time it involved walking across the peaks of Loose Hill. The view was nice, but due to the clouds and fog, visibility was limited.\n\nThe best part of this hike was the end destination, and what would end up becoming my new post-hike\n\n.\n\nA nice cozy place, right next to Edale Station. The staff there are like a big family, they\u2019re friendly and warm. The decor of the restaurant is homy and the food is just what you need after a long hike. On Sunday they have roast (pork or beef) with veggies and Yorkshire pudding. They also sell local ales (which are some of the best and most refreshing beers I\u2019ve had). To get an idea of how good the beer is, I asked if they sell bottles of the stuff (sadly no), so next time I\u2019ll see if I can bring my own bottle \ud83c\udf7a.\n\nThey are welcoming people, \u201cmuddy boots are welcome\u201d and \u201cdogs are welcome\u201d.\n\nLast weekend I spontaneously decided to go hiking again. I simply craved it, weather was good (by UK standards) and train tickets were still cheap. So I did it. Since my last hike I even invested in a hydration pack and some light, foldable, and strong hiking poles (which came in handy!).\n\nThe hike started off with a superb walk above a brook, trees with red, orange and yellow leaves, you get to cross a couple of rustic looking wooden bridges. The brooks valley even gets narrower and the hills on both sides are quite steep, giving an amazing feel when walking between em.\n\nAbout 2km in, the hike transforms into a little bit of a climb. The path becomes one with the brook and you have to carefully navigate your way from rock to rock on the brook. Then the elevation begins to take off, you start climbing up some rocks, with the brook still there. Making this a treacherous climb where one must be very confident in every move. The climb is about 1km with an elevation gain of 500m. For me that\u2019s the steepest path I had to take so far, but the climb is full of breathtaking scenery and as you go higher you get to see more and more of where you came from.\n\nUpon reaching the peak, you realise it\u2019s actually a plateau and you can see the entire valley where you walked. A little further in, most people will proceed to climb to an even higher peak, but not me. My trail map said\n\nand so I did.\n\nWhat was I expecting? From the map, I knew the trail would pass trough the\n\n. I expected a nice area, abundant in vegetation and tall trees, you know\n\n.\n\nWhat did I get?\n\nThe path I followed (at this point alone, as everybody else would go in the opposite direction) was next to a water stream and as such the ground was rather muddy and soft. Then the trail map said\n\nand so I did. After a while I found myself in a rather muddy area, with no visible path and no obvious direction to follow. The sun was still out and I was about 1/3 of the trail in so I pushed forward.\n\nAfter a kilometre of walking trough some rather shitty conditions (mud and weird terrain), fog set in out of a sudden; combined with the lack of a path and the only direction I knew being\n\n, I pushed on like any sane person would do.\n\nNot 5 minutes later I was in the middle of a post-apocalyptic scenario. Fog everywhere, terrain at this point was composed of\n\ncombined with\n\nand\n\n.\n\nThis is when it hit me. I am in a swamp.\n\nThere were many questions going on in my head at the time:\n\nI realised that I might not have the time (sunset was 2-3 hours away) to juggle around the terrain of the swamp, so I took a split second decision and I started going\n\nin the hopes of intersecting with the public footpath sooner rather than later.\n\nAfter adventuring trough the swamp like a mad man, trying to reach some solid ground. Getting mud all over my boots and pants, finding a rather suspicious metal box under some rocks and getting bad looks from frogs, I eventually got out of the fog, away from the mud and reached the Pennine footpath where I slowly walked my way back to Edale.\n\nIt was definitely an experience that I will not forget. And honestly I would do it again, this time going trough the entire swamp and maybe even see\n\n.\n\nI didn\u2019t cover the entire trip, there were other sights to see, like Jacob\u2019s ladder and the High Peak area.\n\nMore hiking stories to come (with full HD videos of the entire trip)."}

I hacked into their computer and captured the USB traffic on it. Could you help me steal the secret?\n\nFlag format: flag{0-9a-z_} (Convert uppercase to lowercase)\n\nAttachments:\n\nFor this challenge, we are given a pcapng that contains USB protocol packets.\n\nMost of the packets are input packets labeled as\n\nby wireshark. There are, however, a few exceptions:\n\nThis packet and the one below it caught my attention because they are both output packets and contains ascii characters that resemble some sort of programming language.\n\nI copied one of the lines and did a quick google search.\n\nis what I found - a TSPL/TSPL2 Programming Language manual. Just like how 3d printers are controlled using G-code, it seems like that printers also have their own programming language.\n\nHere are the commands within the two packets:\n\nThe second packet seems to be the one that actually draws out the flag using two different commands:\n\nand\n\n. Now, I just have to implement the two commands in python and get the flag.\n\nHere is the code for that:\n\nIn the end, we get an image with the flag:\n\nflag:\n\nwho likes singing, dancing, rapping and shell-coding?\n\nThe directories on the server looks something like this:\n\nnc 139.180.215.222 20002\n\nnc 106.52.252.82 20002\n\nAttachments:\n\nAfter a quick analysis of the binary given, we see that the binary reads in 7 bytes of data, zero out most of the registers, and executes the data as shellcode.\n\n7-byte is not a lot. The\n\ninstruction itself takes up 2 bytes. Due to this size limitation, I decided to go with a two-stage approach. First, I will craft a 7-byte payload that will make a read syscall and read in a second stage payload. Second, I will craft a second stage payload that is more than 7 bytes and perform whatever task I want without worrying about any size limitations.\n\nI ran the binary in gdb just to see the state of the registers when our shellcode is being called. This is helpful as it allows us to utilize some of the existing register values:\n\nAs you can see, there\u2019s not a lot to work with, but we do have the address of the current buffer loaded in rdi.\n\nIn order to make the read syscall, we need four things:\n\nWe know that the syscall itself takes up 2 bytes and copying the address of the current buffer from rdi to rsi takes at least 2 bytes. This leaves us 3 bytes to zero out rdi and make rdx a large number:\n\nMy first idea was to move the address of the current buffer to rdx as it is quite a large number; however, it turns out to be too large and would not work.\n\nLooking for inspiration, I came across\n\n. Although it is written for 32 bit instead of 64 bit, it is still quite useful and helped me came up with my final payload:\n\nThis payload only uses 6 bytes of space! It relayed on the fact that\n\nis a single byte instruction, and due to its 32 bit nature, the current address is truncated to only 4 bytes before being loaded into rdx.\n\nNow, we successfully bypassed the size limitation and can run whatever code we want; however, the execve syscall seems to be blocked on the server. Bummer!\n\nBut we can still do an open/read/write to get the flag right? Well, now is a good time to review the challenge description:\n\nThe directories on the server looks something like this:\n\nAs you can see, the flag is hidden in a nested folder, and we need a way to find the path for the flag file.\n\nBasically, we need a way to list the content in a given directory. The first thing that came to me was the\n\ncommand, so I ran a strace on it:\n\nAll that we need is two syscalls:\n\nwhich opens a file descriptor for a given path and\n\nwhich list out the content of a directory.\n\nWith the help of the shellcraft module in pwntools, I quickly created a payload that can read out the content of a given directory:\n\nAnother minor inconvenience is the fact that the\n\nsyscall returns a linux_dirent struct for each file which needs to be parsed. Lucky, we can do that on the client side with python instead of parsing it with assembly:\n\nNow, with the ability to list all files in a given directory, we just need a program to recursively go through all the folders and find the flag file.\n\nBecause the server always timeouts before the flag file can be found, I also added the functionality to preserve progress so that I can get the path using multiple sessions.\n\nHere is the final code:\n\nWith this code, I found the flag file located at\n\n.\n\nNow with a simple payload, we can read out the flag:\n\nflag:"}

Not many Romanians know about it. It\u2019s more of a regional thing. The people who would cook and eat \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie used to be shepherds. It\u2019s also possible that other cultures have a similar dish but I haven\u2019t yet met someone from outside my family that can describe anything similar to \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie.\n\n\u021a\u0103c\u0103lie is rich in calories and fat and it\u2019s best served hot. The caloric value it offers is extremely important for people like shepherds because of the long hours on the cold mountains. The ingredients and method of making \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie are also accessible. All they\u2019d have to do is carry a chunk of pig fat, some bread and an onion, then make a little fire.\n\nFor me \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie used to be a normal thing, whenever we\u2019d have a family BBQ, \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie was the first thing we made. I really enjoyed it as a kid and took years to learn the proper way of cooking it. Anybody can easily cook \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie but it takes multiple attempts to get all the little details right and perfect your method. This will only lead to the best of \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie, so well cooked that angles will weep for a taste of it.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until high school and talking with some friends that I realised I am the only one who knows about \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie.\n\nI cooked some \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie for some friends of mine and some couldn\u2019t even dare taste it. For some it is\n\nextremely heavy (you\u2019ll understand why shortly).\n\nWarning: Vegans and vegetarians will flee when exposed to \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie\n\n(pig fat with rind, Romanians call it\n\n)\n\nFor cooking you\u2019ll also need a stick (size matters, anything between 30-50cm should be good enough). Make sure the stick is strong enough to hold the chunk of pig fat and not too dry (spoiler alert, it all goes above a fire).\n\nWarning: Do not use a metal stick, the pig fat will slide right out after heating up. I recommend a cherry tree branch with a sharpened tip.\n\nTo get things started slightly cut your pig fat on all sides (excluding the skin side). Do not make the cuts too deep, as it could make it fall apart later. We do this to allow for better and more evenly cooking.\n\nNow cut the bread (slices, about 1cm thick, you can do thicker slices if you feel \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie is too heavy for you) and onion (any shape or size you like, I prefer rings). Place the onions slices/rings on the slices of bread and set everything near your grill.\n\nAt this point you should start your fire. Do not let the flame burn out, \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie is cooked using the flame not active charcoal. Take your stick and put the tip of it inside the fire (enough to chahr it, but don\u2019t set it on fire). Stick your chunk of pig fat on the stick.\n\nThis bit might sound easy but it\u2019s quite tricky to get it right. At this point you should have your chunk of slan\u0103 on the stick, your fire is roaring and the bread with onions is nearby.\n\nRepeat this process until each slice is covered in as much fat as you wish (see final product bellow for reference).\n\nTip: You can use some of the dripping fat to keep the fire alive or to extend it to new sections of the BBQ, thus ensuring you equally activate your charcoal.\n\nTip: When dripping fat on the bread, feel free to slowly and gently press the slan\u0103 on the bread.\n\nMaster tip: Sometimes the tip of your stick will set on fire.\n\n, this is the best thing that could happen but be careful. You can now tilt your stick with the tip facing almost completely down. Keep the stick above the bread and watch how the tiny flame will make the pig fat drip.\n\nAfter doing the above\n\na couple of times you will notice the exterior of the pig fat is cooked, at this point set it near your bread and start cutting the outer layer, revealing more raw uncooked pig fat ready for roasting.\n\nThe cooked fat is placed on top of the bread for added unhealthy pure tastiness.\n\nTip: At the point when you start cutting the first layer of cooked slan\u0103, you might want to take a short break and eat a slice, as \u021a\u0103c\u0103lie is best served hot. Reheating it is an option.\n\nNote: After cutting outer layers, make sure to make some more cuts on the surface to allow for more fat dripping and better roasting.\n\nAgain, repeat the above until all pig fat is cooked. Depending on the rind you have, it may be easy to bite trough and crunchy or extremely tough. It is comestible tho and I personally enjoy it.\n\nThis is how the final product should look like:\n\nIf you weren\u2019t disgusted by possibly the most unhealthy edible thing you\u2019ve ever heard, then you should know a couple of things."}

But, for some, maybe being able to stick to the timeline might just be the fun that is added to life. Being able to sleep on time and wake up a fresh man every other day is just what you find fun in.

It all started back in mid-2013 when my twitter stream and facebook newsfeed was filled with status-es like \u201cIt\u2019s official, you\u2019re invited! Yay!\u201d and there in my mailbox was an unread email with the same subject. Yes, It was official and I was invited too :D. It was an invitation to attend the Mozilla Summit 2013 to be hosted simulatneously in 3 cities (Brussels, Toronto and Santa-Clara) and with the mission for (almost) all mozillians to come together, get inspired, talk and shape the future of the open web.\n\nFast forward to October 2013, after a flight from Munich via Amsterdam, I was standing in front of the Brussles airport, there were the amazing summit volunteers waiting to greet mozillians and make sure we reach the right hotel. I checked into the hotel, went to the square to grab dinner/snacks and the awesome goodie bag. Next stop was the Delirium Cafe (also known for having the guiness world record for the most variety of beer in 2004) where i met a lot of awesome mozillians.\n\nOver the next couple(+1) of days i attended sessions related to privacy on the web (where we discussed about ghostery and collusion- now knows as Lightbeam), using the developer tools to debug other XUL based applications (especially thunderbird), Mozilla Reps program, MDN, OpenBadges, having a million mozillians. One thing that i liked about each session is that it was a two way session and it included more discussions and less of one way communication.\n\nOther than the sessions, I think the world fair and the innovation fair were the two awesome places to be in the summit as it gave one an opportunity to see how spread we are as mozillians and how awesome we are too.\n\nWell, you attended an event - AWESOME, but what you take away from the event decides how successful it was and how it would help you in the coming days. Here\u2019s what i got to takeaway.\n - Getting to know some of the faces behing the IRC nicks, turns out i couldnt\u2019 meet all the faces\n - Meeting the mozillians from Europe. I would like to give a special shout out to Axel Grude (the awesome AMO guru), Raivis (The Latvian mozillian, localizer, webdev, awesome!), Rimas (localizer, techie from Lithuania) and Sjmur (Mozilla ireland community manager).\n - A week after the summit and i had already helped Axel test(and find a bug too) one of his\n\nand made it to his contributor list.\n - Last but not the least, leaving with the motivation to do more and the feeling that your work is making a difference.\n\nAnother mail, another set of flights and here I am in London, Running to the Mozilla office directly from the airport to attend a reps meeting session regarding the Mozilla Festival. Oh, did i say that this was the biggest MozFest till date. This was quite a different event from other Mozilla events, because of the new set of audience and the new set of motivation. The Mozilla Festival is all about building and hacking, as they say (F*ck it, Ship it).\n\nThe first day of the event officially started with the science fair at the evening, leaving us (as facilitators) a whole day to get an idea of the flow of the event and our role in it. Me and Prashish were part a of the scrum led by Kat and Laura, where we had a wall full of problems and an army of awesome-scurm-leads (More on the scrum later). Then we had the hack-your-tshirt session where we hacked our tshirts with spray paint and sketch-pens. The event had a mega version of it with paints and what not (more on that later). Then, kicked off the real deal of the day, the Science festival. There were some awesome projects, experiments and products being displayed but i would like to give a special mention to goolabs (for their awesome work with 3d on the web), Erase all kittens(for how awesome+weird+different their approach to teaching and gaming is) and the tactile web demo from the Mozilla Japan team (believe me they were awesome)\n\nThe Day 2 kicked off with the keynotes and then moving to the track they belonged to. I first went to the #teachTheWeb track, as we were part of that track. There was a beautiful wall of\n\nwaiting to be in the making and be made eventually :D . Then i went to the openbadges section to hack on some custom badges and badges of the future. While browsing other badges i was way inspired by the\n\n. Then came the most important and happening event of the day, the Maker-Party. I am so glad that i didnt miss it, because the aurora and the spirit at the maker party was amazing (more than that). People working on stop-motion-videos, children learning to code, people making games using scratch, making (the so sweet)kumi dolls, and a lot more (there were so many things happening that i might have forgot some). That was most of the first day which ended with some awesome conversations with Henrik, Jan, Prashishh, Michael and Leo over the course of Japanese food.\n\nThe third day was mostly similar with attending more awesome sessions, meeting more awesome people, painting some more t-shirts :P and learning more intriguing ways to teach and engage people.\n\nI think the biggest takeaway from this event was how important learning is and how big a role the teacher/teaching method plays in the process. I personally learned a variety of different ways people were using to teach webmaking and moreover dozens of ways people were using the web to make things. Again, a big shout out to all the Mozilla Reps (you all are awesome), It was a great pleasure meeting each one of you.\n\nWell, I wanted to especially thank the Mozilla Nepal community (especially Avash for taking the lead initially), and the people behind the first Mozilla South Asian Meetup, where i got to meet all the community leaders (especially Deb, who is my mentor too) who eventually guided me and helped me to contribute."}

Its raining cats and dogs. Actually, It\u2019s been raining non stop for the last 2 nights. The streets are flooded and the very little traffic that is out this stormy morning is being re-routed in multiple places. I am wondering how today will go.\n\n-\nSeveral of the organizing team reach the venue. We are setting up the venue, but there is a cloud of uncertainity. The rain is not something that we had factored in our planning.\n\n-\nI get a message \u201cAvinash, I believe you should consider cancelling today.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a thought that has already cross our minds. There\u2019s news of flood in several locations of Kathmandu. Several landslides have been reported. But we also had a commitment to everyone who registered. Even if just five people showed up, we felt we owed it to them to keep the show running. And that\u2019s exactly what we were going to do.\n\n- The first group of attendees show up. We were not expecting people to show up on time, let alone at all. This was the first motivation we needed for the day.\n\n-  A few more trickled in, and by now we had around 40 people. Not bad, right? Enough for a party. A BarCamp Party.\n\nBy the end of the day we had:\n\nSome fun facts:\n\nAll in all, I am really happy with the event and how it turned out. We (as wwktm) haven\u2019t had organized an event since covid, so getting back on the \u201corganizing\u201d wheel took quite a lot of effort, But in the end, I think we pulled it off.\n\nFor next time, though, if there\u2019s a BarCamp again [1], we\u2019ll definitely plan earlier and budget better. The ticket prices were kept low this time, and unfortunately, we ended up with a few financial losses. But I\u2019d like to think of it as an investment in future events rather than a loss.\n\n[1] Let me know what you thought about the event. Your feedback helps us improve and motivates us to keep going.\n\nUntil then,\n\nBe nice to everyone :D"}

Nothing has changed in the once peaceful country. That peaceful country where people are fighting; They are divided, divided by caste, divided by religion, divided by color, divided by reason, divided without any reason. Fight all day long, fight for your ego, fight for the fake pride and then in the end of the day take pride in being the most peaceful country in the world, take pride in being the most peaceful people, take pride in coming from the land of Buddha. Great, at least we are the quintessential hypocrites.\n\nIt\u2019s sad to see the leaders fighting like children. Oh come on, we had fairer fights when we were kids. It\u2019s funny to see the parties organize a meeting with the other parties, and follow it with their own personal meetings; its clear they have no philosophy, no pride, no compassion, all they want is to maximize their profits. This child play has been the norm in one way; it has pulled everyone centuries behind. Centuries behind in thinking, in science, in contribution to society.\n\nThe smart world is working on nurturing the future generation. We? we have already lost them, we have failed them. Those kids should be studying in school, challenging their teachers, learning from their mentors, painting, drawing and solving that random equation. But, NO! They are everywhere but not where they should be. They are sitting in home playing, they are working in that brick factory where they legally shouldn\u2019t be, and they are lying on that corner of the street burning grass. But then, how could they go to school? The teachers are not motivated to teach the students; In most cases, they are there because that is the last job they could find, one that pays the least and our society has accepted it that way. Why? Simply because they are not a part of the vicious romantic consumerism cycle. If only they could produce something that could be exchanged with money. All they are doing is building the future, adding some fine touches to it, how can that be important? No gains at all!\n\nThe situation is saddening, and its getting worse day by day. Every day a political party is angry, the schools are closed! a wife and a husband have a fight, the schools are closed. I am sure this situation frustrates many more and I am aware that there are wiser beings that are working on fixing this, trying to be a part of the solution. Not rant like me by making a fuss of the problem. I think there is only one right way to solve this problem and its not a quick one, its one that takes its time but does the job. We have to change our culture, our society, our views. Education has to be taken seriously. We have to build better schools, develop infrastructure. Not schools that are money making machines, but schools that are shaping better humans and better futures. Invest the money a school generates into the teachers, into other schools. Build standards, standards that schools have to be built up to. The government has to play an active role in this, the political parties have to play an active role in this, we the citizens have a bigger role to play in this. Government schools have to rise, rise to standards that set benchmarks. The system has to invest into the future, the future that will build the system in return."}

It was a great hike with a nice weather accompanied with some beautiful landscapes. Perfect recipe for a good hike.\n\nLike every other hikes, this one also helped me think deeply and contemplate about a number of things. Among them, most of my energy was spent on thinking about the hike itself.\n\nMost of it was directed towards how can we use Hike for Nepal to create some positive impact, possibly in the hiking location, during the hike. How can we bring some positive change, slowly and steadily.\n\nOne of the things that I noticed, the hike was full of well educated Nepalese who were decently well off (approximately 1 out of 5 had a DSLR, everyone had a pretty good camera phone). This was a great group of people, possibly a specific group that could do a lot for the community. Another topic that bugged me considerably during the hike was all the plastic packaging that was littered over the place. It was sad, how ignorant we have been towards our environment. From Wai-Wai packets to empty bottles everywhere. The first thing that we could definitely do to fight this is by cleaning the mountains and hills during our hikes. I did my part during the hike and we did something similar in one of our hikes in the Bavarian Alps.\n\nThe question that I would like to ask is, how can we scale this idea of cleaning the mountains during our hike? How do we scale it from one person to the whole group. The biggest benefit of this would be that hikers would learn to clean the mountains and take back their own garbage with them. Thus, ensuring the mountains to be clean, the nature to be serene and experiences to be breathtaking.\n\nFinally, I would like to remind one of the rules from the Golden Rules for Living\n\nIf you open it, close it.\nIf you turn it on, turn it off.\nIf you unlock it, lock it up.\nIf you break it, admit it.\nIf you can\u2019t fix it, call in someone who can.\nIf you borrow it, return it.\nIf you value it, take care of it.\n\nIf you move it, put it back.\nIf it belongs to someone else and you want to use it, get permission.\nIf you don\u2019t know how to operate it, leave it alone.\nIf it\u2019s none of your business, don\u2019t ask questions.\nIf it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it.\nIf it will brighten someone\u2019s day, say it.\nIf it will tarnish someone\u2019s reputation, keep it to yourself.\n\u2014 Found somewhere in the vast vast internet, Source unknown"}

The reason is that I couldn\u2019t attend either of the two events. People were notified a couple of days in advance about the event. I\u2019m really sorry to put this out, even though it should have been obvious, two days prior notice for a meeting/event  is too less of a time. Inviting the community atleast one week in advance should be part of the event etiquette recipe. We are failing at this.

Finally, the venue opens up, we fill our bottles, get an initial briefing about the hike, get into our Sajha bus and off we go.\n\nWe reach Lakhuri Bhanjyang and Kailash from artudio gives an amazing introduction to art. He explains how you can do art with anything and it likes in the eyes of the maker. We then divide into groups based on our tshirt color -\n\n. The whole hike we used materials from nature to build small art pieces. It was the best exercise to get to know other people from our groups.\n\nThe main motive of the hike was for the attendees, speakers and organizers to mingle more and get to network at a more deeper level. I think that\u2019s what exactly happened as I got to talk to so many people and know what they were doing, get an understanding of their point of view and have deeper conversations about tech, life, community and nature.\n\nApart from the main conference and hike, some of the speakers and attendees took the opportunity to do other activities.

{"url": "https://avinash.com.np/2015/11/22/on-forgiveness/", "origin": "https://avinash.com.np/", "title": "On Forgiveness", "content": "What do you think is the right course of action, bringing justice by punishment or forgiving the wrongdoer? Fighting the fight for ego or forgiving? These are tough discussions to have and there is enough philosophical evidence to justify either side of the argument. I have come to believe that there is no \u201cright-way\u201d or \u201cthe recipe\u201d that one can follow, one must always think about the implications, the stakeholders involved and the bigger picture and take the righteous action. Even though there is no golden rule there are set of doctrines and frameworks one can follow that is considered to be on a higher moral ground.\n\nMost of the times when we are thinking of forgiveness, the alternate course of action is radical, extreme, one that we consider not ourselves. The reason to be in such a state is generally because our pride has been touched, the ego has been hurt and betrayal has been committed.\n\n.. the same dualism underlies the nature and condition of man. Every excess causes a defect; every defect an excess. Every sweet hath its sour; every evil its good. Every faculty which is a receiver of pleasure has an equal penalty put on its abuse. It is to answer for its moderation with its life. For every grain of wit there is a grain of folly\u2026\n\nEmerson has very nicely said that the world is an equation and everything that is done will have a reaction. If that\u2019s the case then does it not make sense to follow the path of peace and let nature do its job. Why should we take part in the wrongdoing? Because we want to satisfy our ego, want our pride back. What guarantee is there that the pride is restored after the action? None. Maybe it is better to live without pride, without happiness. Being neutral in every sense. Every happiness will have its sadness.\n\nNo man had ever a point of pride that was not injurious to him.\n\nSimilar was the situation of Yudhishthir in Mahabharat when he was persuaded by his wife and brothers to go to war and fight against Duryodhan. This was during their time in exile. His response was that its harder to give forgiveness, it takes more energy to forgive.\n\nForgiveness is the strength of the virtuous. To fight is easy, but to forgive is difficult. To be patient is not to be weak; to seek peace is always the wiser course.\n\nThe epic has it that they went to war, the great battle of kurukshetra took place and after numerous tricks and deceits of Krishna (the charioteer and God) they win the war, they get their kingdom back. At this point of time Yudhishthir doesn\u2019t have pride in winning the war, is not content to have his kingdom back. On the contrary, he is sad, in remorse, in pain, thinking about all the deaths of his teacher, his brothers, his men.\n\nTo get a piece of the earth we totally abandoned men who were equal to the earth, men whom we should never have killed. And now we live with our kinsmen dead and our wealth exhausted\u2026 like dogs we greedily went after a piece of meat! Now our piece of meat is gone, and so are those who would have eaten it. The heroes are dead. The evil is done. Our kindgom has been laid waste. Having killed them, our rage is gone. Now this grief holds me in check!\nExcerpts from Mahabharat -\n\n(The difficulty of being Good)\n\nOne might argue if the path of forgiveness is always the higher moral ground, wouldn\u2019t the world be unfair. What would have happened to slavery in America? what would happen to Indians under the British Raaj ? What would have happened to Jews during WWII ? These are all valid questions and it does seem like forgiveness has a conflict with Justice in a larger sense.\n\nOne way to look at it is by weighing the deeds. Some deeds have so much evil, there is so much bad into it that it is beyond forgiveness or the psychological burden of forgiveness is too high to be granted. This does mean that its not our strength at display but our weakness at display in this case. In Mahabharat, Yudhishthir before going to war, justifies it as his duty and an act he must do even though he doesn\u2019t like it. Maybe the idea is to look at the bigger good and act accordingly. These are nevertheless really tough decisions to make and maybe your duty is what can justify the course of action. Maybe that is how Jack Dorsey would also justify\n\n.\n\nThese are very tough topics to think about and to come to a worthy conclusion. All I can say and suggest is to think of the possibilities, weight all the options, see the impact and then eventually\n\n. One fun learning I\u2019ve had is that, it is much easier to write on this topic than to have a contextual discussion."}

I got a letter which asked to be present at the customs office in 3 days.\n\nI went to the customs office. Had a talk with a super helpful lady, who helped me get my shipment. She then asked me to open the package, did an inspection of what was shipped. Finally, she told me the import duty  which I had to pay for the shipment. In less than 15 minutes I was out of the office and my job was done.\n\nOne month ago someone again shipped me a piece of gadget. This time it was sent to Kathmandu, Nepal. FedEx told me that my shipment was at the airport customs and I had to get hold of an agent at the customs to get my shipment. They delivered me the documents which I could use to extract the shipment.\n\nAll good and fine. I talked to an agent and handed him my documents, which were to be used to extract the shipment from the customs. I hoped it to be a quick and painless process. Unfortunately, the introduction of an agent to the process keeps us in the dark; Now, I have no idea what\u2019s going on in customs land.\n\nEach of my discussion with the customs agent was basically that the shipment couldn\u2019t be extracted and they\u2019ll try again tomorrow. After ~20 days I pushed the agent a little and tried to get more details. According to them, someone had shipped gold via FedEx which is why customs were not letting any FedEx document be extracted.\n\nI went to the customs office, and It was chaotic. It took me hours to find the right person to talk to. Basically, just to hear the same gold story again.\n\nIn the mean time, I mentioned this to FedEx as well, the only support they could give me was \u201cI\u2019ll talk to my superior and see how we can help you here\u201d\n\nFast forward today, I still don\u2019t have my shipment. Nepal Government still doesn\u2019t have the customs duty they deserve. Lose-Lose situation. Unless, my shipment has been hijacked and a customs official has gifted it to his son. Then, someone does win here. Believe me, I have heard stories of that happening.\n\nThis process is seriously messed up and is the story of pretty much every government office in Nepal. The processes in offices are so chaotic, super ad-hoc and enough touch points to exploit a person. Which is also the reason why going to a government office is a dreadful experience every time.\n\nOur systems are messed up, our processes are messed up and the sad part is that there is no one doing anything about it. The only place one can complain or state grievances is to a twitter handle (or bot) of HelloSarkar. It definitely gives one a feeling of being heard, but nothing happens in the end.\n\nThis one time, all I have is a rant. No solutions, No actions that can be taken to make things better. If there is something that we can do, please enlighten me. I\u2019m all ears.\n\nUpdate : I did get my shipment eventually"}

The world got divided, the poor countries make and the rich countries consume. There is an incentive to have cheap labor in the world.

Shouldn\u2019t it be the other way round, that all products are \u201cfair-trade\u201d by default and the products that have had unfair procedures would be labeled as \u201cunfair-trade\u201d.

Contrary to the fact that a lot would suggest to do it at a startup, I wanted to do it at a big company because I have never worked at one and wanted to learn from that experience. It must be magic to manage so many people, so many developers and still spit out the best of the products.\n\nI applied to number of companies but I would like to comment on my experience with facebook, microsoft and mozilla. Facebook was kind of sad because I had an interview where I was asked some basic questions about JavaScript and we talked about how some things were implemented in facebook. Post the interview, they didnt reply for about a month and when I contacted the recruiter, got a reply that I couldn\u2019t be offered a postition. Sad :\u2018(\n\nNext was Microsoft. This one was really surprising because the interviewer asked me some really random question and two puzzles and eventually replied with a negative. Maybe I was supposed to not solve the puzzles.\n\nWhen all this action was happening, I had also applied for an internship at mozilla. This was one that I had some expectations from, mostly because I had been a contributor to mozilla for some time and luckily there was an open internship position for a project that I had already been contributing to. I applied and Kaboom, \u201cwe did not find a fit this time\u201d. This was very disheartening, but I eventually talked to one of the project devs about it and he told that he\u2019d look into it. About a week later, I got an email from a recruiter saying they\u2019d like to interview me for the internship. Yay!\n\nWell, that did sound awesome, I hopped into the opportunity and did some reading, sharpening that blade. I had 3 really interesting interviews and after quite a long wait I got an email which basically said that they\u2019d like to move with another candidate mostly because he had more experience and I still had a year of university to learn from(o_O).\n\nSo, basically after this I was quite sad and felt really bad. I for one thought a lot about this and there were the times when I thought maybe I was not good at all. This brought me to think about some of my open source contributions as well. I used to contribute to open source mostly because I was learning a lot and learned a lot about good code, code review, processes and approach to some serious problems. But, with of all of this it also felt like why was I even contributing to a project where I was not even worth it. Sadly, I do feel that at times, but I like it when I learn.\n\nI know recruiting is a tough work and there are some tough and quick decisions to make because of which a lot of factors come into play like where one comes from, where one is currently located, one\u2019s name and lots of other tiny details. I dont say its intentional but everyone is judgemental when you have to make a decision. That is why I know lots of amazing people back in India and Nepal who have been rejected who I think are among the A grade talent and lots of people would agree to me. Maybe there\u2019s a problem, one that seriously needs to be solved. But yes, this doesn\u2019t change the fact that I may be useless as well (lets hope I\u2019m not).\n\nWell, I have been conspirating on some secret schemes with a bunch of amazing people and I must say, I am enjoying it. Regarding contributing to mozilla, I would be (as a developer)inactive for a while, for sure, maybe a lot more. But I am still the guy who contributes to the open web and loves to see the web crossing it boundaries."}

This line has been so smartly crafted, I feel awe everytime I read it.\n\nGandalf! If you had heard only a quarter of what I have heard about him, and I have only heard very little of all there is to hear, you would be prepared for any sort I of remarkable tale.\n\nIn the first\n\n, there is a scene where Gandalf explains why there is a Hobbit with the Dwarves. This line has a lot of signifiance in terms of understanding what\u2019s important in life, the power of mundane daily tasks.\n\nMithrandir, why the Halfling?\n\nI do not know. Saruman believes that it is only great power that can hold evil in check. But that it is not what I\u2019ve found. I\u2019ve found it is the small things, every act of normal folk that keeps the darkness of at bay \u2014 simple acts of kindness and love. Why Bilbo Baggins? Perhaps it is because I am afraid, and he gives me courage.\n\nAnd, before I close this, another well crafted line from JRR Tolkien; this one is not from the hobbit, but from \u201cThe fellowship of the ring\u201d. I\u2019ve read it number of times and every time its confusing, but does tickle the brain.\n\nI don\u2019t know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve.\n\nFin."}

My method of reading the book has been rather unmethodical. Every couple of days/weeks when I feel like it, I pick up the book and continue reading where i last left off. Sometimes when I come across a strong thought (which happens more often than not in this book), I keep that thought in my mind and try to put it into action over time.\n\nThe following excerpt from the book has had a huge impact on me. I think about it very often and it reminds me of other quotes and sayings that I keep close to myself (and have collected mentally over the years)\n\nLiving life as an artist is a practice.\nYou are either engaging in the practice or you\u2019re not.\n\nIt makes no sense to say you\u2019re not good at it\nIt\u2019s like saying, \u201cI\u2019m not good at beting a monk.\u201d\nYou are either living as a monk or you\u2019re not.\n\nWe tend to think of the artist\u2019s work as the output.\n\nThe real work of the artist is a way of being in the world.\n\nThere is another quote from the Psychologist Alfred Adler that I heard back in 2015 and It has impacted the way I act on this very much. The quote goes as follows\n\n\u201cIt is easier to fight for ones principles than to live up to them.\u201d.\n\nSuch a strong statement. We all have principles, and there are principles that we very often are very strict about in \u201cwords\u201d and stricter when we see other people going against it. But, when it comes to us living by those principles, we very easily defy them and create loopholes for our own convenience. The way this has impacted my is as follows \u2013 In most cases before acting and saying things to people, I think if they are pragmatic or rather principle based. If they are principle based, I tend to not speak them as often as I would in past. These are my principles and as long as someone else is not crossing boundaries, I would allow them to live by theirs and I\u2019d \u201ctry\u201d to live by mine. I don\u2019t want to spend my time \u201cfighting\u201d for my principles. Atleast, I am not here to spread it, I think.\n\nThere is one more quote along similar lines as Rick Rubin. It\u2019s from \u201cThe Tibetian book of living and dying\u201d by Sogyal Rinpoche. I unfortunately don\u2019t recall the exact words from the book, and don\u2019t have a copy to get it from. But, the feeling of the words remain with me \u2013\n\nYou cannot meditate for some time and then be not meditating. That is not how meditation works. Meditation is a way of life.\n\nSpeaking for myself, I tend to think a lot about my principles and topics that I am interested in. And based on that, I try to live my life focusing on those topics, learning about them, acting as I belong to learn about those topics and create something with them. Its not important if the creation changes the world. Its not important if the creation is well known in the world. The only thing that is important is that it changes me. And, it changes me for good. I hope."}

I would like it if everyone reads it again and make it their motto for 2018.\n\n\u2013\n\nIf you have been drowned in the overwhelming series of posts about new year\u2019s resolution and have come to a point that you have to make one,\n\nThe best new years resolution that you can make is to become a maker. We are surrounded by news, articles, blogs, videos, books and the source of information and knowledge is never-ending. But, in between all of this, what we have really forgotten is to think, think about stuff and develop a perception about things. This new year, make a resolution that you will be a thinker, a tinkerer.\n\nwill not be a mere consumer of knowledge, but, you\u2019ll make a contribution to the pool of knowledge. It is much better to read one article and think about it; Instead of reading numerous articles and just filling your database of knowledge.\n\nThe maker mentioned here is not the type of maker that hipsters are talking about now-a-days\n\n(* were talking of back then *)\n\n\u2013\n\nOn one hand, I will (have started already) invest more time in documenting things I learn (for myself and others). On the other hand, I have to start policing myself on reading every other article/book/comment. Let\u2019s see how that will go, only time will tell.\n\nRemember, It is important to\n\nwhat you want to do, the first step to make things real.\n\nIn some cases, same same, but different :D\n\nA post shared by\n\n(@pumbaaguy) on\n\n\u2013\n\n** Do it!! even if it sucks.

This was a two day event completely focused on developing web applications which would also work on Firefox OS.\n\n###Day 1\nThe first day of the event was aimed at giving the audience an idea of mozilla, the mozilla community and Firefox OS, ofcourse. Vineel started by talking about mozilla and the community, Sayak continued by introducing the idea of Firefox OS and why it was required, Soumya then took on the stage and discussed some technical details about the platform and eventually Robin, Sayak, Biraj and me gave some demos on firefox OS application and the process of writing a basic \u201chello world\u201d application. The talks went pretty well but one thing that struck me was the audience. This was a very different audience, compared to other events because they were paying attention, asking questions, interacting and were actually making sense. Believe me, this rarely happens in an engineering college in India :D.\n\n###Day 2\nThe second day was roughly divided into two parts, the hackaton and the presentations. The hackathon went pretty well and most of the attendees got a taste of, how easy it was to make an application for firefox OS using open web technologies. It was amazing to see about 30 applications being presented at the end of the day. I guess, we can say it was a win!\n\nThat was all about the event. I would like to thank the FORMAT Team, especially Avik, Gaurab and Subhashish for the warm reception and managing the event in such a professional manner.

In some cases I have also added the reasoning or the idea that is being sent across by the text or just notest that made sense to accompany them. I am still reading the whole essay and will at one point write my thoughts and views on it (maybe).\n\nThe essay mostly talks about why its important to know thyself; why knowing yourself and accepting your thoughts might be tough. The following part of the text talks about the times when one was not courageous enough to speak their heart or do what they heeded to do, and later realized that someone else said/did it and got all the glory (though some parts of the text also deals with why getting the glory, or working to get the glory is not important at all)\n\nA man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes across his mind from within, more than the lustre of the firmament of bards and sages. Yet he dismisses without notice his thought, because it is his. In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts: they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.\n\n.. Else, to-morrow a stranger will say with masterly good sense precisely what we have thought and felt all the time, and we shall be forced to take with shame our own opinion from another.\n\nThis part of the essay deals with one having to do something that they don\u2019t like, but are doing it just because it made sense at one point of time and they don\u2019t want to contradict themselves. It somehow goes into the lines of\n\nwhere one has the mental stress or discomfort because of contradictory beliefs in their mind and are motivated to reduce this dissonance (Based on the definition from wikipedia)\n\nThe other terror that scares us from self-trust is our consistency; a reverence for our past act or word, because the eyes of others have no other data for computing our orbit than our past acts, and we are loath to disappoint them.\n\nBut why should you keep your head over your shoulder? Why drag about this corpse of your memory, lest you contradict somewhat you have stated in this or that public place? Suppose you should contradict yourself; what then? It seems to be a rule of wisdom never to rely on your memory alone, scarcely even in acts of pure memory, but to bring the past for judgment into the thousand-eyed present, and live ever in a new day. In your metaphysics you have denied personality to the Deity: yet when the devout motions of the soul come, yield to them heart and life, though they should clothe God with shape and color. Leave your theory, as Joseph his coat in the hand of the harlot, and flee.\n\nWith consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words, and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said to-day. \u2014 \u2018Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood.\u2019 \u2014 Is it so bad, then, to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh.\n\nThe following paragraph tries to talk about the moment, and how one should live in the present and not sulk in the past or worry about the future. It is somehow way more philosophical compared to the rest of the text till this part. Similar ideas have been mentioned in Buddhist texts that talk about mindfulness and being available for the moment rathar than being in a different point of time.\n\nMan is timid and apologetic; he is no longer upright; he dares not say \u2018I think,\u2019 \u2018I am,\u2019 but quotes some saint or sage. He is ashamed before the blade of grass or the blowing rose. These roses under my window make no reference to former roses or to better ones; they are for what they are; they exist with God to-day. There is no time to them. There is simply the rose; it is perfect in every moment of its existence. Before a leaf-bud has burst, its whole life acts; in the full-blown flower there is no more; in the leafless root there is no less. Its nature is satisfied, and it satisfies nature, in all moments alike. But man postpones or remembers; he does not live in the present, but with reverted eye laments the past, or, heedless of the riches that surround him, stands on tiptoe to foresee the future. He cannot be happy and strong until he too lives with nature in the present, above time.\n\nOn failure, and pressures from the society and believing in yourself.\n\nIf our young men miscarry in their first enterprises, they lose all heart. If the young merchant fails, men say he is ruined. If the finest genius studies at one of our colleges, and is not installed in an office within one year afterwards in the cities or suburbs of Boston or New York, it seems to his friends and to himself that he is right in being disheartened, and in complaining the rest of his life. A sturdy lad from New Hampshire or Vermont, who in turn tries all the professions, who teams it, farms it, peddles, keeps a school, preaches, edits a newspaper, goes to Congress, buys a township, and so forth, in successive years, and always, like a cat, falls on his feet, is worth a hundred of these city dolls. He walks abreast with his days, and feels no shame in not \u2018studying a profession,\u2019 for he does not postpone his life, but lives already. He has not one chance, but a hundred chances. Let a Stoic open the resources of man, and tell men they are not leaning willows, but can and must detach themselves; that with the exercise of self-trust, new powers shall appear; that a man is the word made flesh, born to shed healing to the nations, that he should be ashamed of our compassion, and that the moment he acts from himself, tossing the laws, the books, idolatries, and customs out of the window, we pity him no more, but thank and revere him, and that teacher shall restore the life of man to splendor, and make his name dear to all history.\n\nTo the end of the essay, the author talks about the\n\n. To begin with, I had a totally different view on travelling, like the \u201chow it changes you\u201d and \u201cyou discover yourself\u201d view that the world has, but since the last\n\n\u2044\n\nmonths, I have come to realise that travelling is just a concept that has come from romantic consumerism. Author\n\nbriefly talks about it in his book\n\nas well. Nevertheless, this is a different view on the same thing and was quite interesting to read, since it is dated from the 19th century.\n\nTravelling is a fool\u2019s paradise. Our first journeys discover to us the indifference of places. At home I dream that at Naples, at Rome, I can be intoxicated with beauty, and lose my sadness. I pack my trunk, embrace my friends, embark on the sea, and at last wake up in Naples, and there beside me is the stern fact, the sad self, unrelenting, identical, that I fled from. I seek the Vatican, and the palaces. I affect to be intoxicated with sights and suggestions, but I am not intoxicated. My giant goes with me wherever I go.\n\nTo wrap things up,\nA quote from the book Khushi by Vijay Kumar (\u0916\u0941\u0938\u0940 - \u0935\u093f\u091c\u092f \u0915\u0941\u092e\u093e\u0930 ) is very apt to this topic:\n\n\u0905\u093e\u092b\u0942\u0932\u093e\u0908 \u0905\u093e\u092b\u0948\u0901 \u092a\u0930\u093f\u092d\u093e\u0937\u093f\u0924 \u0917\u0930\u093f\u0928\u0901 \u092d\u0928\u0947 \u0905\u0930\u0941\u0932\u0947 \u092e\u0932\u093e\u0908 \u0924\u093f\u0928\u0915\u0948 \u0938\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0926\u0905\u0928\u0941\u0938\u093e\u0930 \u092a\u0930\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0930 \u092c\u0928\u093e\u090f\u0930 \u0916\u093e\u0928\u0947\u091b\u0928\u094d \u0964\n\u2013 \u0932\u094b\u0930\u094d\u0921\u0947\n> If I don\u2019t define myself others will make a dish of me based on their taste and eat.\n\nPS: still reading and will be adding stuff"}
{"url": "https://chsmc.org/2024/03/inaka-summer/", "origin": "https://chasem.co/thoughts/", "title": "Boku no Natsuyasumi | Chase McCoy", "content": "Several months ago, in\n\n, I\u00a0discovered\n\nby Tim Rogers (known as Action Button).\n\nTo call this a review is surely stretching the limits of the word\u2019s meaning as we know it.\n\nBoku no Natsuyasumi, henceforth shortened as Bokunatsu, is a game for the original PlayStation released 24 years ago in Japan. And only in Japan. It centers on a young boy, Boku, spending a month of his summer vacation with his aunt, uncle, and their family in the countryside of Japan in August of 1975.\n\nPlayers can explore the countryside as Boku, collect bugs, fish, fly kites, and other low-stakes activities you might expect from a child on summer break.\n\nSlowly, you learn about the people around you and their stories.\n\nSounds simple, but watch Tim\u2019s review and you\u2019ll see that the game is a subtle masterclass in storytelling, menu design, cinematography, typography, skeuomorphism, Japanese culture, sound design, memory, and even mortality.\n\nI became determined to experience the game myself, which is easier said than done given that it was never released outside of Japan. I managed to find\n\n, translated by a fan, for the game\u2019s sequel Boku no Natsuyasumi 2: Umi no Bouken-hen (My Summer Vacation 2: Sea Adventure Chapter). The sequel, released two years after the original, also follows a boy named Boku vacationing in the countryside in August of 1975.\n\nArmed with the patch file, I needed 3 more items to complete my quest: a PS2 emulator, a PS2 BIOS (the software pre-installed on the console\u2019s chipset), and a copy of Boku no Natsuyasumi 2.\n\nLuckily, the emulator is easy to come by. I downloaded\n\n, which is an open source PS2 emulator that works quite well on my MacBook Air.\n\nUnfortunately, for Legal Reasons\u2122 I cannot provide a link to the PS2 BIOS or the the game itself, but a cursory Google search should turn up the files you need without too much trouble.\n\nWith these 4 talismans in hand I was able to perform the necessary ritual of resurrection: apply the English patch to the game, boot up the PS2 emulator, load the game.\n\nAfter a few clicks\u2026 paydirt.\n\nAn experienced gamer might find this process mundane, but to me it feels like the internet equivalent of breaking open an ancient, hidden tomb. At this point I could only imagine what treasures may lie within.\n\nWhat I discovered is undoubtedly a work of art, made clear by my time playing this iteration and from Tim\u2019s review of the original. The games also happen to be an example of the billions of bytes of lost media that are just waiting to be rediscovered by someone who will appreciate them.\n\nHere is a game, published 22 years ago, that has managed to evoke feelings of nostalgia and wistfulness in me today, in 2024. This must be the closest thing to time travel I\u2019ll ever experience.\n\nI knew lots about the game before playing due to Tim\u2019s review (which, again, is a 6 hour masterpiece), but there are two aspects I couldn\u2019t fully appreciate until playing: the game\u2019s backgrounds and soundscapes.\n\nFirst, the backgrounds. Bokunatsu makes use of a fixed perspective, where the camera only changes angles when the character moves to another scene. Each area that the user can move through is set upon a\n\nhand-painted background. If you\u2019ve ever seen a Miyazaki film you have a sense for the feelings that these backdrops create. A 3D modeled scene would never have evoked such a strong sense of place, time, and character, and the creative decision to use hand drawn backgrounds makes all the difference.\n\nThere\u2019s a narrative purpose to the backgrounds as well, signaling the time of day as they change throughout between different paintings for day, afternoon, and night.\n\nThe backgrounds were done by artists at an animation studio called Kusanagi.\n\n, but I heartily encourage you to browse through all of the art on their site.\n\nKazuo Oga is a famous background painter and the person responsible for many of the backgrounds in your favorite Miyazaki films.\n\n:\n\nThat\u2019s really the heart of it. Oga notices things \u2014 little things. He gets a feel for them. When he sits down to work, he brings with him all the unimportant details that matter the most. Then, with his paint, he creates an artwork that centers those details, elevates them. It\u2019s more a way of seeing and feeling than it is a technique.\n\nAll the unimportant details that matter the most\u2014paying attention to these details are precisely what make Bokunatsu, from its backgrounds to the narrative itself, so plainly striking.\n\nThe backgrounds are complimented by the soundscapes. These are, in my opinion, the best part of the game.\n\nOf all the characteristics of summer, it may be the sounds which I most associate with the season. I grew up in the rural south, and Bokunatsu manages to capture the droning sounds of summer in a way I\u2019ve never experienced before in media.\n\nAt times, I\u2019ve let the game run in the background just to listen to the soundscapes.\n\n, Sony sent a team into the mountains to capture sounds for the game.\n\nDear reader, I\u2019m here to tell you that the effort paid off.\n\nThe game\u2019s environment is alive with the sounds of insects chirping, the wind blowing through a nearby chime, the trickling of a nearby stream. As Boku explores the countryside time advances and, like the background art, the sounds change to evoke the feeling of morning, afternoon, and night.\n\nAnimal Crossing, which debuted the year after the original Boku no Natsuyasumi game, is held up as the shining example of cozy, relaxing video games. I am a true fan of the Animal Crossing franchise, but with its gameplay literally focused on grinding in order to pay your landlord they stand in stark comparison to a game like Bokunatsu. Animal Crossing rewards completionism, and in doing so makes the game about grinding instead of actually relaxing.\n\nIn comparison, the only thing you\u2019ll get for collecting all of the bugs or catching all of the fish in Boku is a diary entry written by the boy at night before bed. And, like in real life, maybe that\u2019s enough?\n\nDiscovering and playing Bokunatsu (and watching Tim\u2019s 6 hour magnum opus of a review) has given me a deep appreciation for the timelessness of art and media.\n\nA game from 24 years ago, deeply steeped in a culture that isn\u2019t my own, has managed to create in me a sense of warm nostalgia. Its soundscapes remind me of home, but also make me long for a place I\u2019ve never been.\n\nIt\u2019s\u00a0also worth appreciating the meta aspect of the journey I went on to discover and experience this game, all because of a link in a newsletter. This is why the web is so special, and it\u2019s what an AI will never do: unearth a lost gem.\n\nWhen writing in his diary at the end of each in-game day, Boku reflects on \u201cthe most wonderful day in which nothing happened.\u201d Let this be a reminder that there is magic waiting to be found in the mundane."}
{"url": "http://colah.github.io/posts/2020-05-University/", "origin": "http://colah.github.io/", "title": "Do I Need to Go to University? -- colah's blog", "content": "Posted on May 30th, 2020\n\nI\u2019ve been somewhat successful as a researcher without an undergraduate degree or PhD.\n    As a result, I often have people ask me about whether it\u2019s possible to be successful without going to university,\n    whether they personally should, or whether I can help them persuade their parents.\n    At this point, I've probably received around a hundred emails on this topic.\n    It's still hard to know how to respond.\n\nI\u2019m reluctant to encourage people I don\u2019t know well to take non-traditional paths,\n    because I think they\u2019re riskier and depend a lot on the person.\n    In fact, I suspect that many of the people who write to me would be well served by going to university.\n    At the same time, I think alternative paths can be a great choice for some people\n    -- in some cases, significantly better than going to university.\n\nUnfortunately, society isn\u2019t very well set up to support and validate young people for whom this is the better choice.\n    So, if you\u2019re considering doing such a thing, you not only need to reason about whether it\u2019s a good decision, but may also need to navigate tricky emotional and social challenges.\n\nI suspect that some people who write to me are really looking for validation and support of their preference to not go to university.\n    Unfortunately, I\u2019m not well positioned to give that support, because I don\u2019t know them well.\n\nWhat I can give, and what this essay aims to do,\n    is to share thoughts on ways to think about the decision,\n    navigating the social and emotional challenges,\n    and resources you may find helpful.\n\nMy first suggestion is to compare university to concrete alternatives.\n    Instead of asking \u201cIs university good?\u201d, ask \u201cDo I have something more compelling to do?\u201d.\n    Instead of \u201cShould I do a PhD?\u201d, ask \u201cWhere can I find the best environment to grow as a researcher?\u201d.\n    And so forth.\n\nSpending a year doing something else is almost always reversible:\n    if you end up wanting to go back to university, it was just a gap year.\n    As a result, the most important question is whether it will be time well spent\n    and that requires you to think about what specifically you\u2019ll be doing.\n\nIf your plan is to learn or work on projects independently, it\u2019s worth thinking especially carefully.\n    This can be great -- I did it for three years and grew a lot as a result -- but it can also very easily fail.\n    Some important questions to ask yourself are:\n\nSome of these questions are tempting to just say yes to without engaging:\n    \u201c\n\nI can work self-directed without structure.\u201d\n    But these are actually difficult things, and switching to having no structure is jumping into the deep end.\n    Many of the people I\u2019ve seen successfully work independently in their late teens / early twenties had a history of independent study or projects before doing so.\n    For example, many Thiel Fellows had either self studied to the point where they were they largely knew the undergraduate curriculum in some topic, or had significant applied expertise in programming.\n\nDoing an internship, residency, or startup can be easier\n    -- at least in some regards -- than working independently.\n    There\u2019s more structure (especially in the first two) and a clearer path to supporting yourself.\n    For these, I would mostly focus on how valuable you think the experience will be.\n    Do you feel like you\u2019ll learn? Does it feel like a good community? Does it feel important?\n    If it feels urgent, is the urgency for good reasons?\n\nIt\u2019s important to be aware that not having a degree can have several negative long-term consequences.\n\nUniversity degrees have a lot of signaling and credentialing value.\n    They cheaply communicate to other individuals and organizations that you have some baseline skills, at least in theory.\n    In some fields, you can succeed without a degree by demonstrating skill in other ways (publications, open source projects, portfolios, talks, awards, work history, referrals, etc).\n    Other fields are less accepting.\n    How can you tell which type of field you're in?\n    One useful test can be to look for examples of people who are successful without degrees in your field.\n    Even if your field is very good about this, you may wish to move into another field at some later point and run into challenges where your previous successes aren\u2019t legible to the new field, or the new field is more credential focused.\n\nUnfortunately, traditional credentials may be more important for demographics than others.\n    As a white male, I suspect that it's easier for me to be taken seriously without a degree that it would be for others.\n    If you are part of a group that society is less likely to perceive as skilled by default, it may be harder to do without the validation of a degree.\n    This is obviously really unfair, but I don't feel qualified to give advice on it or comment on how big an issue it is.\n\nThere's also a weird flip side to all these downsides.\n    Once you establish yourself as competent there is this kind of threshold effect where not having a university degree can suddenly start causing people to actually take you more seriously.\n    This kind of countersignalling effect seems to be common when you do non-traditional things.\n\nIn addition to the direct career consequences, not having a degree can be a source of major immigration challenges.\n    The version of this I\u2019ve seen most often is people wanting to move to the US (usually the Bay Area) but being ineligible for most visas due to the lack of a degree.\n    If you think you may have this problem, try to do a short consultation with an immigration lawyer early: there may be things you can do to start building a case.\n    (For those immigrating to the US, the solution to this is usually to get an \u201calien of extraordinary ability\u201d O-1 visa, which doesn\u2019t require a degree but does require a lot of evidence of your accomplishments.)\n\nUnfortunately, even if you feel confident that you would be best served by taking a non-traditional path, many young people face significant social and emotional barriers to doing so, particularly from adults.\n    While some people are lucky enough to have a family that will support them doing something unusual, many are not.\n    This can manifest in ways ranging from gentle skepticism, to lack of support, all the way up to coercive measures.\n    It can also involve hurtful accusations or gossiping (eg. someone isn\u2019t going to university because they\u2019re lazy or failed).\n\nSkepticism or lack of support from family often comes from a good place.\n    People around you are, naturally, worried about what will happen to you if you do something unusual.\n    They may also face other pressures.\n    For example, they may worry that their peers will think they are being irresponsible by \u201callowing\u201d their child to do this.\n    They may even worry how it will influence legal proceedings like a divorce, if such a thing is relevant.\n    It can feel especially hurtful when these other pressures are clearly major factors.\n    It\u2019s a difficult and emotionally stressful situation on both sides.\n\nThe situation is often complicated by deeply asymmetric power dynamics.\n    Depending on the situation, your parents may have direct legal power, you may depend on them for financial support, you may depend on them for housing, and even if you are self-sufficient they may have legal control of your assets.\n    They also have, independent of their hard power, a great deal of emotional power from the role and authority they\u2019ve exercised throughout your life.\n    This can make the situation scary, volatile, and in some cases potentially dangerous for you.\n\nThe most common resolution I\u2019ve seen or heard of is external validation:\n    someone gets a Thiel Fellowship, or their startup gets funded, etc, and people around them become much more supportive.\n    This can be a somewhat disappointing resolution for the \u201cvalidated\u201d party (\u201cwhy couldn\u2019t they believe in me before I was endorsed?\u201d).\n    It may help to try and picture things from the perspective of someone who is scared for you and doesn\u2019t understand the situation very well.\n\nIn many cases, communicating with your family may be helpful.\n    There\u2019s a lot of general advice on how to have difficult conversations (non-violent communication, difficult conversations, etc.) that might be useful in having an effective conversation.\n    There's also more specific advice on how to have particular kinds of difficult conversations with your parents (eg. telling them that you're gay, or an atheist, or other things they may not respond to well) that may have some transferable advice.\n    Unfortunately, there are also cases where communicating might make things worse, because of the asymmetric power adults may have over you.\n\nWhile it won\u2019t solve the fundamental issues, it can be extremely emotionally helpful to have an aligned support network.\n    Having people who were proud of me for good reasons and could recognize my successes and failures was deeply affirming and motivating for me.\n    This is something you can deliberately build by seeking out people who share your interests and values.\n\n(In truly extreme cases, such as abusive families,\n    there may be ways to get support from a family court, get yourself emancipated or have your custody transferred.\n    There may be softer courses of action, like living with family or friends for a bit without legal action.\n    These are extreme courses of action that may sometimes be the best of many terrible options in rare cases.\n    I've also heard stories where they made things worse.\n    I don't feel qualified to give advice on this; if you are considering it, please seek specialized advice and be careful.\n    You may be able to go to a legal clinic or get a pro-bono consultation with a family lawyer.\n    You may wish to confirm confidentiality rules before speaking, in case they are different for someone underage.\n    There may be specialized non-profits in your area that can give you advice, hotlines, or useful resources online.\n    I am not the right person to ask for advice on this.)\n\nFor many people, university is a period of social development.\n    They learn social skills, make long-term friends, and form romantic relationships.\n    For some people, especially readers of this essay, it seems possible this is the biggest benefit of university.\n\nIt seems like many precocious young adults who leave university have less friends their own age.\n    Does that mean that not going to university stunts social development?\n    It seems hard to tell to what extent going to university actually causally effects social outcomes rather than just being correlated with them.\n    After all, it seems like many of us also didn't connect that much with our peers in grade school.\n    For example, I was intensely bullied in elementary school, and while I had friends in high school, I wasn't that close to anyone.\n    In fact, until recently, the vast majority of my friends have been 5-10 years older than me.\n    Conversely, I have friends I'd put in the \"precocious teenager\" category who went to university but didn't seem to really make friends their own age, especially during their freshman year.\n\nMy guess is that correlated issues -- like not fitting in with one's age group and maybe being a bit shy -- are the bigger effect,\n    but that there's also a direct causal effect from not going to university.\n    Either way, I suspect some readers may find it hard to make friends among peers, regardless of their decision on university.\n    So it seems good to talk about a little bit.\n\nFirstly, I think it's okay to have your friends be older than you.\n    Teenage-Chris had lots of deeply meaningful connections with older friends and I think that was fine.\n    They were often more emotionally mature, thoughtful, and principled than my teenage peers, and sometimes felt like older siblings.\n    Over time, the age gap became less significant and by my mid 20s it was gone.\n\nI do think there's a lot to be said for investing in being social if it doesn't come naturally for you.\n    University might make being social easier, but I think committing yourself to investing it it is much more important.\n    For me, I've always disliked bars and parties, but I deeply cherish having close friends, which requires me to meet people.\n    What should I do?\n    Partly I've found it important to push to go to parties even if I find them stressful.\n    But I've found it more helpful to just really deliberately seek out social contexts that I do like,\n    and to create new ones if I can't find them.\n    For example, last year I held lots of small tea parties, and it was lovely!\n\nAnother concern is the effect of not going to university on romantic relationships.\n    Many people have their first serious relationship in university, and I've seen friends, both male and female, worry about having missed this.\n    For me, there was a point when it seemed like most of my peers had found a partner in undergrad,\n    and younger-Chris was dramatically worried that he'd lost his chance and would be alone forever.\n    In retrospect, I was more worried than I needed to be.\n    Most of those relationships didn't last and, at least in my social circles, most people find their long-term partner outside university.\n    I'm now inclined towards a middle view: going to university is helpful for finding your life partner, and missing out on that is perhaps the biggest cost of not going, but it's also only one factor.\n    It's cliche, but the thing that really does matter is putting yourself out there, meeting people you might connect with,\n    and waiting for the\n\nto add up.\n\nThere's one final subtle issue I want to mention, which intersects with all of the above:\n     not going to university can create a professional gap between you and your age group.\n    I became a full time researcher at Google Brain when I was 23.\n    In that role, I started teaching, mentoring, and even managing residents and PhD interns who were often quite a bit older than me.\n    And sometimes when I spent time with people in my age group outside of work -- often, junior PhD students at that point -- people would not infrequently ask me about opportunities to do an internship with me.\n    But the thing I wanted was to find friends and peers, not find an intern!\n    Even when people didn't do this, I worried a lot about the possibility that I was in a position of power relative to people I was interacting with.\n    Meanwhile, a lot of my professional colleagues were older than me and, having known me since I was a teenager, still treated me that way.\n    This dynamic of mismatched professional achievement faded for a variety of reasons as I moved into my mid and late 20s, but was still a strange aspect of that period of my life.\n\nMany of these opportunities don't have a formal application process.\n    You need to reach out to people.\n    This is a skill, but the basic recipe is to invest in figuring out who it makes sense to reach out to, understanding them, and writing a thoughtful\n    email.\n\nMy life would be in a very different position, were it not for that fact that many people intervened positively and greatly helped me.\n    Michael Nielsen, Yoshua Bengio, Jeff Dean, and Greg Corrado all took significant actions to support my career:\n    Michael mentored me when I was just beginning to do deep learning research and walked me through writing my first paper.\n    Yoshua invited and paid for me to visit MILA in 2013, and managed to get me admitted as a graduate student without an undergrad degree\n    (then I turned him down, which he was very kind about).\n    Jeff took me on as an intern. Greg continued managing me as an intern, and helped me convert to a full-time researcher at Google.\n    This chain of events was possible because the Thiel Fellowship initially gave me two years to work on whatever I wanted.\n\nEqually critical were the many people who supported me outside the context of deep learning research.\n  The hacklab.to community was an incredibly positive part of my life as a teenager, especially\n  Leigh Honeywell, Rob Gilson, Nicholas Dodds, Kate Murphy, Jade Bilkey, Eric Boyd, Madison Kelly, Alex Leitch, Paul Wouters, Sen Nordstrom and Alaina Hardie.\n  I'm also grateful to many professors at the University of Toronto for allowing me to audit courses as a high school student, and then giving me permission to take advanced courses in my one year there.\n  Related to this, I'm lucky that Brad Bass gave me a summer job doing programming at his lab in grade 10 and 11 -- I think I wasn't very useful, but spending months programming full time was great.\n  Too many other people supported me for me to really have any hope of mentioning everyone, but to list some of them:\n  Jen Dodd, Peter Salus,\n  Yomna Nasser,\n  Shai Maharaj,\n  Danielle Strachman,\n  Dario Amodei, Tamsyn Waterhouse, Daniela Amodei, Alex Dingle, Tim Telleen-Lawton, Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman,\n  and\n  Laura Ball.\n\nThanks as well to all those who commented on drafts of this essay including Zan Armstrong, Anja Boskovic, Erin McCloskey, Tom Reid, Deborah Raji, Ria Cheruvu, Emil Wallner, Ali Zaidi, and Danielle Strachman."}

I\n                            do. My close single friends \u2013 both male and female \u2013 generally do. The people I surveyed on\n                            Mechanical Turk do. (Many of the people I surveyed report they would take on\n\nto find a partner!)\n\nYou probably have several friends and acquaintances who are single and would be grateful for\n                            good suggestions on people to meet. (Caveat: thoughtfulness about this is important: there\n                            are\n                            cases where this kind of thing could be uncomfortable or hurtful.) I\u2019ve asked dozens of\n                            single\n                            friends if they\u2019d like me to try and matchmake them or if they\u2019d like an introduction to\n                            someone, and the answer has almost always been yes, and very appreciative.\n\nCan you actually generate good matches? I actually think the probability isn\u2019t that high, but\n                            it\u2019s still very worthwhile in expected value. In particular, I suspect the first few minutes\n                            you\n                            spend thinking about matchmaking is probably really high leverage, with steep diminishing\n                            returns. This is because you have fresh potential matches to consider, while your single\n                            friends\n                            have probably considered everyone who seems like a plausible match that they know.\n\nIn fact, it\n                            wouldn't surprise me at all if in the first hour one spends trying to matchmake, they can\n                            generate something like 10x more\n\nfor\n                            their single friends than those single friends could generate for themselves in an hour.\n\nYour friends probably spend a lot of time and energy seeking a partner, at that much lower\n                            micromarriages per hour return.\n                            I find it pretty exciting to be able to help at such a high multiplier!\n                            (I try to set aside 30-60 min twice a year to systematically think about potential matches.)\n                            Conversely, it's meant the world to me when friends -- and even kind internet strangers --\n                            have tried to set me up.\n\nI suspect that playing matchmaker right now is likely to be unusually impactful. Many of the\n                            mechanisms people rely on to meet potential partners have been disrupted by\n                            COVID.\n                            In a typical year, people have around a 5%/year chance of meeting the person they marry. I\u2019d\n                            guess\n                            it\u2019s been much lower the last two years.\n\nIt won\u2019t\n                            surprise me if the majority of the good I accomplish personally through matchmaking is\n                            accomplished during COVID.\n\nI\u2019ve been deliberately trying to matchmake for around five years. Although I\u2019ve had a few\n                            minor\n                            successes where I introduced people, the only cases where I\u2019ve seen it lead to a\n                            relationship\n                            have been when I\u2019ve schemed together with a friend about setting people up.\n\nMy working model is that the \u201cfuel\u201d of matchmaking is potential matches who haven\u2019t yet\n                            considered whether they should date. The reason you can often be more impactful with a\n                            marginal\n                            hour than your friends can be for themselves is that you know different people. But your\n                            social\n                            network still overlaps a lot with the friend\u2019s you\u2019re trying to match. If you really want to\n                            maximize your probability of suggesting new, potentially really good fits, you want to team\n                            up\n                            with other people who have different social networks.\n\nIn July 2020, I ran a virtual \u201cmatchmaking party\u201d. It was pretty successful. A small group,\n                            in\n                            about two hours, generated a bunch of matches and two eventually led to dating, although I\n                            don\u2019t know\n                            what the long-term relationship outcomes were.\n\nI\u2019m going to run a similar event, you can apply to participate here. Due to COVID, the event\n                            will be virtual.\n\nPlease fill out\n\nto apply.\n\nNo, it's open to any geography. In the sign-up form, you list what geographic regions\n                                you'd\n                                be matching people in. If no one else signs up with overlapping regions, I'll try to let\n                                you\n                                know to save you time if you don't want to join.\n\nIt will be a video call with some mechanism for breaking off into smaller conversations\n                                (maybe Rally?), along with a shared google doc or spreadsheet for listing people you're\n                                trying to match.\n\nOf course! I\u2019d be delighted for you to do so. (I\n                                certainly\n                                can\u2019t host as many matchmaking parties as I think should occur!) After the party, I plan\n                                to\n                                post\n                                templates of all my organizational documents for anyone hosting their own event to use.\n\nI think events for single people are a pretty brutal format. I\u2019ve\n                                gone\n                                to a few in the past myself and found them enormously stressful. The emotional stakes\n                                are\n                                pretty\n                                high for people involved, and that makes them awkward and uncomfortable (especially for\n                                people\n                                who are shy or socially anxious). It also makes things inefficient, because it\u2019s hard\n                                for\n                                people\n                                to just be really honest and rapidly assess compatibility.\n\nIt depends on how big the\n                                group\n                                is.\n                                I\u2019m nervous the structure wouldn\u2019t work very well for a group larger than 20-30 people.\n                                But\n                                I\u2019ll\n                                send everyone who applies all my notes so they can organize their own party!\n\nWe think this will be more effective if people are focused\n                                on\n                                matchmaking others. We want the emotional stakes to be low, and one is generally pretty\n                                invested\n                                in finding a match for themselves. If you\u2019re looking for matches yourself, try to think\n                                about\n                                whether you have any friends you think would be a good matchmaker for you and others!\n                                (And\n                                also\n                                consider if you want to match others \u2013 if finding a match would mean a lot to you,\n                                helping\n                                someone find a match would probably mean an enormous amount to them!)\n\nAs long as you\u2019re focused\n                                on\n                                others, I\u2019d be delighted to have you apply! (I\u2019m single myself, and I really want to\n                                help\n                                other\n                                people who are single find great matches.)\n\nWe expect information shared between matchmakers to be\n                                treated similarly to information found on a dating website. It isn\u2019t strictly private,\n                                but\n                                we\n                                expect people to treat it with care, and to try to act in the best interests of anyone\n                                who\u2019s\n                                information they receive access to.\n\nWell, a lot of them are probably already doing that.\n                                But honestly, I\u2019m pretty negative on dating websites:\n                                they seem to structurally encourage a lot\n                                of unhealthy things, and I think the\n\nreturn is probably\n                                worse than lots of other things. My guess is that introductions from friends are\n                                literally\n                                an order of magnitude better.\n\nIt\u2019s always seemed to me\n                                like\n                                professional matchmakers paid for by individual clients have uncomfortable incentives\n                                (the\n                                same\n                                could be said of dating websites). I\u2019m pretty excited about the idea of professional\n                                matchmakers\n                                who are operating in a more \u201cnon-profit\u201d style where they're funded by donations\n                                intended to\n                                support them generally rather than find matches for a specific person. (In fact, last\n                                year I\n                                made a $10K donation to someone experimenting with this!) But I think it\u2019s unlikely this\n                                is\n                                going to occur in a widespread enough way to help most of my or your friends in the near\n                                future.\n\nSorry, I only expect to be able to make helpful matches\n                                for\n                                people I know fairly well. (If I do know you but don\u2019t know that you\u2019re looking for a\n                                partner,\n                                please let me know!) Consider who the best person in your social circle to act as a\n                                matchmaker\n                                would be and send them this event!"}

When I was\n                            18, I dropped out of university to support a friend accused of terrorism, because I believe\n                            it\u2019s most important to support people when others don\u2019t. When he was found innocent, I\n                            noticed that deep learning was going to affect society, and dedicated myself to figuring out\n                            how humans could understand neural networks. I\u2019ve spent the last decade working on that\n                            because I think it could be one of the keys to making AI safe.\n\nServing others and working on important problems is a privilege, but it isn't the only thing\n                            I want in life.\n                            More than almost anything, I want to have a family: to have a partner and children to share\n                            life with.\n                            I\u2019ve been lucky to date several wonderful women, but it\u2019s always turned out we weren\u2019t quite\n                            looking for the same things. And so I wanted to try an experiment: simply trying to describe\n                            myself and the life I hope to build with a partner as earnestly, openly, and honestly as I\n                            possibly can, so that someone can reach out if what I\u2019ve written resonates.\n\nI\u2019d be delighted if we\n                            could increase the chances for each other, even just a little bit. If you think we might be\n                            a fit, I\u2019d love to do a video call or go on a walk and just chat about interesting things.\n\nYou can DM me\n\n(DMs open!) or send me an\n                            email at\n\n.\n                            Feel free to just tell me about some part of this document that resonated with you. :)\n\nYou\u2019re also very welcome to try and play matchmaker if you know someone else you think I\u2019d be\n                            compatible with.\n\nAwkward selfie at my favorite park. But gosh,\n                                isn\u2019t San Francisco beautiful?\n\nThere are some topics which are close to my heart. Dreams and ideas which spark my excited\n                            enthusiasm. Facts about the world which trigger an earnest drive to help. These topics feel\n                            close to who I am, woven into my soul. When I\u2019m around others who share similar feelings,\n                            part of me opens up. I am more myself, and can form deeper connections.\n\nA formative experience for me has been moral loneliness. As a young child, I was upset about\n                            how animals are treated but didn\u2019t know anyone with similar beliefs. As a teenager, I\n                            struggled with the Bible and became an atheist. But becoming an atheist left me alone in\n                            caring intensely about global poverty (this is something I still admire about the church I\n                            grew up in). As an adult, I\u2019m lucky to have found friends and community with similar values\n                            but\u2026 I\u2019d really love to find moral connection in a relationship.\n\nWhat do I mean by \u201cmoral connection\u201d? I don\u2019t mean believing all the same things: the last\n                            thing I\u2019d want would be for either of us to feel constrained in our independent moral\n                            judgment! But I think it would be lovely to have enough shared fundamental values to not\n                            feel alone, and to really see and value in each other our efforts to be good people. (I\n                            suspect an important part of balancing moral independence and connection is\n\n.)\n\nWhat are my values? I try \u2013 although I obviously don't always live up to this \u2013 to be\n                            genuinely truth-seeking, care about the welfare of all humans and animals, and be willing to\n                            act to improve them. I viscerally care about animal welfare and global poverty. I work on AI\n                            safety because I think there's a serious risk of it being unsafe. (Many values I hold are\n                            associated with Effective Altruism. However, there are also some things I'd disagree with\n                            the EA mainstream on, and I generally value moral independence.)\n\nI\u2019m not sure how exactly to articulate this, but I feel like the default trajectory of my\n                            life is to optimize it for efficiency and impact. Those are meaningful things to me \u2013\n                            especially as they relate to helping the world \u2013 but I don\u2019t want that to be the entirety of\n                            my life. I also don\u2019t want to get pulled into consumerism, or hedonism, or lots of other\n                            lifestyle attractors around me. Instead, I\u2019m \u2013 confusedly, graspingly, stumbling \u2013 trying to\n                            find something related to family, and connection, and reflection, and integrity.\n                            Wholesomeness.\n\nSomehow this idea of seeking \u201cwholesomeness\u201d feels very intertwined with relationships. I\n                            guess because \u201cfamily\u201d feels like a central part of it? Or because many of these things feel\n                            most meaningful when you\u2019re sharing them with someone?\n\nI\u2019m not really sure what it would look like for us to try and find wholesomeness in this\n                            sense. It\u2019s something we\u2019d need to find out together! Maybe we should live in a village with\n                            friends. Maybe we should build a home and live in the woods. Maybe we should drink tea every\n                            morning together as the sun rises. Maybe it\u2019s smaller subtle things. But if the vague thing\n                            I\u2019m gesturing at resonates with you, I\u2019d at least be an enthusiastic partner as we stumble\n                            towards it together.\n\nAside: I really like\n\nas one\n                            possible vision of \u201cwholesomeness\u201d, in particular threads that just have pictures of his\n                            family and their home.\n\nI find math deeply beautiful, and I get a lot of meaning out of it. This is true of science\n                            broadly as well, although to a somewhat lesser extent. I get a lot of joy out of learning\n                            and exploring and being curious and discovering. I\u2019d love to share that with you. I\u2019d love\n                            to work through a textbook we both find interesting, or research some topic, or do a small\n                            project. I\u2019d love to whiteboard, and share what we\u2019re thinking about, and be curious about\n                            the world together.\n\n(It\u2019s worth saying that this isn\u2019t necessarily an easy thing to do. I think a lot of people\n                            who are very intellectual can feel intellectually insecure talking to their partner. What if\n                            they say something \u201cdumb\u201d and their partner rejects them intellectually? But I think if we\n                            want to, we can work together to have an environment that\u2019s safe and allows us to explore\n                            ideas together.)\n\n... I also just find it really attractive when someone is genuinely fascinated by math or\n                            science. I'm usually slow to develop crushes, but a striking exception was an occasion when\n                            someone at a party rambled to me about cool biology papers they'd read recently for half an\n                            hour. Instant crush.\n\nMore than almost anything, I\u2019m excited to have a family with a partner someday. I\u2019m excited\n                            to do it with a particular set of motivations: to have a family, not just because it\u2019s a\n                            thing people do by default, but because it\u2019s an adventure we\u2019re both deeply excited for and\n                            invested in. To be trying to learn, together, how to make it beautiful and meaningful and\n                            alive, even when there are tricky moments. (To be clear: I fully expect having children to\n                            have lots of unpleasant and exhausting parts!)\n\nI\u2019m excited to have children, but I\u2019m even more excited to have children with someone. When I\n                            imagine it, a big part of what I\u2019m looking forward to is sharing it as a powerful, deep\n                            connection to my partner. Just the thought that there\u2019s a small possibility that a\n                            relationship might someday lead to having children with someone gives me an almost\n                            intoxicating sense of connection.\n\nI love going on walks after it rains. These photos were all taken at a\n                                park near my house. I\u2019d love to show you if we end up dating!\n\nIt\u2019s often unclear why relationships don\u2019t work out, but here are a few things I think were\n                            factors, in case they can help us avoid similar incompatibilities:\n\nDating profiles can be highly polished pictures of someone. I\u2019ve tried very hard to be\n                            earnest, but even so it\u2019s a very limited view. Thankfully, I have years of a pretty\n                            extensive online presence that might offer a more holistic picture. One starting point might\n                            be the\n\nand\n\n, or this\n\n. For a more unfiltered view, you could look at my\n\n(I think replies are\n                            more unfiltered than normal tweets) and go back through history.\n\nA friend suggested I should include a list of books I\u2019ve read. This turned into a whole\n                            additional doc. :)"}

I\u2019ve returned from holiday travels and am settling back into work for 2025. Here are three, quick, bookish recommendations from links that have crossed my desk recently.\n\nFirst, a newsletter: Katie Clapham\u2019s\n\nis a new favorite of mine.\n\nKatie runs an independent bookshop in Lancashire, and every Friday when she opens the shop she also starts a new draft of the newsletter. Throughout the day she fills it up with commentary on running a bookshop in these modern times, quips from the shoppers, witty observations, a record of books sold and purchased, etc. At the end of the day, she closes the shop and sends the newsletter.\n\nOne of my favorite genres of art is \u201ctotally mundane but fascinating and engaging for reasons that are hard to explain,\u201d and Receipt from the Bookshop fits that bill perfectly.\n\nMore than just being fascinating, though, it\u2019s a good reminder for us all how creativity and fulfillment as a writer\n\ncome from mundanity. There is beauty in the mundane! We can find it if we look hard enough.\n\nWhatever this is: more of it please.\n\nBooks are powerful cultural artifacts, and so much of human history is wound around them. It should be no surprise then that notebooks carry a similar significance.\n\nWell that\u2019s just what Roland Allen\u2019s book,\n\n, is all about. I picked it up recently after seeing it recommended by a few folks in their 2024 reading recaps.\n\nThe cast of historical characters that pop up throughout the book is a lot of fun, and the author does a great job of showing just how critical notebooks were to the development of civilization and culture as we know it today.\n\nAnother truly great example of something unassuming (notebooks) being explored with a contagious enthusiasm. There is, repeatedly, poetry in the mundane.\n\nBy the way, I love reading books which tell history non-linearly through the lens of ultra-niche subtopics. Another great example that comes to mind is\n\nby James Crawford. Books and buildings both make great portals back in time.\n\nFinally, a celebration of the book collectors, dealers, sellers, and conservators who preserve the art of books and bring the most important ones along into the future.\n\nWhile reading The Notebook: A History, I stumbled upon a 2019 documentary that resonated on the same frequency.\n\n, which (from what I can tell) has recently been made\n\n, focuses primarily on rare book dealers in New York City and their bookshops, and it\u2019s a visual feast for book lovers. But more importantly it\u2019s an homage to those still dedicating their lives to preserving the written word and the book as a form.\n\nThere\u2019s a clear and present danger to the world of books that is felt palpably in the documentary, with many sellers and collectors worried about a diminishing market for book collectors. There are also those in the film who see a bright future. It\u2019s nice to hear both takes.\n\nAs for myself, I am a huge fan of collecting physical books, and maintain a\n\nwhich you can browse if you\u2019d like. Whether you collect books or not, I recommend giving The Booksellers a watch."}
{"url": "https://chsmc.org/2023/03/weblogs-as-a-form/", "origin": "https://chasem.co/thoughts/", "title": "How blogs shaped the web | Chase McCoy", "content": "I have a lot of nostalgia for the era of blogging that I grew up with during the first decade or so of the 2000s.\n\nOf course there was a ton of great content about technology and internet culture, but more importantly to me it was a time of great commentary and experimentation on the form of blogging and publishing.\n\nAs social media and smartphones were weaving their ways into our lives, there was a group of bloggers constructing their own worlds. Before Twitter apps and podcast clients became the UI playgrounds of most designers, it was personal sites and weblogs that were pioneering the medium.\n\nLooking back, this is probably where my meta-fascination with the web came from. For me the most interesting part has always been the part analyzing and discussing itself.\n\nRobin Sloan puts it well (as he is wont to do):\n\nBack in the 2000s, a lot of blogs were about blogs, about blogging. If that sounds exhaustingly meta, well, yes\u200a\u2014\u200abut it was also SUPER generative. When the thing can describe itself, when it becomes the natural place to discuss and debate itself, I\u00a0am telling you: some flywheel gets spinning, and powerful things start to\u00a0happen.\n\nDesign, programming, and writing started for me on the web. I can recall the progression from a plain text editor to the Tumblr theme editor to learning self-hosted WordPress.\n\nAll of that was driven by the desire to tinker and experiment with the web\u2019s form. How many ways could you design a simple weblog? What different formats were possible that no one had imagined before?\n\nEarlier this week I listened to\n\nand was delighted to hear them discuss this very topic. Jason is one of the original innovators of the blog form, and I\u2019ve been following his blog, kottke.org, since I was old enough to care about random shit on the internet.\n\n, and Jason has been publishing online for even longer than that. All along the way, he has experimented with the form of content on the web. He\u2019s not alone in that\u2014many bloggers like him have helped to mold the internet into what it is today. The ones that influenced me besides kottke.org are\n\n,\n\n, Jim Coudal and\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n, and more that I\u2019m certainly forgetting.\n\n, and my personal favorite design of the site over the years\n\nJason and John have an interesting conversation during the podcast (starting around 25 minutes in) about how the first few generations of bloggers on the web defined its shape. Moving from print to digital mediums afforded a labyrinth of new avenues to explore.\n\nIt\u2019s always important to remind ourselves that many of the things we take for granted today on the web and in digital design had to be invented by someone.\n\nEarly weblogs did not immediately arrive at the conclusion of chronological streams\u2014some broke content up into \u201cissues\u201d, some simply changed the content of their homepages entirely.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until later that the reverse-chronological, paginated-or-endless scrolling list of entries was introduced and eventually became the de-facto presentation of content on the web. That standard lives on today in the design of Twitter, Instagram, etc., and it\u2019s fascinating to see that tradition fading away as more sites embrace algorithmic feeds.\n\nBy the way, I\u2019d be remiss here if I didn\u2019t mention Amy Hoy\u2019s amazing piece\n\n. Comparing the title of her piece with the title of this one, it\u2019s clear that not everyone sees this shift in form as a positive one, but she does a great job in outlining the history and the role that blogs played in shaping the form of the web. Her particular focus on early content management systems like Movable Type is fascinating.\n\nAnother great example that Jason and John discuss on the podcast is the idea of titling blog posts.\n\nThey point out that many early sites didn\u2019t use titles for blog posts, a pattern which resembles the future form of Tweets, Facebook posts, text messages, and more. But the rise of RSS readers, many of which made the assumption that entries have titles and design their UIs around that, forced many bloggers to add titles to their posts to work well in the environment so popular with their readers.\n\nJason mentions that this was one of the driving factor for kottke.org to start adding titles to posts!\n\nThis is an incredible example of the medium shaping the message, where the UI design of RSS readers heavily influenced the form of content being published. When optimizing for the web, those early bloggers and the social networks of today both arrived at the same conclusion\u2014titles are unnecessary and add an undue burden to publishing content.\n\nThis difference is the very reason why sending an email feels heavier than sending a tweet. Bloggers not using titles on their blog posts figured out tweeting long before Twitter did.\n\nWhen referring to the early bloggers at suck.com, Jason said something that I think describes this entire revolution pretty well.\n\n[\u2026]there was in information to be gotten from not only what they linked to, but how they linked to it, which word they decided to make the hyperlink.\n\nIt\u2019s not often that you have an entirely new stylistic primitive added to your writing toolbox. For decades you could bold, italicize, underline, uppercase, footnote, etc. and all of a sudden something entirely new\u2014the hyperlink.\n\nWith linking out to other sites being such a core part of blogging, it\u2019s no surprise that the interaction design of linking was largely discussed and experimented with.\n\ndiscussing all the ways that various blogs of the time handled posts primary geared towards linking to and commenting on other sites.\n\nAnother similar example is URL slugs\u2014the short string of text at the end of a web address identifying a single post. For many of my favorite bloggers, the URL slug is a small but subtle way to convey a message that may\n\nthe same as the message of the post itself. One other stylistic primitive unique to the web.\n\nThe different ways in which bloggers designed their site or linked to words became a part of their unique style, and it gave their each of them an entirely new way to express themselves.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to communicate how grateful I feel for this era of experimentation on the web, and specifically for Jason Kottke\u2019s influence on me as a designer. The past 25 years have been a special time to experience the internet.\n\nThere was a time when I thought my career might be curved towards blogging full-time and running my own version of something like kottke.org. Through exploring that I found my way to what I really loved\u2014design and software. My work continues to benefit from what I learned studying bloggers and publishers online.\n\nWhether you care much about writing or not, I encourage you to have a blog. Write about what interests you, take great care of how you present it to the world, and you might be surprised where it takes you. There are new forms around every corner."}
{"url": "https://d.sb/2009/04", "origin": "https://d.sb/blog", "title": "Daniel15's Blog \u2014 Daniel15", "content": "So, I was reading the news today, and came across\n\n. It states:\n\nTHE NSW Federal Court has not ruled out the possibility that an ISP could be in direct breach of copyright laws if\n\n.\n\nA group of copyright holders represented by the Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft (AFACT) put the claim to the court as a part of its copyright case against Perth-headquartered ISP iiNet.\n\nMost of AFACT\u2019s original claims against iiNet lodged with the court last year were based on allegations that the ISP indirectly breached their members\u2019 copyright. They alleged that iiNet effectively encouraged customers to engage in copyright breaches by failing to take steps to block illegal file sharing activity on its network.\n\nHowever, on February 19, AFACT lodged an amended statement of claim to the court containing new allegations that iiNet engaged in primary acts of copyright infringement alongside illegal file sharers\n\n.\n\n(bold by me)\n\nThis is totally stupid! Why should an ISP be responsible for the data it's carrying? Why is the electricity company not responsible? They're supplying the power to the systems mentioned, so they also provide services to people that illegally share files. What about the building company that built the houses/offices? They're responsible for housing the systems.\n\nThe thing is, ISPs\n\nknow what the data being transferred on their network actually is. Much like the postal service... When you send a letter to someone, they don't open your letter and read it, they just send it. If I send you a terrible analogy that makes you think \"oh my God, this guy needs to take lessons on writing\", that's not Australia Post's issue. The postal service, and the ISP, are just transport agents. They send mesages from one location to another, but are\n\nfor the\n\nof the messages. Saying that the ISP is responsible for illegal file sharers because their network is being used is like saying that VicRoads is responsible for criminals, because they're driving their cars on the roads. Clearly, this makes absolutely no sense. If you go to VicRoads and tell them to put tollbooths on the roads to identify every person driving to make sure they're not a criminal, they'd laugh at you. The ISPs should be doing the same thing \u2014 This is exactly what's being asked of them.\n\nAlso, the article said that the ISP would be responsible if \"\n\n\". How are they meant to know that individuals illegally share files? Note that ISPs\n\ndisconnect users they get copyright complaints about (how users are caught is a different issue altogether... Fake torrents and similar things. Might blog about this eventually). There's really no other way for them to know who illegally shares files. This sentence makes it sound like they want ISPs to add a \"Do you illegally share files\" tickbox on the registration form. \ud83d\ude1b\n\nAnd also, as Aaron\n\n, \"copyright theft\" makes no sense. The term they're actually looking for is \"copyright\n\n\". But, they seem to barely know what they're doing, so I guess the use of a nonsensical term makes sense in whatever magical land they're living in. A land where there's no Peer-to-Peer networks, and everyone pays for the latest crappy music albums and TV shows and whatever else exists. For now, the rest of us live in reality, where none of this filtering is possible.\n\n\u2014 Daniel\n\nWell, back to posting coding-related blog posts, for now anyways \ud83d\ude1b. Seeing as a lot of people seem to be confused by Object Oriented Programming, I thought I'd post a quick (or maybe not so quick) post about what OOP is, the main features, and how it can benefit you. This is paraphrased from an assignment I had on OOP last semester at university. I use C# code examples throughout this, but the concepts are very similar in other languages. Note that in this post, I assume you know the basics of programming, and just want to learn more about object orientation.\n\nNow, let's begin looking at what OOP actually means. At its core, the Object Oriented paradigm consists of\n\nand\n\n. A class is a \u201cthing\u201d or entity that has a purpose, and an\n\nis an instance of this entity. For example, a Car would be a class, and\n\nwould be an object (instance of the Car class)."}

Things have been excellent so far, it's been really enjoyable. Last week, we made some\n\n. They were pretty much just plain lemon cookies based on a recipe from a $4 book we bought at Go-Lo, WITH A DIFFERENCE! We made them awesome by colouring them all different colours (and even made some multi-colour, which was my idea \ud83d\ude04). They were delicious\n\ncolourful and made with 100% awesomesauce. Next time we make some, we'll make them all rainbow I think xD.\n\nYesterday (Saturday), we went to\n\n, which is a science museum here in Melbourne. Well, we got there eventually. We had a few minor issues along the way. Firstly, we got off at Parliament Train Station (as the Metlink journey planner said to), and the platform that the train we needed usually comes to was closed, and there was a notice to go to Southern Cross Station. So, we went back to the platform we came from, and caught another train to Southern Cross. When we got to Southern Cross, the train took aaaages to come (then again, it's the Weribee line so it's kinda expected I guess \ud83d\ude1b). And then there was another complication \u2014 The train terminated at Footscray and we had to take a replacement bus the rest of the way. However, once we caught that bus, we finally got there. Entry is free if you're a student, so that's definitely a bonus.\n\nWhile I've been to Scienceworks before, it was a long long time ago and I couldn't remember much of it. This time around it was pretty good and I found it quite interesting.  They had a toy exhibit, which was\n\n! They had a roller coaster made out of\n\nwhich was very nice. I want one!! Get me one please? I'm such a child at times, I don't think that'll ever change \ud83d\ude04. Anyways, there was also other exhibits like a flight simulator, a kitchen thingy and a nice fire show (with demonstrations, Aaron would have loved it xD). There's also a planetarium there, but we didn't go this time (maybe we'll go next time). And we also went to the store there, and bought some glow-in-the-dark stars (which we stuck all over the roof in our room \ud83d\ude04). All in all, it was a very fun day, I really enjoyed it! Was definitely worth the $0 entry to Scienceworks, hahaha \ud83d\ude1b.\n\nAs for work, things are going very good. Since I just passed the six month mark for my IBL placement, I moved from the technical support team at work into one of the development teams. We've been working on improving our products by making commonly-requested upgrades. When clients would like functionality that is currently not available in our system, their request goes onto a wishlist. My team went through the wishlist, rated all the items based on priority, and started working on them. In just two weeks, we've completed heaps, and a few people are very happy \ud83d\ude04! I've also been doing a few other things, it's been quite good. I really enjoy my job! Also since it's about the half way mark now, my mid-placement report is nearly due. I've nearly finished it, just have to confirm that it's alright, and show it to my supervisor and see if he thinks it's alright.\n\nSo it's the start of another week tomorrow. I really miss Ciera during the day while I'm at work, but it's awesome coming home to her! Really makes me happy and makes everything I do worth it. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nUntil next time,\n\n\u2014 Daniel\n\nSo, my girlfriend Ciera came back to Melbourne last Saturday (26th June 2010)! We've been having a\n\ntime so far, I'm so very glad to see her again! I honestly don't think I would have been able to wait much longer, so I'm extremely happy that she came her when she did. It's been a week since she got here, and things have already been so amazing! I think she's been enjoying it here heaps (I know she loves it in Australia), and I've certainly enjoyed it. Today we just did a bit of shopping, nothing too big. Bought a bookshelf to put all our books and stuff on \ud83d\ude1b\n\nI can't wait for what the future is going to bring us!\n\nUntil next time,\n\n\u2014 Daniel"}
{"url": "https://dave.cheney.net/2020/02", "origin": "https://dave.cheney.net", "title": "February | 2020 | Dave Cheney", "content": ".\n\nSomething that I\u2019ve been thinking about a lot recently, when reflecting on the body of my own work, is a common subtitle,\n\nGiven nobody actively seeks to write\n\ncode, this leads to the question;\n\nIf there\u2019s a continuum between good and bad, how to do we know what the good parts are? What are its properties, its attributes, its hallmarks, its patterns, and its idioms?\n\nWhich brings me to idiomatic Go. To say that something is idiomatic is to say that it follows the style of the time. If something is not idiomatic, it is not following the prevailing style. It is unfashionable.\n\nMore importantly, to say to someone that their code is not idiomatic does not explain\n\nit\u2019s not idiomatic. Why is this? Like all truths, the answer is found in the dictionary.\n\nidiom (noun): a group of words established by usage as having a meaning not deducible from those of the individual words.\n\nIdioms are hallmarks of shared values. Idiomatic Go is not something you learn from a book, it\u2019s something that you acquire by being part of a community.\n\nMy concern with the mantra of idiomatic Go is, in many ways, it can be exclusionary. It\u2019s saying \u201cyou can\u2019t sit with us.\u201d After all, isn\u2019t that what we mean when critique of someone\u2019s work as non-idiomatic? They didn\u2019t do It right. It doesn\u2019t look right. It doesn\u2019t follow the style of time.\n\nI offer that idiomatic Go is not a suitable mechanism for teaching how to write good Go code because it is defined, fundamentally, by telling someone they did it wrong. Wouldn\u2019t it be better if the advice we gave didn\u2019t alienate the author right at the point they were most willing to accept it?\n\nStepping away problematic idioms, what other cultural artefacts do Gophers have? Perhaps we can turn to Rob Pike\u2019s wonderful\n\n. Are these suitable teaching tools? Will these tell newcomers how to write good Go code?\n\nIn general, I don\u2019t think so. This is not to dismiss Pike\u2019s work, it is just that the Go Proverbs, like Segoe Kensaku\u2019s original, are observations, not statements of value. Again, the dictionary comes to the rescue:\n\nproverb (noun): a short, well-known pithy saying, stating a general truth or piece of advice.\n\nThe goal of the Go Proverbs are to reveal a deeper truth about the design of the language, but how useful is advice like the\n\nto a novice from a language that doesn\u2019t have structural typing?\n\nIt\u2019s important to recognise that, in a growing community, at any time the people learning Go far outnumber those who claim to have mastered the language. Thus proverbs are perhaps not the best teaching tool in this scenario.\n\nDan Luu found\n\nby Mark Lucovsky about the engineering culture of the windows team around the windows NT-windows 2000 timeframe. The reason I mention it is Lukovsky\u2019s description of a culture as a common way of evaluating designs and making tradeoffs.\n\nThere are many ways of discussing culture, but with respect to an engineering culture Lucovsky\u2019s description is apt. The central idea is\n\n. The values of the NT team were; portability, reliability, security, and extensibility. Engineering values are, crudely translated, the way things are done around here.\n\nWhat are the explicit values of Go? What are the core beliefs or philosophy that define the way a Go programmer interprets the world? How are they promulgated? How are they taught? How are they enforced? How do they change over time?\n\nHow will you, as a newly minted Go programmer, inculcate the engineering values of Go? Or, how will you, a seasoned Go professional promulgate your values to a future generations? And just so we\u2019re clear, this process of knowledge transfer is not optional. Without new blood and new ideas, our community become myopic and wither.\n\nTo set the scene for what I\u2019m getting at we can look to other languages we see examples of their engineering values.\n\nFor example, C++ (and by extension Rust) believe that a programmer\n\n. If a program does not use some computationally expensive feature of the language, then it shouldn\u2019t be forced to shoulder the cost of that feature. This value extends from the language, to its standard library, and is used as a yardstick for judging the design of all code written in C++.\n\nIn Java, and Ruby, and Smalltalk, the core value that\n\ndrives the design of programs around message passing, information hiding, and polymorphism. Designs that shoehorn a procedural style, or even a functional style, into these languages are considered to be wrong\u2013or as Gophers would say, non idiomatic.\n\nTurning to our own community, what are the engineering values that bind Go programmers? Discourse in our community is often fractious, so deriving a set of values from first principles would be a formidable challenge. Consensus is critical, but exponentially more difficult as the number of contributors to the discussion increases. But what if someone had done the hard work for us.\n\nSeveral decades ago Tim Peters sat down and penned\n\n, the Zen of Python. Peters\u2019 attempted to document the engineering values that he saw Guido van Rossum apply in his role as BDFL for Python.\n\nFor the remainder of this article, I\u2019m going to look towards the Zen of Python and ask, is there anything that can inform the engineering values of Go programmers?\n\nLet\u2019s start with something spicy,\n\n\u201cNamespaces are one honking great idea\u2013let\u2019s do more of those!\u201d\n\nThis is pretty unequivocal, Python programmers should use namespaces. Lots of them.\n\nIn Go parlance a namespace is a package. I doubt there is any question that grouping things into packages is good for design and potentially reuse. But there might be some confusion, especially if you\u2019re coming with a decade of experience in another language, about the right way to do this.\n\nIn Go each package should have a purpose, and the best way to know a package\u2019s purpose is by its name\u2014a noun. A package\u2019s name describes what it provides. So too reinterpret Peters\u2019 words, every Go package should have a single purpose.\n\nThis is not a new idea,\n\n, but why should you do this rather than approach where packages are used for fine grained taxonomy? Why, because change.\n\n\u201cDesign is the art of arranging code to work today, and be changeable forever.\u201d\n\nChange is the name of the game we\u2019re in. What we do as programmers is manage change. When we do that well we call it design, or architecture. When we do it badly we call it technical debt, or legacy code.\n\nIf you are writing a program that works perfectly, one time, for one fixed set of inputs then nobody cares if the code is good or bad because ultimately the output of the program is all the business cares about.\n\nBut this is\n\ntrue. Software has bugs, requirements change, inputs change, and very few programs are written solely to be executed once, thus your program\n\nchange over time. Maybe it\u2019s you who\u2019ll be tasked with this, more likely it will be someone else, but someone has to change that code. Someone has to maintain that code.\n\nSo, how can we make it easy to for programs to change? Interfaces everywhere? Make everything mockable? Pernicious dependency injection? Well, maybe, for some classes of programs, but not many, those techniques will be useful. However, for the majority of programs, designing something to be flexible up front is over engineering.\n\nWhat if, instead, we take a position that rather than enhancing components, we replace them. Then the best way to know when something needs to be replaced, is when it doesn\u2019t do what it says on the tin.\n\nA good package starts with choosing a good name. Think of your package\u2019s name as an elevator pitch, using just one word, to describe what it provides. When the name no longer matches the requirement, find a replacement.\n\n\u201cSimple is better than complex.\u201d\n\nPEP-20 says simple is better than complex, I couldn\u2019t agree more. A couple of years ago I made this tweet;\n\nMy observation, at least at the time, was that I couldn\u2019t think of a language introduced in my life time that didn\u2019t purport to be simple. Each new language offered as a justification, and an enticement, their inherent simplicity. But as I researched, I found that simplicity was not a core value of the many of the languages considered Go\u2019s contemporaries.\n\nMaybe this is just a cheap shot, but could it be that either these languages aren\u2019t simple, or they don\u2019t\n\nof themselves as being simple. They don\u2019t consider simplicity to be a core value.\n\nCall me old fashioned, but when did being simple fall out of style? Why does the commercial software development industry continually, gleefully, forget this fundamental truth?\n\n\u201cThere are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult.\u201d\n\nSimple does not mean easy, we know that. Often it is more work to make something simple to use, than easy to build.\n\n\u201cSimplicity is prerequisite for reliability.\u201d\n\nWhy should we strive for simplicity? Why is important that Go programs be simple? Simple doesn\u2019t mean crude, it means readable and maintainable. Simple doesn\u2019t mean unsophisticated, it means reliable, relatable, and understandable.\n\n\u201cControlling complexity is the essence of computer programming.\u201d\n\nWhether Python abides by its mantra of simplicity is a matter for debate, but Go holds simplicity as a core value. I think that we can all agree that when it comes to Go, simple code is preferable to clever code.\n\n\u201cExplicit is better than implicit.\u201d\n\nThis is a place where I think Peters\u2019 was more aspirational than factual. Many things in Python are not explicit; decorators, dunder methods, and so on. Without doubt they are powerful, there\u2019s a reason those features exists. Each feature is something someone cared enough about to do the work to implement it, especially the complicated ones. But heavy use of those features makes is harder for the reader to predict the cost of an operation.\n\nThe good news is we have a choice, as Go programmers, to choose to make our code explicit. Explicit could mean many things, perhaps you may be thinking explicit is just a nice way of saying bureaucratic and long winded, but that\u2019s a superficial interpretation. It\u2019s a misnomer to focus only on the syntax on the page, to fret about line lengths and DRYing up expressions. The more valuable, in my opinon, place to be explicit are to do with coupling and with state.\n\nCoupling is a measure of the amount one thing depends on another. If two things are tightly coupled, they move together. An action that affects one is directly reflected in another. Imagine a train, each carriage joined\u2013ironically the correct word is coupled\u2013together; where the engine goes, the carriages follow.\n\nAnother way to describe coupling is the word cohesion. Cohesion measures how well two things naturally belong together. We talk about a cohesive argument, or a cohesive team; all their parts fit together as if they were designed that way.\n\nWhy does coupling matter? Because just like trains, when you need to change a piece of code, all the code that is tightly coupled to it must change. A prime example, someone release a new version of their API and now your code doesn\u2019t compile.\n\nAPIs are an unavoidable source of coupling but there are more insidious forms of coupling. Clearly everyone knows that if an API\u2019s signature changes the data passing into and out of that call changes. It\u2019s right there in the signature of the function; I take values of these types and return values of other types. But what if the API passed data another way? What if every time you called this API the result was based on the previous time you called that API even though you didn\u2019t change your parameters.\n\nThis is state, and management of state is\n\nproblem in computer science.\n\nSuppose we have this simple\n\npackage. You can call\n\nto increment the counter, you can even get the value back if you\n\nwith a value of zero.\n\nSuppose you had to test this code, how would you reset the counter after each test? Suppose you wanted to run those tests in parallel, could you do it? Now suppose that you wanted to count more than one thing per program, could you do it?\n\nNo, of course not. Clearly the answer is to encapsulate the\n\nvariable in a type.\n\nNow imagine that this problem isn\u2019t restricted to just counters, but your applications main business logic. Can you test it in isolation? Can you test it in parallel? Can you use more than one instance at a time? If the answer those question is\n\n, the reason is package level state.\n\nAvoid package level state. Reduce coupling and spooky action at a distance by providing the dependencies a type needs as fields on that type rather than using package variables.\n\n\u201cErrors should never pass silently.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been said of languages that favour exception handling follow the Samurai principle;\n\n. In exception based languages functions only return valid results. If they don\u2019t succeed then control flow takes an entirely different path.\n\nUnchecked exceptions are clearly an unsafe model to program in. How can you possibly write code that is robust in the presence of errors when you don\u2019t know which statements could throw an exception? Java tried to make exceptions safer by introducing the notion of a checked exception which, to the best of my knowledge, has not been repeated in another mainstream language. There are plenty of languages which use exceptions but they all, with the singular exception of Java, do so in the unchecked variety.\n\nObviously Go chose a different path. Go programmers believe that robust programs are composed from pieces that handle the failure cases\n\nthey handle the happy path. In the space that Go was designed for; server programs, multi threaded programs, programs that handle input over the network, dealing with unexpected data, timeouts, connection failures and corrupted data must be front and centre of the programmer\u2019s mind if they are to produce robust programs.\n\n\u201cI think that error handling should be explicit, this should be a core value of the language.\u201d\n\nI want to echo Peter\u2019s assertion, as it was the impetus for this article. I think so much of the success of Go is due to the explicit way errors are handled. Go programmers thinks about the failure case first. We solve the \u201cwhat if\u2026\u200b\u201d case first. This leads to programs where failures are handled at the point of writing, rather than the point they occur in production.\n\nThe verbosity of\n\nis outweighed by the value of deliberately handling each failure condition at the point at which they occur. Key to this is the cultural value of handling each and every error explicitly.\n\n\u201cFlat is better than nested.\u201d\n\nThis is sage advice coming from a language where indentation is the primary form of control flow. How can we interpret this advice in terms of Go?\n\ncontrols the overall whitespace of a Go program so there\u2019s not thing doing there.\n\nI wrote earlier about package names, and there is probably some advice here about avoiding a complicated package hierarchy. In my experience the more a programmer tries to subdivide and taxonimise their Go codebase the more they risk hitting the dead end that is package import loops.\n\nI think the best application of item 5\u2019s advice is the control flow\n\na function. Simply put, avoid control flow that requires deep indentation.\n\n\u201cLine of sight is a straight line along which an observer has unobstructed vision.\u201d\n\nMat Ryer describes this idea as line of sight coding. Light of sight coding means things like:\n\nKey to this advice is the thing that you care about, the thing that the function does, is never in danger of sliding out of sight to the right of your screen. This style has a bonus side effect that you\u2019ll avoid pointless arguments about line lengths on your team.\n\nEvery time you indent you add another precondition to the programmers stack, consuming one of their 7 \u00b12 short term memory slots. Rather than nesting deeply, keep the successful path of the function close to the left hand side of your screen.\n\n\u201cIn the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.\u201d\n\nProgramming is based on mathematics and logic, two concepts which rarely involve the element of chance. But there are many things we, as programmers, guess about every day. What does this variable do? What does this parameter do? What happens if I pass\n\nhere? What happens if I call\n\ntwice? There\u2019s actually a lot of guesswork in modern programming, especially when it comes to using libraries you didn\u2019t write.\n\n\u201cAPIs should be easy to use and hard to misuse.\u201d\n\nOne of the best ways I know to help a programmer avoid having to guess is to, when building an API,\n\n. Make it as easy as you can for the caller to do the most common thing. However, I\u2019ve written and talked a lot about API design in the past, so instead my interpretation of item 12 is;\n\n.\n\nDespite how you may feel about Knuth\u2019s advice, one of the drivers of Go\u2019s success is its efficient execution. You can write efficient programs in Go and thus people\n\nchoose Go because of this. There are a lot of misconceptions about performance, so my request is, when you\u2019re looking to performance tune your code or you\u2019re facing some dogmatic advice like defer is slow, CGO is expensive, or always use atomics not mutexes, don\u2019t guess.\n\nDon\u2019t complicate your code because of outdated dogma, and, if you think something is slow, first prove it with a benchmark. Go has excellent benchmarking and profiling tools that come in the distribution for free. Use them to find your bottlenecks.\n\nAt this point I think I think I\u2019ve mined the valuable points from PEP-20 and possibly stretched its reinterpretation beyond the point of good taste. I think that\u2019s fine, because although this was a useful rhetorical device, ultimately we are talking about two different languages.\n\n\u201cYou type g o, a space, and then a function call. Three keystrokes, you can\u2019t make it much shorter than that. Three keystrokes and you\u2019ve just started a sub process.\u201d\n\nThe next two suggestions I\u2019ll dedicate to goroutines. Goroutines are the signature feature of the language, our answer for first class concurrency. They are so easy to use, just put the word\n\nin front of the statement and you\u2019ve launched that function asynchronously. It\u2019s so simple, no threads, no stack sizes, no thread pool executors, no ID\u2019s, no tracking completion status.\n\nGoroutines are cheap. Because of the runtime\u2019s ability to multiplex goroutines onto a small pool of threads (which you don\u2019t have to manage), hundreds of thousands, millions of goroutines are easily accommodated. This opens up designs that would be not be practical under competing concurrency models like threads or evented callbacks.\n\nBut as cheap as goroutines are, they\u2019re not free. At a minimum there\u2019s a few kilobytes for their stack, which, when you\u2019re getting up into the 10^6 goroutines, does start to add up. This is not to say you shouldn\u2019t use millions of goroutines if that is what the design calls for, but when you do, it\u2019s critical that you keep track of them because 10^6 of anything can consume a non trivial amount of resources in aggregate.\n\nGoroutines are the key to resource ownership in Go. To be useful a goroutine has to do something, and that means it almost always holds reference to, or ownership of, a resource; a lock, a network connection, a buffer with data, the sending end of a channel. While that goroutine is alive, the lock is held, the network connection remains open, the buffer retained and the receivers of the channel will continue to wait for more data.\n\nThe simplest way to free those resources is to tie them to the lifetime of the goroutine\u2013when the goroutine exits, the resource has been freed. So while it\u2019s near trivial to start a goroutine, before you write those three letters, g o and a space, make sure you have an answer to these questions:\n\nIt is likely that in any serious Go program you write there will be concurrency involved. This raises the problem, many of the libraries and code that we write fall into this a one goroutine per connection, or worker pattern. How will you manage the lifetime of those goroutines?\n\nis a prime example. Shutting down the server owning the listening socket is relatively straight forward, but what about a goroutines spawned from that accepting socket?\n\ndoes provide a context object inside the request object which can be used to signal\u2013to code that is listening\u2013that the request should be canceled, thereby terminating the goroutine, however it is less clear how to know when all of these things have been done. It\u2019s one thing to call\n\n, its another to know that the cancellation has completed.\n\nThe point I want to make about\n\nis that its a counter example to good practice. Because each connection is handled by a goroutine spawned inside the\n\ntype, the program, living outside the\n\npackage, does not have an ability to control the goroutines spawned for the accepting socket.\n\nThis is an area of design that is still evolving, with efforts like go-kit\u2019s\n\nand the Go team\u2019s\n\nwhich provide a framework to execute, cancel and wait on functions run asynchronously.\n\nThe bigger design maxim here is for library writers, or anyone writing code that could be run asynchronously, leave the responsibility of starting to goroutine to your caller. Let the caller choose how they want to start, track, and wait on your functions execution.\n\nPerhaps you were hoping to read an article from me where I didn\u2019t rant about testing. Sadly, today is not that day.\n\nYour tests are the contract about what your software does and does not do. Unit tests at the package level should lock in the behaviour of the package\u2019s API. They describe, in code, what the package promises to do. If there is a unit test for each input permutation, you have defined the contract for what the code will do\n\n, not documentation.\n\nThis is a contract you can assert as simply as typing\n\n. At any stage, you can\n\nwith a high degree of confidence, that the behaviour people relied on before your change continues to function after your change.\n\nTests lock in api behaviour. Any change that adds, modifies or removes a public api must include changes to its tests.\n\nGo is a simple language, only 25 keywords. In some ways this makes the features that are built into the language stand out. Equally these are the features that the language sells itself on, lightweight concurrency, structural typing.\n\nI think all of us have experienced the confusion that comes from trying to use all of Go\u2019s features at once. Who was so excited to use channels that they used them as much as they could, as often as they could? Personally for me I found the result was hard to test, fragile, and ultimately overcomplicated. Am I alone?\n\nI had the same experience with goroutines, attempting to break the work into tiny units I created a hard to manage hurd of Goroutines and ultimately missed the observation that most of my goroutines were always blocked waiting for their predecessor\u2013\u2009the code was ultimately sequential and I had added a lot of complexity for little real world benefit. Who has experienced something like this?\n\nI had the same experience with embedding. Initially I mistook it for inheritance. Then later I recreated the fragile base class problem by composing complicated types, which already had several responsibilities, into more complicated mega types.\n\nThis is potentially the least actionable piece of advice, but one I think is important enough to mention. The advice is always the same, all things in moderation, and Go\u2019s features are no exception. If you can, don\u2019t reach for a goroutine, or a channel, or embed a struct, anonymous functions, going overboard with packages, interfaces for everything, instead prefer simpler approach rather than the clever approach.\n\nI want to close with one final item from PEP-20,\n\n\u201cReadability Counts.\u201d\n\nSo much has been said, about the importance of readability, not just in Go, but all programming languages. People like me who stand on stages advocating for Go use words like simplicity, readability, clarity, productivity, but ultimately they are all synonyms for one word\u2013\n\n.\n\nThe real goal is to write maintainable code. Code that can live on after the original author. Code that can exist not just as a point in time investment, but as a foundation for future value. It\u2019s not that readability doesn\u2019t matter, maintainability matters\n\n.\n\nGo is not a language that optimises for clever one liners. Go is not a language which optimises for the least number of lines in a program. We\u2019re not optimising for the size of the source code on disk, nor how long it takes to type the program into an editor. Rather, we want to optimise our code to be clear to the reader. Because its the reader who\u2019s going to have to maintain this code.\n\nIf you\u2019re writing a program for yourself, maybe it only has to run once, or you\u2019re the only person who\u2019ll ever see it, then do what ever works for you. But if this is a piece of software that more than one person will contribute to, or that will be used by people over a long enough time that requirements, features, or the environment it runs in may change, then your goal must be for your program to be maintainable. If software cannot be maintained, then it will be rewritten; and that could be the last time your company will invest in Go.\n\nCan the thing you worked hard to build be maintained after you\u2019re gone? What can you do today to make it easier for someone to maintain your code tomorrow?"}

In fact there is no goal - other than to use your skills and creativity to make someone's life a little bit better.\n\nSince quitting my job last year to do my own thing I've experienced a lot of ups and downs.

You can read the\n\nbut basically a honeycomb shaped kids' shoebox I saw at a farm gave me the inspiration I needed.\n\nThe idea was that the stickers could be arranged however you wanted in a hexagon grid, with stickers taking up either one, two, or three hexagons.\n\nOnce the designs were done, I happily sent them off to Stickermule for printing. But when the samples came back the stickers didn't snap together like they were supposed to:\n\nTheir customer support people were super patient with me over the course of our 80 emails back and forth.

I slogged through it and at length finished my new r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\nI sent it out to a couple of companies that looked fun to work for but my mind remained fixed on the Flexbox question. At work the next day I decided to cowboy up and get the form over with. The company had recently -\n\n- dropped IE9 support (enterprise amiright?) so I tackled it with Flexbox, scoring some more traffic/ad revenue for the css-tricks guys. After trying random, failing combinations of\n\n,\n\n, and\n\nI had had enough.\n\n\u2014 I said to myself \u2014\n\n.\n\nI dove head first into the\n\nspec. I read it all the way through - with a growing sense of dread that I had made a terrible life decision to become a UI dev. I might as well have read a manual on Thermodynamics for all I got out of it.\n\nMorale only mostly shattered, I headed over to codepen and started playing around with Flexbox. I experimented, tweaked, watched the changes as I made them. I wrote down any questions that came to mind while I tinkered. And gradually things started to\n\n. I became\n\nwith Flexbox. Most days I'd try to get my work done extra fast so I'd have some time to\n\nwith it, to learn even more.\n\nI went back and re-read the Flexbox spec and this time it made perfect sense. The craziest part is I found\n\n. I didn't realize it at the time but I had accidentally discovered a critical aspect to loving work.\n\nI started getting requests from coworkers to help them with Flexbox. So I shared the metaphors for understanding Flexbox concepts that I had come up for myself for remembering things:\n\nPicture you're holding a crossbow and aiming either North, East, South, or West. That's\n\n. These zombies (flex items) are coming from the south, so set your crossbow to\n\n.\n\nThe people I helped\n\nthis way of thinking about Flexbox. They convinced me to create a little tutorial on it. Flexbox Zombies v1 was born.\n\nIt started as a little prototoype. I made a simple text-based email sequence with some codepen exercises that looked like this:\n\nI launched the project and refreshed my email list frequently to see if anybody on the interwebs had signed up. Pretty much just my friends and people from work, but oh well I thought, it was fun to make.\n\nOne morning I checked and saw that three hundred people had signed up. I was shocked and ecstatic. It turned out some of my popular friends (\n\n,\n\n) had shared my creation on Twitter. I had been wanting to do my own thing for years, had even stockpiled a decent savings but was still\n\n\u2014 too afraid to make the leap. But this small win was all the excuse I needed. I put in my two weeks notice and set out on my own to create the full on\n\nMastery Game:\n\nI decided to keep this game free, with the hopes that people would love it and would want to support me by buying my next game. To date over 80,000 people have signed up and learned Flexbox with me.\n\nAfter shipping that I announced a preorder for my first paid game:\n\nwhich helps people internalize CSS Grid layout.\n\nTo my utter delight, hundreds of devs dropped their hard-earned cash monies on this new Mastery Game. Including engineers from Microsoft, Github, Google and Apple. I was completely floored. But what's awesome about all of this isn't\n\n\u2014 but the highly valuable principle I discovered along the way.\n\nBy facing down the Flexbox dragon I inadvertently stumbled onto a key principle of learning:\n\n. Learning through play is more fun, easier to get yourself to actually do, and much more effective.\n\nDon't\n\n. Not ever really mastering your craft is\n\n. But it's numbing. It's like never venturing out of a game's starting zone. No wonder you're bored out of your mind fighting level 1 sheep. That's all you're capable of handling to this point, but you were made for so much more.\n\nSo here's my advice: start\n\n. Face the difficulty head on. Commit to\n\nfrontend development. It\n\nbe hard. Head down this path and yes - there be dragons. But you'll slay them and it will feel amazing. And a few things will happen:\n\nI've designed\n\nspecifically for you. Because you're like me \u2014 you're not content to be mediocre in your craft. Devs like us have too much passion to settle or coast.\n\nIt's time to\n\nyour frontend coding skills. Leverage this\n\nprinciple with my Mastery Game. It will guide you, challenge you, reward you. It's the ideal environment for\n\nwith CSS Grid. One where you get to actually\n\n. By the time you complete the hundreds of levels, you\n\nbe a master of CSS Grid layout.\n\nMaster CSS Grid right from the start by playing this new mastery\n    game. You'll learn the ins and outs of Grids one fun level at a time,\n    while saving an adorable alien life form from certain destruction."}

It worked fine on my machine so I shipped it. The feeling of shipping was amazing. I even took my wife and kids to dinner to celebrate the big launch! That's when I got the first email from one of my brand new students:\n\nHey Dave this looks awesome but it really bogs down my laptop, I'd love for it to actually work!\n\nI felt bad that she had such an \"old machine\", made a mental note to do some perf testing later, and went back to my sticky finger quesadillas. My phone buzzed again:\n\nWow I love the artwork! Unfortunately that's all I get to enjoy because it completely destroys my machine. I can't even use my mouse it's so bad.\n\nYou know that sinking feeling of dread you haven't felt since getting busted for starting a chemical fire as a kid? Just me? Ok well, let's just say I wasn't in the mood for dessert. Over the course of the next few days I received a lot of emails and direct\n\nmessages from people who were loving the Mastery Game, so at least it worked for some people. But I was heartbroken about the many others. I decided to pause the creation of the remaining levels to figure out what was causing such a big problem in my app.\n\nIt just so happened that I had a hack weekend scheduled with some friends, which turned out to be perfect for focusing on this problem. I dug into it more and learned - to my disappointment - that it wasn't going to be an easy fix at all.\n\nIt turned out the problem was with the way I was (ab)using WebGL. I had designed the game so that for each zombie in the level there was a DOM element containing a canvas with its own 3D context (highlighted in blue outline in the following screenshots). Same for the hoodie character.\n\nNow as the user enters code into the LCD screen a few things happen. Targets appear - each painted in their own (2D) canvas:\n\nOnce the user gets the answer right, the Hoodie character shoots the zombies and they're swapped out with a\n\ncanvas/context for a death animation:\n\nSo far that makes\n\n3D contexts and\n\n2D contexts, oh my. But it gets even worse. Every time you change the\n\n, the hoodie character aims in the appropriate direction, getting swapped out for... you guessed it. Another 3D context. Before long your computer realizes that the browser is asking for waaaaay too many resources and requests for additional resources get denied. The browser then has to make do with what it's got. So it\n\nthe oldest WebGL contexts in order to free things up for the new ones. When this is about to happen you see this delightful message in the devtools:\n\nWell this is bad when you kinda sorta need the thing on the screen that's about to get dumped. Fortunately you can react to this event and recreate all your textures etc in that poor unloved WebGL context. But it's expensive and if you're recovering contexts over and over it eventually overwhelms the CPU and brings the computer to its knees.\n\nOnce I understood what was happening the solution was obvious: only use a single canvas/context. All I had to do was\n\nand\n\n! It only took the geniuses who build browsers eight years to get it right, how hard could it be?\n\nAfter a good cry I went on the hack weekend trip and brainstormed some ideas with my brilliant/thoughtful friend\n\n. We prototyped a super interesting idea:\n\n. We were pleased to discover that this would do the trick quite nicely. Here's how it works:\n\nA component renders a regular, empty\n\nwhich gets controlled by regular CSS flexbox:\n\nWhen the component is mounted it\n\n(size & position) and draws its WebGL textures (the zombie/hoodie graphics) into the shared canvas at exactly the right spot!\n\nHide the divs' borders and BOOM!\n\n.\n\nThe app runs\n\nbetter now. Chrome takes about 11% CPU now as opposed to ~30% before. Memory usage is ~5MB lower going from level to level. The animations are also smoother. There is probably even more optimization I could do later. But hey, at least now flexbox zombies is safe to use on an airplane. Time to finish writing the rest of the story's chapters.\n\nIn hindsight it seems obvious that I was using WebGL/canvas wrong. But I also think that had I tried to something clever like this the first time around it would have just been a distraction from building out my Mastery Game idea, and would have taken a lot longer to ship. I'm a believer in\n\n.\n\nSolving the performance problems for\n\nwho were pumped to use something I had made was incredibly motivating. If I still hadn't shipped it I would still have been wondering if people even cared about what I was making, which would have made it really hard to sink another week into a rewrite of the core mechanics.\n\nNo matter how smart you are, you need good friends. People who aren't so close to the problems you're trying to solve and can therefore see them with fresh perspective. People who care enough to tell you when your baby is ugly, and then put in the time and energy to help you make it awesome.\n\nAm I sorry I shipped before it was perfect? Not one bit. A ton of people still loved it, and who knows? Maybe some devs were able to use this to prove to their bosses that they needed a new laptop :) It's still not perfect, which grates on a perfectionist like me. But I'm training myself to be more OK with the mindset that\n\n.\n\nOh and yeah, go easy on the WebGL :)\n\nFlexbox is incredibly powerful. But it's also crazy hard to master. So\n    we all end up depending on a cheat sheet and guessing in the dev\n    tools. Enough of that! Time to master it once and for all, in a way\n    that actually sticks, so you can build any layout you can imagine with\n    flexbox."}
{"url": "https://mastery.games/post/learn-to-draw/", "origin": "https://gedd.ski/", "title": "Learn to Draw", "content": "Programming can be fun and rewarding work, especially when what we're creating challenges us. But any difficult undertaking inevitably means hitting roadblocks. Getting stumped. Having no idea how to overcome the latest problem or how to proceed. Coding is about solving problems, one after another. One of the most valuable tools you can add to your problem-solving aresenal is the ability to draw.\n\nWhat does drawing have to do with solving problems? I'm taking a drawing course from renowned illustrator\n\nwhere he asks students this simple question:\n\nTo which he answers:\n\nDrawing is seeing. When you're seeing, you're observing. And when you're observing, you're asking questions. The right questions.\n\nThe process of drawing is the process of asking yourself questions. Usually when we get stuck on a problem we ask ourselves:\n\nBut in drawing, you throw out what you know and ask yourself the more helpful question:\n\nLearning to draw helps us see past our assumptions. Explanations our brains would have classified as \"not possible\" become on the table.\n\nOne time I was working on adding a new card size to my project at work. Because I'm\n\nat estimates, I thought it would take only a few minutes. I found where the other card sizes appeared to be defined, and added mine. I closed the ticket and went to lunch. I came back to the app completely busted in the dev environment. After a\n\nand bit of shame, I sat down to figure out what went wrong.\n\nAs it turned out, the card sizing feature was a fragile and complex beast summoned from the depths of hell. I tackled it the only way I knew how. I grabbed an 11x17 sheet of paper from the office supply closet and started digging through the code. As I discovered a useful clue, I'd sketch it out on my paper. A couple of hours later I had a diagram drawn that accurately illustrated how the feature worked. Once I understood it, changing it was a snap.\n\nAnother time I was working on lining up the user-controlled terrain items in\n\n. My boxes were slightly off and I didn't know why. So I did what has become a favorite technique of mine: I snapped a picture of my Mac's screen with my iPad's camera, and opened up the photo in a drawing app on the iPad.\n\nThat let me draw right on top of my UI. I asked myself what behavior I was\n\n, and what I\n\nit to be doing. With that clarity I was able to think through what was not quite right and quickly implement a solution.\n\nYou can't solve a problem you can't see clearly. In my experience the best way to see something clearly is to draw it out.\n\nDrawing helps you see not only\n\nproblems but\n\nones as well.\n\nPrototyping is nothing more than getting an idea out of your head so that it can answer a specific question. Drawing is the fastest form of prototyping and can answer most questions.\n\nIn my game I wanted little interceptor ships to fly out of the space ship and arrive at specific locations, based on the user's CSS Grid template & gaps. Before typing a single character of code, I drew this out:\n\nDrawing this helped me think through how I would build it: each ship would have three coordinates they would travel to:\n\nThen as I wrote and stepped through the code, I could refer often to a specific interceptor in my drawing and quickly see whether I was building it correctly.\n\nEven though this made me realize I'd forgetten pretty much everything from college trig class, I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. Here's the result in slow motion so you can see how the interceptors follow the paths:\n\nThis simple drawing didn't take long at all to think through and create. It answered my question, then it guided what I ultimately coded. I didn't need mocks or a requirements doc. Just the bit of seeing and thinking that comes whenever you draw.\n\nHere's another example of a prototype drawing: the chat panel UI I show how to build in\n\n.\n\nStart leveraging the power of drawing to solve problems. Don't fret if you don't currently consider yourself a \"visual thinker\" - that's something that will come as you train yourself to think visually by drawing.\n\nGetting good at drawing will really pay off in the long run, definitely something to add to your regular\n\n. Here's what I recommend for getting started:\n\nGo through the lessons on\n\n. They're completely free and start with the very basics. I'm going through these right now myself and have already seen an improvement in my skills.\n\nYou don't\n\nany digital tools for this but I've found the iPad/Apple Pencil to be compeletely awesome for this. I prefer this setup over something like a Wacom tablet, because you can take it with you on a walk or to the park\n\n. The best iOS app I've found so far is\n\nbecause of its infinite canvas. I also like\n\nfor freestyle drawing/painting.\n\nThe next time you find yourself solving a problem while coding - try drawing it!\n\nFlexbox is incredibly powerful. But it's also crazy hard to master. So\n    we all end up depending on a cheat sheet and guessing in the dev\n    tools. Enough of that! Time to master it once and for all, in a way\n    that actually sticks, so you can build any layout you can imagine with\n    flexbox."}

That guy who's always talking about starting his own business but who spends most of his free time playing Starcraft.\n\nOur actions always reveal our real values.\n\n\u2014 Derek Sivers\n\nIf this rings a bell and\n\n, it's possible that you don't actually\n\nto do your own thing. And that's OK! Absolutely nothing wrong with working with cool people at a 9 to 5.\n\nBut if you\n\nwant it, then there's really only one obstacle in your way:\n\n.\n\nI'm speaking from experience on this one. As soon as I decided to get real about my goal to do my own thing, my brain helpfully provided a billion reasons why I shouldn't. Here are just a few that may sound familiar to you:\n\nYou wonder how you'll pay the bills and feed yourself and your family. If you're being honest though you know you'd never actually let that happen and as developer you could pretty easily get\n\nkind of job. But you\n\nit would be a waste to save up soooo much cash just to bootstrap something that doesn't pan out. And you\n\nthat future disappointment of failing at this dream you worked so hard just to get the opportunity to take a shot at!\n\nNote: I don't recommend quitting your day job until you're either making enough on the side already to cover all your expenses or you've saved up a full year's runway. More on that in a future post.\n\n\"But what if my idea just plain sucks?\" Well it just might. But how will you ever know if you don't ship it? An amazing idea that never ships is more tragic than a classic French film. Buying into this fear is choosing to experience failure in advance.\n\nThis is a big one. Gary Vaynerchuck (one of my heroes) makes the case that most of the time our primary fear is to\n\n. The reality is they probably believe in you a lot more than you do! After watching Gary's video I asked my wife Melissa if she would be supportive of me doing my own thing even if I crashed and burned. Her response was gold to me: \"Oh my gosh honey I just want you to be happy and I've never doubted you for a second\". Somehow I had let my fear convince me that failure at entrepreneurship would be failure at marriage, which raised the stakes to unreasonable levels.\n\nPeople often point out \"hey, the worst that could happen is you get another day job!\". And while you agree with that assesment, the thought of failure still stings. You worry that people will somehow think lesser of you if you botch it.\n\n\"So many people are making amazing things already! How can I compete with them?\" Think about just one of the successful competitors in your space. Did the market have just one slot left before filling up and they took it? This is just that old fear again telling you you're not as good, not as smart, not as creative. Thanks a bunch, fear.\n\nOne of the saddest conversations I ever had was when I told a person about my upcoming adventure and at first he was smiling, reminiscing about a time ten years ago when he was about to try something similar. But his countenance fell as he recounted how he had decided to play it safe and stay at his \"miserable job\". He then sighed and repeated to me the words of his shoulder-dwelling fear angel: \"Anyway, I'm too old for that now\".\n\nIsn't it funny how badly we cling to things once we think we're about to give them up? Even things we\n\n. If I know I'm going to start a diet tomorrow suddenly those stale cheetos in the pantry look\n\n. The thought of quitting a decent, high paying job brings out this fear: \"will I ever have something this good again?\". It's really the same fear as the age one: \"you've reached your peak, it's only downhill from here.\" It can be hard to give up the easy, comfortable life.\n\nAll our reasons not to try really just boil down to fear. The nice thing about fear is you're already fully equiped to obliterate it. You just need to know how.\n\nHere's the formula I used for overcoming all of these fears and making the leap to do my own thing:\n\nThe first step is to acknowledge the fear. Don't pretend it doesn't exist or try to downplay it. It's real and it's crippling you like a three-year-old clinging to your leg as you try to walk. It helps to\n\n. To see it on a piece of paper and be like \"yep, that's what I'm worried about\". As a super personal example, this one's been my biggest fear:\n\nI'm afraid I won't make enough money to keep doing what I love.\n\nOnce you write down the fear, it helps to\n\n. I call this particular one the good old\n\n. Once something has a name/label it becomes easier to recognize when you're being influenced by it. Instead of a vague cloud of worry keeping you from feeling excited you can pinpoint it and say \"oh yeah, I'm feeling the cash anxiety right now\".\n\nNaming your fear/emotion is one of the most useful aspects of mindfulness:\n\nThere is a simple technique for self-regulation called \u201caffect labeling,\u201d which simply means labeling feelings with words. When you label an emotion you are experiencing (for example, \u201cI feel anger\u201d), it somehow helps you manage that emotion.\n\n\u2014 Chade-Meng Tan, Search Inside Yourself\n\nI wonder if Chade-Meng Tan realized how\n\nit is that he named the act of naming things. In any case, \"affect labeling\" is powerful and gives you a solid pin to spear right into the center of your fear.\n\nOnce you've clearly identified the fear and given it a name, the next step is to imagine a situation where that fear is completely nonexistent. A scenario in which it would be downright silly for that fear to try its tricks on you. For example if you're worried about having a good enough idea, imagine a scenario where you're getting\n\nfrom actual paying customers raving about how your product/idea improves their lives. If you're worried about money imagine yourself making 30k a month doing what you love. Don't use that S.M.A.R.T. goal garbage - right now you want to\n\n.\n\nYou must set targets that are 10 times what you think you want and then do 10 times what you think it will take to accomplish those targets. Massive thoughts must be followed by massive actions.\n\n\u2014 Grant Cardone, The 10X Rule\n\nThis ideal scenario - as lofty and crazy as it might sound to your friends when you tell them - is a place where your fear simply can't exist. This scenario is now your new\n\n. Write it down right next to the fear. Associate it in your mind with the fear, so that any time you feel the fear you are immediately reminded of the Guiding Star you're working towards.\n\nOnce you've named your fear and know what the exact opposite - your guiding star - looks like, it's time to start sailing towards it. This is the most important step.\n\n. And worrying isn't going to help - it just feeds your fear. Same with waiting. The only way through the fear is to take action towards that guiding star. You won't get there overnight. Or in a month and probably not even in a year. When you arrive doesn't really matter so don't try to\n\n. Instead, set little goals that lead you one at a time towards the gigantic goal. You'll get to celebrate tiny wins along the way.\n\nMy main Guiding Star right now is to build up my audience of UI devs. I'm doing it by helping UI nerds like myself master UI tech, so they can build amazing stuff and land the best jobs. With a massive goal of 10,000 devs taped to my wall I decided I was done standing on the edge of the cliff with my wing suit strapped to my back. I took deep breath and jumped! I quit my job and created\n\n- a free Mastery Game where you shoot zombies with a crossbow controlled by flexbox. I had probably been watching too much Walking Dead when I came up with the idea. Anyway, even though my guiding star is 10,000 students my first little goal was just 100. I was absolutely\n\nwhen I hit it! So I set a new little goal of 500 students. My kids cheered and celebrated with me when I reached it (they really have no idea what it means but they like the zombies). So on to 1,000. Then 2,000. Then 5,000. Then 7,000. I've recently passed 18,000 and am going strong. Hitting these smaller goals along the way to my guiding star is making all the difference.\n\nDon't feel like you need to map out every little goal in between where you're at now and where you want to end up. You only need to come up with the one next small goal that moves you a little closer to your Guiding Star. Each time you reach a little goal you'll have a better idea what your next one should be.\n\nFollowing these steps has helped me overcome a ton of fears and finally take my shot at doing my own thing. If you're wanting to do the same I hope this helps, and I'd love to hear your story. My\n\ndirect messages are always open.\n\nFirst\n\nwhether you really want to do your own thing. If you do, then write down a\n\n/reasons why you're not already doing it or making progress towards it. Give each fear a\n\n. For your biggest fear write down and tape your wall a new\n\n- a gigantic goal that would obliterate that fear. Set your first\n\nthat moves you one step closer to that destination and\n\non it\n\n."}
{"url": "https://mastery.games/post/routine-success/", "origin": "https://gedd.ski/", "title": "Routine Success", "content": "This time of year can bring a lot of hope and encouragement, with fresh resolutions and clear ambitions. But it can also bring discouragement when you realize that you felt this same way last year but that excitement didn't translate into lasting change or meaningful results. Your resolutions fizzled out, again.\n\nI've been thinking a lot about what worked for me in 2017, and what didn't. I basically had two goals: start my own business and get in shape. I made incredible progress on the entrepreneur life: I quit my job, created Mastery Games for\n\nand for\n\n, wrote tons of\n\n, and grew my audience to over 11,000 UI devs. But I didn't do jack for my health. I'm still 30lbs overweight and my sleep schedule is terrible.\n\nWhat was the difference between my successful goal and my failure? I had them both hung up on my wall where I'd be reminded of them daily. They were equally high priority in my mind. What made me crush one goal and neglect the other?\n\nI realize now that there was only one small but important difference: I had\n\nfor accomplishing my entrepreneur goal. I had set aside time\n\nto work towards it. My \"get healthy\" goal remained wishful thinking and a source of constant guilt. But the biz stuff really took off as I applied constant, scheduled effort in the form of a daily routine.\n\nMy takeaway from this is that\n\n. Things worth doing take work, a lot of it. The best way to make sure you're giving your goals the steady effort they require is to design a routine around them.\n\nI've also learned that routines need to be anchored to a specific goal in order to carry enough meaning. A routine on its own is a rather empty thing, and can be very difficult to stick to if its not tied to an outcome you truly want. I've written about the importance of having a\n\nin\n\n. Pick a huge goal that will make a real difference in your life when you achieve it. For me this year I have two guiding stars: lose 30lbs and earn more income than I did at my \"real job\". These guiding stars give me context, meaning, and direction. I've designed a custom daily routine for sailing full mast towards them.\n\nSean Covey in\n\nmakes a distinction between \"lag measures\" and \"lead measures\". Lag measures are\n\n, outcomes/rewards that come to us after we put in the hard work. For example losing weight, hitting a savings target, or mastering a new skill. Lag measures are important to set our sights on. They're the guiding stars we sail towards. \"I'm going to become an amazing frontend developer - one who can build anything I can imagine\" is a perfect lag measure/goal. To get there though you need lead measures.\n\nA lead measure is something that is indicative of the lag measure. An action that if done consistently will lead to the end result you're after. Saving \\$300 per paycheck\n\nto hitting savings goals. Going to the gym every weekday\n\nto getting in shape.\n\nto skilled proficiency. You have direct control over lead measures. The key is to pick the right lead measures for your goal and then build them into your routine.\n\nI used to make goals like \"develop a drawing habit\". Not anymore. Habits are too vague and unpredictable. Does it take 60 days to make a habit? Six months? What does it take to sustain a habit? Who knows. Habits are more of an outcome that may or may not kick in at some point and make things easier. Not something you should bank on or even worry about now. A routine however is directly in your control. You can start a new routine tonight. You can choose to do your routine every single day. Eventually the habit fairy will come along and make doing your routine feel natural and require very little effort. In the meantime though, just go rock your routine.\n\nMy new routine starts at 10:00PM every night (a successful morning routine starts the night before). When 10PM rolls around I feel very little desire to shut my brain/computer down and start getting ready for bed. I remind myself that this is what it takes to get healthy and self-reliant, but going to brush my teeth sounds so lame in the moment compared to playing Overwatch. But as soon as I force myself to go do that first item on the routine, the\n\nand the rest of the routine is a piece of cake. Getting started is the hardest part. Because of this phenomenon I've changed my routine and no joke made petting my dog Sam the very first item in my nightly routine. Pick something easy and enjoyable as your first item to jumpstart your routine, and breeze past the hardest part of simply getting started.\n\nPick one or two guiding stars (no more). Something you\n\nwant to make happen this year. Something that would make a massive and awesome difference for you. Next decide on a couple of lead measures - actions that if done consistently will lead you to the outcome you want. Now build those actions into a daily routine. Stick to your routine - feel free to adjust/tweak it as you learn.

Every day I looked forward to my lunch break. I'd clock out, hop on my little Vespa scooter, and zoom home to my apartment. I'd wolf down a quick sandwich and log in to World of Warcraft.\n\n50 minutes left \u2014 had to make it count. Accept new quest. Equip new bow. Ready to take on the world, my pet bear Chewy and I set out to kill those 10 rats that had been tormenting the poor blacksmith.\n\nAfter making short work of the vermin, we returned to town to claim our reward. Gratitude, 20 coins and some decent new pants \u2014 not too shabby. But then the real reward came. A loud ding sound, a flash of light, and a dozen \"grats\" messages from the local chat.\n\nI had leveled up.\n\nI zipped back to work with 6 minutes left and a smile on my face.\n\nThose clever psychologists at Blizzard knew how to make addicting games by mimicking the real-world reward systems. When you level up in Warcraft you experience a huge boost of endorphins. Your character's base stats are all increased: more life, more damage, more mana. You can carry better weapons and equip stronger armor. You're ready to take on even bigger challenges.\n\nThere is nothing quite like that feeling of progress.\n\nIt takes more time and effort in real life, but when you put in the work towards mastering a new skill, you are transformed. Your brain's synapses are literally rewired for the accomplishment of that task in the future. The experience you gain\n\nyou\u2014 for the better.\n\nI used to struggle with CSS. I'd have to interrupt my work and look things up all the time. I got really tired of that crap and finally tackled the beast. It took the reading (and re-reading) of specs, studying blog posts/examples, and most of all\n\nwith the tech\u2014\u00a0building a\n\nof little projects myself. And I gradually leveled up. Now I feel so comfortable with CSS I don't even think about it while I work. I'm able to focus on the thing I'm building rather than the tools I use, and it feels incredible.\n\nI've designed my games (\n\nand\n\n) to help others attain this level of CSS mastery in the most fun way possible.\n\nOn the other hand, I currently feel like a n00b at the new thing I'm learning: TypeScript. I hit the limits of my skills with it daily. Feeling like a beginner again \u2014 getting stuck and frustrated \u2014 is a good sign! It means you're learning. The trick is to use every single one of these moments as an opportunity to\n\n. Don't just google the answer and paste it in, that won't\n\nyou one bit. Study the thing that stumped you. Take the time to understand\n\nthe solution works. Sure, getting unstuck is your goal. But try to transform yourself into the person who gets\n\nunstuck. Over time you'll hit fewer and fewer snags as your mastery over the skill develops.\n\nJust like in video games, this leveling up brings with it many new possibilities. For starters you can learn additional things that would have previously been over your head. You become able to build more advanced, complex and delightful creations. Your ability to appreciate and learn from the fine work of others is refined. Your creativity centers have more raw materials to work with, expanding your imagination and ability to generate original ideas. And of course, you can earn more money because you are more skilled at your craft. But as a wise man once said\n\n.\n\nNothing generates motivation like the pursuit (and use) of mastery. It's incredibly rewarding to witness your own transformation as you put in the effort. No dings sound, no light rays beam all around you, but you can feel yourself leveling up. Your inner drive getting replenished. Making progress on the road to mastery adds logs to the flame of your\n\n.\n\nPeople often think it goes the other way around.\n\n. But then they wonder why they can't seem to stick to a plan long enough to get really good. Don't wait around for motivation to strike (it won't). Generate it yourself by setting out on the path of mastery.\n\nIn Dan Pink's excellent book\n\nhe lists the three key ingredients of genuine motivation: autonomy, mastery, and purpose.\n\nMastery is a mindset: It requires the capacity to see your abilities not as finite, but as infinitely improvable. Mastery is a pain: It demands effort, grit, and deliberate practice.\n\n\u2014 Dan Pink\n\nYou're never going to feel motivated on a project where you're not getting good at something that matters to you. Motivation only flows naturally when:\n\nMastery is a key ingredient of motivation, and the one over which you have the most control.\n\nThe happiness of a man in this life does not consist in the absence but in the mastery of his passions.\n\n\u2014 Alfred Lord Tennyson\n\nAt first it takes hard work, pure and simple. But as you progress you begin to enjoy the skill you've worked hard to master. As your motivation shifts from extrinsic to intrinsic, the work itself becomes a reward.\n\nWhen you're first learning to draw, it takes steady discipline and constant practice. But eventually drawing becomes a resource for you, something you do for the simple enjoyment of it. I'll write more about this\n\nmotivation in a future post.\n\nOne of my favorite audiobooks of all time is\n\nby Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. His life's study was to observe and figure out what makes people happy. He concluded that it isn't their leisure time, but rather their time spent in the state of flow that gives people the most joy and fulfillment.\n\nContrary to what we usually believe, moments like these, the best moments in our lives, are not the passive, receptive, relaxing times\u2014although such experiences can also be enjoyable, if we have worked hard to attain them. The best moments usually occur when a person's body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult or worthwhile. Optimal experience is thus something that we make happen.\n\nCsikszentmihalyi discovered that happiness comes from the process of intentionally focusing everything you've got on one thing at a time. On narrowing in and deliberately progressing along the path of mastery.\n\nAre you ready to commit yourself to the path of mastery? To finally become amazing at the skills your heart is drawn to? Transformation, opportunities, motivation and happiness will be your loot if you're willing to put in the work.\n\nPick up\n\nand I'll guide you to master CSS Grid \u2014 the best thing to ever happen to CSS and the single most important skill a modern web dev needs to master.\n\nMaster CSS Grid right from the start by playing this new mastery\n    game.

{"url": "https://mastery.games/post/solve-it-once/", "origin": "https://gedd.ski/", "title": "Solve It Once", "content": "I have an awesome little Manchester Terrier named Sam. She's the best dog a guy could ask for. Good with the kids, isn't yappy or annoying like most small dogs, loves to play and keeps my knees warm during shows. But Sam has one major downside: like most Terriers, she loves to\n\n.\n\nNeighborhood kids come over?\n\nshe's out the door and enjoying her adventure before the first cuss word can form in my mind. Whenever I need to go check the mail I'll carefully scan the living room, making sure the beast is nowhere in sight. But as soon as I open that front door just three inches, she appears out of nowhere and dashes through.\n\nI've put up with my little escapist for\n\n. FIVE YEARS. During which I made several half-hearted attempts at solving the problem. More walks, dog training, neighbor training, signs, etc. Nothing worked and I'd just go back to dealing with it. This last year since working from home it got especially annoying. I'd be working in my office, finally in that precious\n\nwhen all of a sudden from out my window I hear a distant\n\nFlow shattered, I'd grumble and retrieve my dog. It finally broke me - I\n\nto fix the Sam problem.\n\nI set my mind to solving this blasted problem once and for all, and there was nothing in the world that could stop me. I brainstormed all sorts of ideas, the majority of which were legal and humane. I bought one of those electric shock collars but couldn't bring myself to using it on her. I tried a non-hurty sonar one that supposedly produces a dog-repelling sound at close proximity - talk about a scam. I even entertained the idea of inventing some kind of dog-catching robot.\n\nFinally I realized that if my brain couldn't defeat my pup, perhaps my opposable thumbs could. I devised a contraption in the doorway that would be easy enough for a human to step over, but too hard for Sam to get through or over. With a wicked laugh I walked through the isles of Home Depot and found what I needed. Sam eyed me curiously - I let her watch - as I installed the end of her freedom: eleven bungee cords strung tight between rings drilled into the wood frame.\n\nI consider this one of my life's greatest achievements. I never have to worry again about my best little friend getting hit by a car. And I'm writing this article right now in a wonderful state of uninterrupted flow.\n\nThis really got me thinking - why do we put up endlessly with unsolved problems? Things that cause us a lot of pain and frustration? Especially as developers, we put up with a ton of problems of our own making. Dog-slow webpack builds. Terrible home-grown abstractions. CSS that produces Jira bug tickets faster than you can squash them. Rotten areas of the codebase that use three different JS frameworks because nobody dares touch that crap. These snags cost us every time they're tripped over. New features take exponentially longer to release. Existing features get no love for the\n\nthey need.\n\nBut instead of eliminating problems once and for all, we let them fester. We let them\n\nour productivity. We label them\n\nand\n\nto solve them, knowing full well that decision makers have no idea what we're talking about. Because getting shot down by management kinda feels like\n\n. It's a quick way to feel proactive without having to tackle the hard problems -  plus now we can blame someone else for our situation. Victim mode FTW!\n\nNo joke - I worked at a place once that\n\nthe phrase \"Technical Debt\". Developers weren't allowed to say it. Execs were tired of hearing about it and just wanted people to solve their own problems.\n\nWe sometimes do the same thing with our dev skills. Weak skills come with a steep tax. Skilled UI devs don't settle for struggling endlessly with CSS. They master it. They don't have to stop what they're doing and look up Flexbox or Grid all the time. The good news is a weak skill is just another problem to be solved. Mastering the fundamentals of your craft pays off huge in the long run. This is why I created\n\nand\n\n- so devs can solve their frontent layout problems once and for all. It's been awesome watching my students master this stuff and build amazing things on their own.\n\nEarly computer scientist\n\ncame up with a rule he called\n\n(ZOI). The idea is that for frequency of occurrence there are only three categories:\n\nThis zero, one, or many rule has had a huge impact in our industry. We see it in foreign keys in database design. It's been a fundamental in UX design ever since Alan Cooper's classic\n\n. It's also a fantastic rule for knowing when to solve problems - both in your life and in your code.\n\nDon't worry about it yet. Sometimes us devs get overwhelmed thinking we have to learn every bit of tech out there, when in reality most of it exists to solve problems we don't currently have. You can be an expert UI developer by only focusing on mastering the fundamentals and\n\n.\n\nMake a note, but don't sic your mind on coming up with a solution. Many problems are one-time events that won't bite you again. (dog references intended)\n\nAs soon as a problem gets encountered twice (twice by you, or twice by two different people in your team/family) then you're in\n\nterritory. If it can happen twice, it can happen a thousand times. This is the right time to solve it good and solve it once.\n\nWhen you set out to solve a problem, the biggest temptation is to do a\n\n. Something that mitigates the pain a little. You know you've fallen prey to this \"band-aid\" mindset if you hear yourself saying things like\n\nor\n\nor\n\n. Temporary fixes just aren't worth it. How many times have you encountered a\n\nin a project from someone who doesn't even work there anymore? Their temporary fix is now one more thing you have to understand to actually fix the core problem.\n\nHere's a better way to work:\n\n. Like, actually solve it. So that the problem has no chance of wasting another engineer's afternoon ever again. You can get all fancy if you want - keeping a spreadsheet of every occurrence of every problem. But it's easy enough to just say \"hey team, the wonky dropdown component took me four hours to debug, anyone else run into this?\" If so - it's fixin' time and you're up! If you delay the task to the dusty backlog you'll never get around to it. Solve it now while it's fresh on your mind. Solve it good so nobody has to trip over it or even think about it ever again.\n\nImagine how productive your life and project would be if problems were fixed as they came up, never allowed to impact more than twice?\n\nThink about an unsolved problem - your Sam - that you've been dealing with forever. Stop reading this right now and go take care of it.\n\nIn case you're wondering from the illustrations, Sam does indeed look more like a bat than a dog. Now that I've solved the escaping problem she's a happy, safe bat-dog.\n\nMaster CSS Grid right from the start by playing this new mastery\n    game.

Even in a warm office, even when wearing a hoodie. Cold hands makes writing code difficult - your fingers get stiff, typing slows down, and you have a constant distraction while you're trying to work.\n\nIn the spirit of\n\n, I set out to find a solution to this annoying problem.\n\nI tried the obvious solution first: gloves! After trying five pairs I came to the conclusion that you can't type (fast) with gloves, no matter what their marketing sites say. The fingerless kind were the closest, but then you still got ten cold digits.\n\nThese things are pretty much only good if they're inside of a glove or sock. Otherwise they're too weak and ineffective.\n\nI tried rechargeable electric warmers like this lulu bob thingy.\n\nAs well as a few other contraptions that had good reviews on Amazon. The problem with all of them is they only heat the small inside part of your hand, while the outside and your fingers still freeze. Also the heat it gives you doesn't last so as soon as you let go and start to type, the cold returns fast.\n\nI rigged up a heating pad like a hot pocket around my keyboard & mouse. But the blasted thing kept giving me small electrocutions. It also made my mouse too hard to use.\n\nThese work OK but it's hard to aim them in a way that gets your whole hands. Also the heat is pushed by air and it can make your hands feel even colder if you're not positioned close enough. Overall they're a hassle. I tripped a few breakers at Domo giving them a shot though :)\n\nI really like these\n\n. They keep their heat for a good while and release a bit of moisture which seems to helps the heat penetrate deeper. I used this for a long time but got tired of having to microwave it every hour and a half or so. I still use it for cold feet every now and then.\n\nOne day I was lobstering up in my hot tub (don't judge me, I've wanted a hot tub since I was a kid) thinking about the cold hands problem. I pondered how effective water is at heating the body. I did some research as to why that is. Here's a good\n\nif you're interested.\n\nThere are many factors but the main ones are:\n\nOk so a water-based solution is what I wanted. Maybe I could fill up some ziploc bags with hot water?\n\nI tried that and it kind of worked but was a bit sketch and very time consuming. I was also worried about damaging\n\n. Then I remembered the sous vide machine I saw at my Ma and Pa's house. It's a little device meant for cooking meals using hot water.\n\nI snagged\n\n, plugged it in under my desk, set it to 106 fahrenheit and gave my cold hands a plunge.\n\nI'd found it. I'd found\n\nsolution.\n\nThis thing works amazingly well. It's like a mini hot tub just for your hands! You can set it to your exact perfect temperature and it holds it there all day. I've dialed mine in to 110 fahrenheit and I love using it.\n\nA good rhythm I've found is to work one\n\nsession (30 minutes for me) then soak the hands for about a minute. My hands heat deeply \u2014 to the bone it feels like \u2014 and stay warm all through the next coding session.\n\nSome tips if you try this out:\n\nPeople who work remote will probably love this. I would have used it at my open office jobs too had I thought of it back then. But if it's too awkward for you just go with the corn bag approach, that's a close second.\n\nNow you know how to keep them money makers nice 'n toasty. Happy coding!\n\nFlexbox is incredibly powerful. But it's also crazy hard to master. So\n    we all end up depending on a cheat sheet and guessing in the dev\n    tools. Enough of that! Time to master it once and for all, in a way\n    that actually sticks, so you can build any layout you can imagine with\n    flexbox."}

We take any opportunity to get together for this battle of wits. There's nothing sweeter than that smug feeling of outsmarting your buddy with a cleverly-executed strategy.\n\nThe pandemic has made it hard to always get together. But my friend\n\nwas determined to not let a meager world-ending plague interfere with our shared passion! He put his incredible design skills to work and re-created The Duke in the popular design tool\n\n\u2014the same tool I used to create my\n\n. Figma is especially good for board gaming with its excellent multi-player functionality.\n\nHi I\u2019m Adam and I\u2019ll explain how I got started designing the Duke board game in Figma. The Duke is like Chess in a lot of ways. Two players face off on opposite sides of the board, trying to capture a key piece: the Duke.\n\nThe first questions I had to answer to make sure this game didn\u2019t feel like some shanty A piece of garbage were:\n\nThe answers to both ended up being a bit obvious but cool. I made two pages, one for each player. I then created a master Board component for each player. Then I put an instance of it on the opponent\u2019s page, rotated at 180\u00ba. I also locked that instance so that it showed up but was not interactive. With that setup White can take an action on their Board/page and the locked/rotated instance on Black\u2019s page will reflect that action.\n\nFor example here is what the White player sees:\n\nAnd here's the same game from the perspective of the Black player:\n\nThis mirroring trick makes it feel like your opponent is sitting right across from you!\n\nThe Duke is different from Chess in that you only start with three pieces. On your turn you can either move an existing piece, or draw a new piece randomly from your bag. Each piece has specific available movement options printed on the front. However, after you move you have to flip the moved piece revealing totally different movement mechanics. We needed a way to quickly switch between sides, as well as obscure the piece before it\u2019s drawn. Figma\u2019s\n\nwere perfect for the job. I created three variants for each piece:\n\n,\n\nand\n\n.\n\nNow to draw a new piece you simply selected a\n\npiece in your bag and switched it to the\n\nvariant. After moving a piece you toggled the\n\nor\n\nvariant.\n\nFrom here we got to playing! And it was honestly really quite good. I however am blessed to be a designer with three best friends who are killer developers (\n\n,\n\nand\n\n). So naturally as we played together in Figma they saw the potential to take things to the next level.\n\nI\u2019ll hand off to Dave to explain how he took the Duke to swanky town.\n\nThere were several things we had to do by hand that just felt dinky. Every time you moved or captured an opponent's piece you had to fiddle around with Figma pages and layers. Ewwww! Shuffling the bag manually was especially painful.\n\nWhile thinking about ways to improve the Figma board gaming experience, we remembered that Figma now supports custom\n\nincluding\n\n.\n\nYou can even write the UI for your plugin in modern HTML/CSS. This makes\n\neven\n\nuseful if you can believe it. Figma also comes with the\n\nso you can debug your scripts and inspect your layouts.\n\nIn between games you had to do these steps manually:\n\nWhy do things like this yourself when code can do it for you?!\n\nTo automate the setup I assigned each piece a unique\n\n\u2014similar to an HTML\n\n\u2014so the pieces could be found and controlled with the Figma\n\n. I tried querying the pieces by layer name at first, but it was\n\ntoo slow in a document like this with lots of layers.\n\nOnce your code has a reference to a piece you can move it wherever you want:\n\nOr control which variant to show:\n\nNow that I knew how to control the game pieces with code, writing a game setup script was a piece of cake. The game reset script makes pieces go back in the bag, the bag gets a proper\n\n, and everything's ready for the next game!\n\nThe Duke is all about moving your pieces around and capturing your opponent's. These were manual processes with several steps. So I made a\n\n, which generates a new red Figma layer over each enemy piece. Then you can select which piece you want to capture, and the plugin code takes care of it!\n\nBoard gaming is the best and has really helped get me through this rough pandemic. I'll share this Figma document and plugin as soon as I get permission from The Duke publisher.\n\nFigma is an\n\ndesign and collaboration tool\u2014perfect for playing remotely with friends or prototyping your own board games.\n\nKnowing how to code is a superpower. It feels like wielding powerful magic, and breathes life into all your other hobbies and passions.

He was right, and what he said has stuck with me to this day.\n\nThe tools you use help you create more and better things than you could have on your own. Your tools empower you. They deserve your fierce loyalty... right up until the second you find something\n\n!\n\nIn that spirit, here's my update to date list of favorite tools for:\n\nis my latest favorite suite of tools. It's got great mindmaps, sticky notes (kanban board on steroids), flowcharts and wireframes. It's one of only four tabs I keep pinned in my browser because I use it so frequently.

The ability to create a\n\nof cards anywhere is powerful.\n\ngets out of the way and is a perfect fit for creative thinking.\n\nHere's a\n\nflowchart I made in Whimsical when thinking through one of the boss fight levels in my\n\ngame.\n\nLife's too short to arrange your own windows.

Moom also has some smart external monitor support \u2014 you can tell it to arrange your windows in a certain way when you plug/unplug your monitor(s).\n\nI was a long-time\n\nuser but have recently found myself using\n\nin its place.

But I can't even count how many times a day I need to take measurements or check alignments. The browser dev tools have some\n\ntools around this, but I've fallen completely in love with\n\n. It lets me take multiple measurements quickly, leave them there if I wish, change some code and refresh the page, and see if my the resulting measurements are correct. It's completely awesome.

Snagit lets you mark up your screenshots with text/arrows, edit/crop, and somehow even adjust the position of things in the screenshot, which feels like black magic.\n\nkeeps track of all your screenshots too. Here's what it looks like as I work on this post:\n\nI'm comfortable with Git on the command line, but sometimes a nice GUI makes for a much better workflow. My editor (VSCode) has a built-in Git GUI but it doesn't come close to\n\nthat I've used and loved for years. I've prevented checking in many a\n\nthanks to the visual commit preview. It makes working with branches fast and easy, and the search feature is quite good.\n\nI've also recently added the\n\nto my workflow as it's the best thing there is currently for working with pull requests locally. Tower has\n\npull request functionality but it's not caught up yet to Github CLI.\n\nI used to panic when I'd see merge conflicts. If you've ever left a branch alive too long you know the feeling. I'm starting to think perhaps that feeling of panic is just a sign that I don't have the right tool yet. Since discovering and getting familiar with\n\nthere's no diff that can scare me. I especially love their three-way diff, that shows the two changesets on the sides and the (editable) merge results in the middle. It lets you go through each change one at a time and decide what to do with it. You can configure Tower to use Kaleidoscope as your diff tool so whenever Tower detects a conflict, it will open the file for you in Kaleidoscope for you to resolve.\n\nAs I work, my open browser tabs seem to multiply like\n\n. I used to get completely overwhelmed by the sheer number of them until I discovered\n\n. It's a powerful Chrome extension (Firefox and Edge coming soon I hear) that lets you organize your tabs into\n\n. Each workspace has its own set of tabs that you need. When I'm writing an article like I am now, I switch to my\n\nworkspace. Workona closes everything but the four tabs I need. If I get a bug report for\n\nI'll switch to my\n\nworkspace and I'm ready to go.\n\nis perfect and I can't believe it's free. If they ever launch a pro plan I'll be the first to sub.\n\nHere's what it looks like in my Blog workspace:\n\nMy first design tool love was Fireworks (RIP). When that died I tried to switch to Illustrator but it never felt great. Then Sketch came along and was my go to for a lot of years. Most recently\n\nwas released and after making my new logo in it I was hooked. The navigation (zoom/pan/etc) alone is flawless and has ruined other apps like Photoshop for me. It's very fast even when there are a ton of assets on a page. It's a paragon of the possibilities of\n\n.\n\nNo code editor beats\n\nthese days. The app is fast, the plugin/theme ecosystem is strong, and it's highly customizable. For example I recently made its terminal panes\n\nand it was a piece of cake. I love that whenever there's a tiny bit of friction in my workflow, I can often eliminate it through customization.\n\nis the gift that keeps on giving.\n\nMy favorite theme as of late is\n\nwith the clean\n\nfont. So much purple! Gosh dang I love purple. It doesn't get much prettier than this.\n\nYou see this styled blog but as I write I get to look at this beauty:\n\nThe browser devtools have really good color pickers these days, but they only work in the browser. So my color picker is the one in\n\n. I like that it stores the colors I've picked recently to save me some work. And I like that I can easily switch from hex to rgb. I don't really use all the rest of xScope's tools though, so I am on the lookout for a better/cheaper standalone color picker. If you love yours please let me know!\n\nSetting up a new computer is a pain, but I've automated most of it using\n\n. In a single\n\nI list all the tools & apps (even App Store ones!), and fonts that I use. Running\n\nsets up a brand new computer in minutes. It just takes a bit of discipline as you go to add things to your\n\ninstead of manually installing them with\n\n. But if you're a lazy sack you can just run the\n\ncommand to create a new\n\nthat lists everything you have currently installed. But I prefer to keep my setup clean and intentional. Here's my current\n\nin case you're curious what else I use.\n\nI use\n\nfor custom keyboard shortcuts for my\n\n. There's a similar program for Windows called\n\nthat I may or may not have used to cheat in Starcraft2 as a kid.\n\nWindows has an easy way of uninstalling most things, but for some reason macOS doesn't. So I use\n\nwhen I want to get rid of an app and all its files. We don't need that junk lying around now, do we!\n\nThis one is more of a hobby tool for me, but\n\nblows my mind. I use mainly for designing and 3D printing things around the house, as well as custom board game accessories cause I'm a nerd like that. I've written before about how our industry could\n\nfrom Fusion's advanced editing/timeline tools.\n\nHere are the\n\nI designed for my favorite card game\n\n.\n\nI've used\n\nsince my very first Mac and it's been great.

You probably know the feeling well - you're trying your hardest to figure something out, but solid ideas just aren't coming. You take a shot at one\n\nsolution after another as the frustration rises.\n\n.\n\nSomething they never tell you is that even the most experienced professionals get stumped on a regular basis. In fact I think \"what are you currently stuck on?\" would make a fantastic interview question. So when you get stuck, don't get discouraged. Instead see it as a sign that you're challenging yourself and progressing in your skills. But what should you do in the moment when you're stuck?\n\n?\n\nYou know the song\n\nby Simon and Garfunkel? Paul Simon had this catchy tune his in mind but was having a rough time coming up with lyrics for it. He was stuck. I can imagine him in a striped shirt and leather jacket, plucking notes on his guitar, experimenting with a bunch of\n\nphrases. Eventually something\n\nand he used this lack of inspiration as the inspiration itself. He wrote\n\nto lament about that feeling of helplessness when your source of inspiration is fleeting. His lyrics make a lot of sense when you realize who Cecilia is - the\n\naccording to the Catholic tradition.\n\nCecilia, you're breaking my heart\n\nYou're shaking my confidence daily\n\nOh Cecilia, I'm down on my knees\n\nI'm begging you please to come home\n\nSt Cecilia, by painter Nicolas Poussin\n\nPaul got unstuck by writing about the problem he was facing. If a celebrated songwriter who composed around\n\ncan get stuck, so can you and I.\n\nThe other day I was trying to solve what I felt like should have been a fairly easy problem. I wanted to create a sweet laptop sticker layout using hexagons and characters from my UI Mastery Games\n\nand\n\n.\n\nI started sketching some ideas on my iPad and was feeling pretty good about it.\n\nI wanted to give the main characters like Meg some bigger stickers, yet still have all the hex shapes fit together nicely. One idea I tried was lengthening Meg's hexagon shape like this:\n\nBut that left an awkward little gap near the bottom. An idea to fix that would be to make the tall shape even taller:\n\nBut this still had a problem where you wouldn't be able to place any stickers underneath the tall one and have them fit all perfectly together.\n\nI played around with about a dozen increasingly crappy ideas before realizing I was frustrated and stuck. I put my mac to sleep, rubbed my eyes, and decided to try something different.\n\nThe first thing I did is write down as concisely as possible the problem I was trying to solve. I wrote \"make an awesome layout for my laptop stickers, that fans will be proud to show off\". Just writing it down seemed to relieve some stress and give me clarity.\n\nAfter that I asked myself \"what constraints am I operating under right now?\". I wrote them down:\n\nI was going to keep working at it, but we had a family outing planned that I didn't want to miss. So I closed my laptop and took my wife and kids to enjoy the fall festivities at Cornbelly's. While launching my kids on the zip lines and devouring terrible fair food I didn't think about my layout problem once. But when we passed by this shoe cubby I couldn't help but stop and stare:\n\nAnd just like that, something clicked. My mind drew lines around these hexagon shapes in a way that would be absolutely perfect for my layout:\n\nBecause I had clarified what I was trying to solve, I had defined\n\nfor my brain to chew on in the background. Because I had\n\n, I was free to discard many of them. I didn't\n\nto lengthen a hexagon to make a bigger sticker: I could just use two vertically. Or three in an L-shape. And they'll always fit together perfectly. I didn't have to use pointy tips up, that's just the way I'm used to seeing them on most people's laptops. Thanks to this strike of inspiration I'm no longer stuck on the project and am excited to show you the final result when they're done.\n\nI didn't realize it at the time, but this is the same way I got unstuck the time I had a crazy webgl perf issue\n\nFlexbox Zombies. Having learned from these and other experiences I'm now able to extract a formula:\n\nIf you do this there's a good chance you'll randomly think of something when you least expect it. It also helps to talk through the problem with a friend, get their take on things. Just remember that inspiration takes time to strike and you can't rush it. But if in a day or two if you still haven't solved it, come back to the problem fresh and try again. It's important to\n\n- that's what gives your mind more raw input materials to work with. You may hit another wall or three and that's totally fine. Just repeat these steps as many times as it takes.

I was an OK player, hovering in gold or silver league.\n\nIf you're played the game you'll be familiar with the alien Zerg race.\n\nI loved playing Zerg, but to keep up with your opponent you have to remember to quickly \"spawn larvae\" with your queens on all your bases every 28 seconds.\n\nOne day I got tired of this annoying, repetitive task and decided to automate it.\n\nI wrote a little macro that would do the whole task automatically and instantly, every 28 seconds.\n\nThanks to my macro I was able to focus my attention on the fun gameplay mechanics. Within a week I had advanced to Diamond league.\n\nNote: I don't recommend this in games because it's pretty much cheating and I felt bad about it so I stopped using my macro before Blizzard banned me :)\n\nBut when it comes to coding, this kind of productive cheating is encouraged!\n\nMost editors support\n\n- a convenient way to write new lines of code.\n\nMacros on the other hand are fantastic for automating all the repetitive actions you perform on the code you've already written.\n\nYou probably don't even realize how frequently you do the same sequences.\n\nThe first step to leveling up your coding with macros is to identify the right sequences.\n\nLook for sequences that:\n\nFor example here's something I noticed I do all the time. I have a line of code (constructor, function call, etc) that I want to adjust.\n\nBut I still want to keep the original line around until I'm happy with my change. So I copy the line down, move cursor up, comment out the original line, and move the cursor to the new line to edit.\n\nNow I can adjust the new line until I'm happy with what it does, and delete the old line.\n\nThis little sequence takes 4 actions. So I wrote a macro to do it with a single keystroke.\n\nAt first it takes some deliberate practice, coding while also paying attention to the meta game: looking for sequences you didn't even realize you depend on daily.\n\nKeep a piece of paper next to your keyboard. Every time you use a sequence of actions, name it something that briefly describes it, and write it down on the paper. Also write down the number of actions it takes.\n\nEvery time you use it, put a tally mark next to it. You'll soon have a very clear picture of things you can automate. For example:\n\nThe more you use a sequence and the more keystrokes a macro would save you the better.\n\nBefore writing a macro, check first to see if your editor already has a command that does what you need. If not, write your own!\n\nMany editors like vim, Sublime Text, Webstorm etc have built in support for macros.\n\nI've been using VS Code lately and am liking it.\n\nIt doesn't have macro support though so I wrote\n\n- cleverly named \"macros\" - that makes writing macros super easy.\n\nWhichever editor you use, start finding the repetitive, tedious parts if your coding life and code that junk away with macros!"}

Giving everyone root would permit anyone in the organisation to fix their own problems, deploy their own software, or, less charitably, cowboy things or be downright naughty. And while everyone had root, it usually turned out that only the operations team had the on call pager.\n\nAfter the wholesale failure of organisations to\n\n, I\u2019m a big fan of the\n\nmovement. So when George Barnett and I built the\n\nwe made a deliberate decision that everyone would get the same tools, and (modulo permissions and audit logs) be empowered to use the platform to the full extent. There wouldn\u2019t be one set of tools for regular users, and a super set of \u201cpower tools\u201d reserved for operators.\n\nTo me\n\n, means if you have a problem, we\u2019ll help you learn to use the tools better, not fix your problem for you.\n\nI remember playing with VMware in 1999 or early 2000. I thought it was an amazing trick, especially as the drivers for my sound card worked way better in virtualized Windows than the real thing.\n\nFast forward a few years and I was using VMware to maintain a fleet of foreign language Windows installations for testing. Skip forward a few more and the industry had figured out that virtualisation was a solution to the sprawl of single use Windows servers that cluttered up wiring cupboards and data centres.\n\nVirtualisation is a neat trick taken well beyond the point of a joke, but it did shine a light on the dark corners of systems administration. Back when turning up a server involved purchase orders, waiting for hardware to be shipped, contract negotiations, and trips to the data centre, what was a few hours spent installing the operating system? But when virtual hardware could be conjured out of thin air in seconds, it cast a long shadow over the need to automate operating system installation and management.\n\nThis was the age of Puppet and Chef, who re-plowed the ground sowed a decade earlier by CFEngine. Now sysadmins could configure and manage servers at the speed they could be virtually provisioned. I remember, thinking back to when I started to use Puppet, and imagining about what it would have been like to have those tools in previous jobs, where automation involved SVN repositories full of perl scripts, and crontab entries lovingly copy pasta\u2019d between machines. And so everything was good for a time in the age of configuration as code.\n\nBut, simulating the entirety of an x86 host on another, just so people can share a computer, is a ridiculous waste. This shouldn\u2019t be a surprise, FreeBSD Jails and Solaris Zones (rest in peace) had been coughing loudly about this for decades. Bryan Cantrill said it best when he exclaimed that we should \u201c\n\n\u201c, or as we\u2019ve come to know them: containers.\n\nI remember where I saw Docker for the first time. The product wasn\u2019t even a year old and Docker were carpet bombing any meetup that would have them to promote it. Canonical were sprinting at a hotel near SFO and I convinced several of my teammates to squeeze into a taxi for the first meetup in San Mateo. What I saw that night shook me to my core. It wasn\u2019t just the speed\u2013oh the speed, after spending two years waiting for EC2 and slow apt mirrors\u2013it was the clarity of that Californian mindset:\n\nIt was clear to me that night that virtual machines were virtualising stuff that people didn\u2019t care about; virtual video cards, virtual floppy drives, virtual ram that swapped to virtual disks. What people wanted was a virtual kernel\u2013their own pid 1. Orchestration tools like Chef, Puppet,\n\nwere trying to orchestrate an entire operating system when what developers really wanted was a way to take a single program, the one that they had written, and deploy it to a server. Filesystems, crontabs,\n\n/\n\n/\n\n,\n\nand\n\n, weren\u2019t just someone else\u2019s problem, they were irrelevant.\n\nAnyone who\u2019s endured to my rants about product knows my unwavering belief in the\n\n. Through the window of Christensen\u2019s logic, it was clear that the server orchestration market had been upended in that moment. Squeezed between Docker images at the low end and Netflix\u2019s \u201ceverything is an AMI\u201d model at the top end, was a large middle ground filled with orchestration tools that expected to be given a\n\noperating system to configure. The Chefs and Puppets and whatnots would be desperately trying to convince the biggest orchestration users\u2013the Netflixes of the world, with their CI/CD pipelines that pooped AMIs\u2013to adopt agent based tooling, while all the while each developer faced with the question \u201cHow should I deploy my application?\u201d would default to\n\n.\n\nIf you\u2019re building your own orchestration layer, then you are betting on the wrong horse\u2013I say this as someone who\u2019s built a\n\n.\n\nWithin the next year or two you\u2019ll be able to buy access to a Kubernetes API server at every price point; on your laptop, shared as a VPS, in your own VPC, or even as an appliance. Building on top of the Kubernetes primitives is where the value lies. Building on top of the shared tooling the Kubernetes API provides the level playing field that every development team who is responsible for supporting their own software in production is entitled to.\n\nWhy did I join\n\n? Because I believe that the administration of operating systems has reached its endgame. Kubernetes is going to revolutionise the way software is developed, and deployed, and I\u2019m honoured to be given the opportunity to join the company that is going to make that happen."}

In every instance I have met experienced, passionate, pragmatic programmers ready to accept Go for what it can do for them.\n\nAt the same time the message from each of these communities was the same; where is the documentation, where are the examples, where are the tutorials\u00a0? Travelling to these communities has been an humbling experience and has made me realise my privileged position as a native English speaker.\n\nThe documentation, and the tutorials, and the examples will come, slowly; this is open source after all.

I ended up writing way more than they asked for.\n\nIf you are a Nerd like me,\u00a0I hope you find some of this advice helpful.\n\nOf course you should do your research before talking about something, but also (re)read writing that you enjoyed as inspiration, analyse its style, analyse what qualities you enjoyed unrelated to its topic.\n\nRe-watch presentations that you enjoyed, you are going to be doing a presentation after all, analyse the style of the presentation, the manner of the speaker, the way they presented their argument, the way they present themselves on stage.\n\nIn this respect, imitation is the most sincere form of flattery.\n\nDon\u2019t write in the passive voice, ever. If you don\u2019t know what I mean, read\n\n.\n\nThe TL;DR of the passive voice is sounding like a CEO or a politician. Always use the first person or second person pronouns, I and You, to assign ownership of an idea or responsibility to someone, don\u2019t leave it hanging out there with phrases like \u201cwe should\u201d.\n\nIn order of importance you need\n\nThe conclusion is your position, your idea, your argument, your call to action, summarised in one slide.\n\nDon\u2019t start writing until you know how your talk ends.\n\nThe introduction should set the stage for the conclusion.\n\nThe rest of the talking points should flow logically from the proposition established in the introduction. They should be relevant and supportive of the conclusion. If a point does not relate to the introduction, or support the conclusion then either rewrite it, drop it, or in extreme cases reconsider your conclusion.\n\nEvery presentation will have a minimum and maximum time limit; if you don\u2019t know it, ask the organiser, don\u2019t guess. All things being equal it is preferable to finish sooner than to run overtime. Here are some of the techniques I use for planning my talk.\n\nThe two key elements are word count and the number of slides.\n\nI prefer to write my talks in full as a paper, you may choose to speak to bullet points, it\u2019s very much personal choice. Either way you have a set number of words to work with for your presentation.\n\nThe average speaking pace for native English speakers is around 120 to 130 words per minute. You can use this to calculate the number of words a presentation will require.\n\nProfessional speakers will talk slower, around 100 words per minute. Don\u2019t assume that you will be able to to do this unless you have had a lot of practice at public speaking. Plan for a higher word rate and write accordingly. It will be easier to speed up during your talk if you are short on time, than to make yourself slow down if you are panicking.\n\nA good rule of thumb is 2,000 to 2,500 words for a 20 minute presentation, 4,000 to 5,000 for a 45 minute slot.\n\nAim to finish ahead of time so people can prove they were listening by asking questions.\n\nI budget on one supporting slide per minute. So 18 to 20 slides for a 20 minute presentation, 35 to 40 for a 45 minute presentation.\n\nI\u2019ve found this to be a pretty reliable rule of thumb regardless of the style of presentation or how I have prepared for it.\n\nYou may want to structure your slides with one bullet point per slide rather than one topic, but don\u2019t think \u201cthis will take less time\u201d. It might be true, but it risks any small delay in covering a slide multiplying through your deck and blowing your time limit.\n\nIf you are running short on time it is easier to summarize slides with multiple points on tham to catch up without looking like you\u2019re rushing.\n\nRead through your talk multiple times to check your material and time yourself \u2013 this is why I prefer to write my talks in full, it helps avoid the temptation to skip the rehearsal of parts that I\n\nI know well.\n\nWith all respect to conference organisers, the presentation stage is the most hostile environment you will encounter. Every effort is made by the organisers to mitigate this, but the bottom line is, if things go to shit, you still have to do your talk, so plan for things to fail.\n\nIf your talk is formatted for wide screen, assume the projector is from the stone age and you\u2019ll have to use someone else\u2019s 4:3 laptop. If there is an opportunity to practice in the space, take it.\n\nAssume the internet won\u2019t work. Yup, it\u2019s 2015 and internet is everywhere, except on stage. This is super important if you use tools like Google present or anything that uses web fonts.\n\nAlso assume that multi monitor set ups just won\u2019t work, so all that clever shit that keynote does is useless, have a fall back.\n\nLarger conferences will either request, or demand that you use their laptops, even to the point of asking for presentation material well in advance. The lowest common denominator here is PDF, so whatever tool you use, make sure it can emit a PDF.\n\nBecause of these difficulties, if you plan to use speaking notes, you should have a way to access those independent of your presentation software. I\u2019ve found copying the text into a Google doc works well and lets me edit my speech after the presentation materials have been handed over to the organisers.\n\nBeware that Goggle docs is really pedantic about being online, so don\u2019t assume that just because the document was open on your laptop before lunch, it\u2019ll work on stage. If in doubt export your notes to a PDF.\n\nEstablishing contact with the audience is one of the hardest things for me. There are many aspects of this\n\nDuh, who doesn\u2019t say that ? The fact is you will be nervous, or if not nervous, excited, so you will talk faster than you plan to.\n\nThe key is to take time for yourself.\n\nIf you\u2019re reading from a script, then start a new paragraph between points and remind yourself to take a deep breath.\n\nIt gives the audience time to read the material on the slide before you start to speak. This is important because while you know it backwards and forwards, this is probably the first time the audience is getting a chance to see your idea.\n\nIf you feel uncomfortable then fill that time by taking a drink of water or walking to a different part of the stage. The latter is my favourite because it gives you excuse to take another pause to walk back.\n\nYour throat will get dry during your talk, this is part of our fight or flight response to stressful situations; it\u2019s the adrenaline. If it happens, don\u2019t let it throw you, focus on pausing between points. Take a drink of water to insert a pause into your presentation, but don\u2019t panic if taking a drink doesn\u2019t fix the problem, that\u2019ll just make it worse.\n\nLastly, don\u2019t beat yourself up afterwards.\n\nPublic speaking is a skill that needs practice, it\u2019s not something that any of us are born with. This is why they make us practice public speaking in high school. But it\u2019s probably been a long time since you and I were in high school, and we probably didn\u2019t realise the importance of what we were being taught at the time.\n\nSo, don\u2019t expect to be awesome every time, and don\u2019t put yourself in a position where your talk must be awesome. This isn\u2019t an interview, it\u2019s not a binary thing, even if you were nervous, or talked too fast, or realised that you crapped up one point in your argument, it\u2019s still ok, the audience will still get a lot from it.\n\nThis is\u00a0a short post to recognise the incredible contribution Alex Brainman has made to the Go project.\n\nAlex was responsible for the port of Go to Windows way back before Go 1 was even released. Since that time he has virtually single-handedly supported Go and Go users on Windows. It\u2019s no wonder that he is the 10th most active contributor to the project.\n\nThe Windows build is consistently\n\nmost popular download from the official go site.\n\nWhile I may not use Windows, and you may not use Windows, spare a thought for the large body of developers who\n\nuse Windows to develop Go programs and are able to do so because of Alex\u2019s efforts.\n\nEven if your entire business doesn\u2019t use Windows, consider the moment when your product manager comes to you and asks \u201cso, we\u2019ve got a request from a big customer to port our product to Windows, that\u2019s not going to be hard, right ?\u201d. Your answer is directly attributable to Alex\u2019s contributions.\n\nAlex, every Go programmer owes you a huge debt of gratitude. So let me be the first to say it, thank you for everything you have done for Go. None of us would be as successful as we are today without your work."}

Here's my all-time favorite gear so far \u2014 I hope you enjoy!\n\nNote: I was able to line up affiliate links for a handful of these, so if you buy using my links I may earn a bit o' cash that I'll put towards more free games like\n\n. You don't pay any extra and in some cases even get a discount.\n\nI'll keep this list up to date as new/better things come along!\n\nI'm a big fan of having a dual, vertical monitor setup. You get tons of screen real estate without having to crane your neck side to side. I searched far and wide for a heavy duty monitor arm that could support the weight of two big monitors. The\n\nis a dream come true. I've had it for over two years now and it hasn't failed me once. Having both monitors attached to a single arm means you can move the entire thing forward/back/up/down as you please. It's fantastic.\n\nI like putting code on the bottom monitor, browser on the top monitor. Here's the desk where the magic happens:\n\nI got some\n\nrecently and stuck them to the back edge of my desk. It has completely transformed and upgraded my office space. I can set the colors to whatever vibrant mood I'm in. Or a nice bright white for working. It's hard to describe the effect, but it just makes my working environment feel welcoming and ready for me to be productive in.\n\nis an incredible, split mechanical keyboard. I've had about a dozen different keyboards for coding and this one's my favorite. It's the only keyboard (that I know of) that lets you swap out the key switches. I started with Cherry Blues switches but found the clicky click a bit too distracting. Switched out to the softer Gateron Brown switches and they're just right.\n\nYou can control its LED atmosphere lights and customize all the keys with their\n\n. Here's my current setup with the (optional) blank keycaps:\n\nThe\n\nis an excellent mouse. I've had the previous two versions of this mouse as well, and each model upgrade has added a little bit of polish. The mouse is ergonomic, comfortable, tracks well on my slick bamboo desk surface, has decently big side buttons for back/forward, and an overall quality/industrial feel.\n\nAfter a ton of research and a few returns, I went with the\n\nbackpack. They're a small company not far from where I live here in the valley, and they make a really good bag. I've used mine heavily for over a year and the rugged thing is still good as new. It's made from a water-resistent canvas-like material that reminds me of camping as a kid. It has tons of pockets for all my stuff: laptop, iPad, chargers, headphones, notebook etc. You can get all sorts of accessories for it like a camera/drone insert. It's comfy on the ol' back, and is compact enough to be good for taking my rig on flights and to conferences.\n\nAnother local company makes this minimalist\n\nand it's perfect. Super slim, fits just a handful of things but that's all I need. I got one for my dad to see if I could get him to switch away from his ultra thick 80's style leather wallet, but no luck.\n\nI've been tryout out\n\n. I like the idea of evolving my own custom system for staying on top of everything. I'm just using the\n\nand it's quality.\n\nI'm a big fan of these ultra thin (0.38)\n\npens. They let you create small, neat writings which is perfect for journaling and\n\n. They dry fast, don't bleed through the page, and are waterproof once dry.\n\nI also like these fine tip (0.05)\n\n, but they don't seem to last very long.\n\nSince I build (education) games for a living, I figure it's important to play plenty of other games for\n\npurposes ;) I wanted a better gaming monitor that wasn't crazy expensive, and ultimately picked the\n\n. The high 144hz refresh rate makes a huge difference for games \u2014\u00a0everything is super smooth. Having g-sync is a nice, I no longer get screen tearing when I play Overwatch. This monitor is a VA panel instead of the more common IPS panel, so blacks are\n\n. Which is exactly what you want if you play games with lots of shadows (e.g.\n\n) or space (e.g.\n\n) like I do. This monitor doesn't have some of the newer tech like HDR or 4k, but you really don't need those for games yet. Like all tech, 4k and HDR are crazy expensive when new but will come down in price in a couple years.\n\nSpace games, and this monitor, are Pippin approved.\n\nI'm always trying new things and will keep this list up to date as I find more awesome gear. If you've got something you love that you think I'd enjoy please let me know!\n\nFlexbox is incredibly powerful. But it's also crazy hard to master. So\n    we all end up depending on a cheat sheet and guessing in the dev\n    tools. Enough of that! Time to master it once and for all, in a way\n    that actually sticks, so you can build any layout you can imagine with\n    flexbox."}
{"url": "https://mastery.games/post/practice-css/", "origin": "https://gedd.ski/", "title": "Practice CSS Like an Artist", "content": "As a kid I became interested in oil painting. My dad is a professional artist and I wanted to be like him. One day I asked if he would teach me. The invaluable lesson he gave me shaped how I learned to code and how I became good at CSS.\n\nOur house was like one big art gallery \u2014 paintings, pottery & sculptures everywhere. Dad walked me over to the nearest Arlo Coles painting on the wall, and said \"\n\n\":\n\nI asked. \"\n\n\" he replied. When pressed for more help, he said \"\n\n\"\n\nI did my best to copy this awesome painting. The result wasn't very good, but I learned a lot. He had me try again and again. Here's one attempt that I actually kept:\n\nTrying to recreate great work is one of the most effective ways to improve any skill\u2014 not just art. I used this same exercise to learn web development. I'd find a website that I thought looked slick, and I'd try to recreate it myself.\n\nSometimes I'd have to cheat and peek under the hood with the devtools. I'd see things in the code that made zero sense, and I'd have to go study them. I learned\n\nmuch doing this. It was way more effective than any of my University assignments. If you're at all like me, you\n\n.\n\nObviously it's not cool to rip off someone else's work and pass it off as your own, so only use this as a learning exercise.\n\nTo this day I still use this exercise to continue refining my skills. I'm often inspired by the UIs in video games. The designs and interactions are exciting. Recreating them really stretches your coding skills. Plus it means you\n\nto play games... for research ;)\n\nHere you can watch me build the\n\nand the\n\n.\n\nFrom a lifetime of teaching students, my dad knew to help me avoid the biggest pitfall: getting caught up in the details too soon. His\n\nadvice was incredibly helpful. But he didn't come up with the idea. Great artists have been using this principle for centuries.\n\nA classic example can be seen in\n\n's famous\n\n.\n\nWith a few bold, sweeping strokes he defines the composition of each piece. He probably\n\nto work fast as he preferred to draw the lions while they fed. Delacroix was masterful at capturing the overall essence, leaving the fine details for later.\n\nSo how do we apply this broad strokes principle to practicing CSS?\n\nCSS has a ton of properties, but you could group them into just two categories:\n\nor\n\n.\n\nThe primary broad stroke tools are Grid, Flexbox, and Position. All the rest are fine details: hover interactions, animations, padding, borders, clip-path etc.\n\nTo use broad strokes, you build the site\n\n. You focus first on the overall composition. CSS Grid is\n\ngood for this, as it lets you define an entire\n\nin a\n\n.\n\nIn the book\n\n, Bert Dodson clarifies the broad strokes principle. He's talking about pencil strokes but might as well be talking about divs:\n\nRule #1. Draw the large shapes first, then the smaller shapes... it's easier to work from the general to the specific than the other way around. Start with the largest shape you see. Forget everything else and draw that shape... Now you have something you can build on, restate, compare with surrounding shapes, subdivide into smaller shapes, etc.\n\nDodson also teaches a nifty little trick: you\n\nand look at your subject. By squinting you can no longer see a lot of the small details, but just the big broad shapes. Try it next time you go to build a layout!\n\nI encourage every dev to master these broad strokes tools of layout. I've made this as easy and fun as possible with my\n\nand\n\nmastery games. Once you have those broad stroke tools down, practice CSS by recreating the awesome work you admire. You'll\n\nat CSS before you know it!\n\nMaster CSS Grid right from the start by playing this new mastery\n    game. You'll learn the ins and outs of Grids one fun level at a time,\n    while saving an adorable alien life form from certain destruction."}
{"url": "https://mastery.games/post/deliberate-practice/", "origin": "https://gedd.ski/", "title": "Mastery through Deliberate Practice", "content": "A new student of mine recently shared his code-learning journey so far: he had watched countless videos on web development. But whenever he'd go to actually build something himself he couldn't remember how most of it worked. The smallest snag and he was stumped. He constantly felt frustrated and discouraged that all his time and effort spent wasn't translating into to actual skills. He wondered if he was even cut out for this. He was\n\n.\n\nWhenever I crack open a new board game I've never played before, I like to watch a video of someone experienced with the game explaining its concepts and rules. I read through the manual, setup the board, and try it out myself. Without fail, I get stuck and have to google for answers to my many questions:\n\nIf it's a complex (and amazing) game like\n\nthen it's going to take dozens of game nights before everything really clicks. Watching more tutorials isn't going to help at this point\u2014 you've just gotta play the game.\n\nLearning to code is the same way. The concepts are abstract and the rules are complex. New tech (like expansion packs) are constantly released. You don't need one more tutorial\u2014 you've just gotta play the game. Use the tech yourself. Build something (a lot of things) with it. This is the\n\nyou'll master it. It's the\n\nyou're ever going to get to the point where you can just sit down and work, without having to constantly stop and reference the rulebook. And that's when the\n\nfun begins.\n\nBefore you can learn anything you must first\n\n. Then once you begin to learn something, you start by loading information into your short-term memory. This is where reading blog posts, following tutorials etc is helpful. But don't stop there. And especially don't move on to something else too soon. Trying to cram a whole new topic into your overburdened prefrontal cortex isn't very effective. Your short-term storage centers only have so much capacity. Like a computer's RAM, if it runs out of space then new data will overwrite previous data.\n\nBefore moving on it's important to convert that fresh information into something more stable and long-term. For this you have two options: declarative memory and procedural memory.\n\nWhen you intentionally memorize information, your brain transfers that data via the hippocampus to the temporal cortex for safekeeping. This is an\n\n,\n\nmemory\u2014 you intentionally allocated space for it. Examples of this process would be memorizing CSS properties, or taking notes about JavaScript Array methods.\n\nTo be useful to you later, this type of memory has to be re-loaded back into working (short-term) memory. Similar to loading data from a computer hard drive back into RAM. This process is relatively slow and takes effort.\n\nThere is a much better long-term option for skills like coding: the cerebellum (and friends). Unlike memorization,\n\nmemories arrive here\n\n\u2014 on their own, often unintentionally. The process happens automatically simply by\n\nsomething. Procedural memory is formed every time you set a CSS property and watch the results. Every time you write a function implementation and check the result it returns.\n\nEvery time you write (or edit) code, you create (or strengthen) procedural memories.\n\nRecall of procedural memory is instant, unconscious, and effortless. Right now you are reading this post without having to remember how to read. Later you'll write an email or slack message without having to remember how to type. At this level the skill becomes natural, effortless. And it's completely possible to get there with coding skills.\n\nProcedural memory is also sometimes called\n\n, because when it was first discovered it was initially believed to only apply to motor skills (e.g. driving a car, playing the piano). But studies of people with amnesia (who are unable to form declarative memory) has broadened our understanding.\n\nProcedural memory is the superior long-term storage option, and creating it in students for coding skills is the primary goal of\n\n.\n\nThink of the last time you sat down to code something up. Was it effortless? Or did you have to work to remember how? Or did you have to work to remember where you might have seen the answer before as you go look it up? This simple exercise will reveal to you which long-term memory drive your coding skills are\n\nresiding in.\n\nBut don't get down on yourself if you realize you're mostly using declarative memory! We are all that way, in a lot of areas! The takeaway though is that you don't have to settle for that for your coding skills. You can have it better. You can transform yourself into a beast of a procedural memory machine.\n\nHow do we go about transitioning to this ideal type of memory?\n\nDoing something on repeat will form procedural memories. But mindless repetition isn't the most effective strategy. Deliberate practice is the key. With deliberate practice you pick a\n\nthing you'd like to improve, and you do it. Over and over, making sure you have good feedback to know whether you're doing it correctly.\n\nIn\n\nstudents spend an entire learning session on a single CSS Grid property like\n\n. They learn the ins and outs of the property, then solve challenge after challenge using it as the key component of the layout.\n\nMost courses and tutorials don't include the deliberate practice component, but you can set it up for yourself. It's not too complicated:\n\nDo this consistently and before you know it you'll notice yourself gaining the\n\n.\n\nSay you want to learn\n\n. Start with blog posts, videos or the great resources on\n\nand\n\n. Great! Your short-term memory is loaded up. Now go build a lot of things with what you just learned. Find layouts you think look nice and see if you can recreate them yourself. Direct that fresh information straight into your procedural memory centers. The more times you do it, the better.\n\nIn my\n\nI shared the story of how I used deliberate practice to get better at StarCraft2. You can use deliberate practice to get quite good at literally anything.\n\nThe student I told you about at the beginning of this post wrote me back a few weeks later, after using the deliberate practice I provide in my Mastery Games. He was ecstatic to tell me that\n\nand\n\nhad finally\n\nfor him. Not only had he escaped from tutorial hell, he now had the confidence to go master anything else himself. That's the power of using deliberate practice to form long-term procedural memory.\n\nBy the way,\n\nis currently on a huge sale. Save a ton of time creating your own deliberate practice sessions for CSS Grid. I've got the full Mastery Game experience ready and waiting for you.\n\nMaster CSS Grid right from the start by playing this new mastery\n    game.

So I wanted to collect & share them here for any web devs/designers/etc who might need a little boost today. Here are 80 reasons to love the web:\n\nOn the web, everyone has a chance to reach out and connect with other like-minded individuals and share in this wondrous thing we call life.\n\nThe barrier to entry for new web developers is still low. Prototyping a new idea is as easy here as it is anywhere, and these two advantages have naturally led to a third: a vibrant, community of brilliant, creative minds. The web is able to foster superior community because community is built into its DNA. I can think of nowhere else that allows a person to be limited only by his or her imagination and to have access to a community as deep and wide as the web.\n\nThe web is just like us, different is so many ways but actually all alike!\n\nWho knows but maybe if we all remembered that a little more often this world, and the world wide web, might become something even greater!\n\nHow awesome is it that we're even\n\nto argue about things on the internet?

Surprisingly spartan on details, the board implies that the wizards at Brough Real Estate have made two sets of sellers, buyers and a themselves very happy, an increasingly difficult task in the current climate. Less believable is the fact these properties are directly opposite each other.\n\nClearly this is a ruse.\n\nWith a reported 350,000 properties on the market across the country, the question becomes, who is the audience for this call to action?\n\nTo steal a quote from\n\nthe best days of Australian housing bubble may be behind it. As an amateur economist and armchair property speculator I wanted to share my views on this subject.\n\nDuring the 60s and 70s Ashfield, the formerly Polish, now Chinese migrant, inner west suburb of Sydney succumbed to vast swathes of development which saw the majority of Colonial and Fediterania bungalows replaced by two and three story apartment blocks. Due of their ubiquity and near identical layout, these properties provide an opportunity to study the effects of the Australian housing boom on a particular class of asset; the quintessential two bedroom flat.\n\nSkipping forward a few decades to October 2009, it was a heady time for the Sydney housing market, and it was no different for Vendors in Ashfield. Landlords were dumping unrenovated 2 bedroom units onto the private market for $400,000 a pop. Saturday mornings saw Agents, weighed down with keys, leading platoons of eager DINKYs from inspecting to inspection. Estate agents, banks and solicitors were doing a roaring trade on the back of the dying months of the final extension of the First Home Buyers grant. Those who waited for the governments handouts to cease in the hope that the market would cool were out of luck, twelve months later I watched a 2br flat sell at auction for over $520,000.\n\nHowever the present day in Ashfield reveals a different picture. The previous weekend I attended two auctions with similar outcomes. The first apartment, a ground floor flat sold for $370,000 to the first, and only bidder. The second, with rubberneckers spilling onto the stairs, was passed in at $451,000 after the vendor bid failed to push the lacklustre bidding above the reserve.\n\n, and I believe the diagnosis to be accurate. Clearly my shoulder surfing a brace of sales does not represent a trend, and more data is needed before I can say the age of the half million dollar Ashfield flat is over.\n\nWhat is, however, less clear to me, is the prognosis for the price of 70 square meters of real estate in Ashfield."}

With singular exception of Google I/O, every one of these conferences, and every meetup, has spawned from the Go community itself.\n\nWithout a doubt, 2015 is going to be the year of Go.\n\nWhen I was younger, I wanted to learn to play the guitar (this was the 90\u2019s after all). So I cracked open my piggy bank, bought a decent beginners guitar and took some lessons. I regularly bought the guitar magazines that appeared in the local newsagent and practised along to my favourite songs.\n\nI noodled away at this hobby for a few years. I joined a local band, we even recorded a demo, but never got any gigs. I was disillusioned with my progress, sure I could memorise the fingerings and chords, but my playing style was wooden and my tone stank.\n\nFrustrated, I decided that my beginners guitar wasn\u2019t up to the task and again pouring over guitar magazines I invested in a better guitar, a wah pedal, and a fuzz pedal, and a new amplifier which proudly sported the ultimate in guitar fetishism \u2014 a solitary analogue tube.\n\nAlas, I had spent my time working to earn money to buy guitars and accessories instead of\n\n, my tone still stank, and my style remained wooden, and so when I moved out of home, my guitar didn\u2019t follow me.\n\nPhil Haley and is comments, circa 2002\n\nA few years after I joined the workforce, I bought a camera on a whim.\n\nIt was early in 2000, so I suspect this was a present to myself for surviving the Y2K debacle (Dave: 1, Mayans: 0). I discovered that some of my co-workers at the time were also keen on photography and this shared interest lead to heated debates about the benefits of Nikon vs Canon, zoom lenses vs prime lenses, the right film stock, and above all the absolute sharpness of the final product.\n\nSoon our cadre would spend hours searching eBay for bargains, or sneak out early on a Friday to ogle the new arrivals at the 2nd hand camera stores. This was the beginning of the end of 35mm film so cameras which, only a few years prior, had\u00a0been priced outside our reach were suddenly flooding the market.\n\nPretty soon I had amassed a huge array of Nikon lenses, tripods, adapters, cables, and accessories, and at one point I owned every Nikon professional camera from the F to the F4.\n\nTo my credit I put more time into photography than I had into music and after overcoming crippling indecision by whittling my camera collection back to one body and two lenses I started to take images that I was happy with.\n\nInstead of obsessing about the photographs I\n\ntake if I had just the right kit, I started investing that money in books and retrospectives of photographers who I admired.\n\nThis year it has become\n\nGo\u2019s explicit simplicity as crudeness or condescension.\u00a0To those critics\u00a0I say:\n\n.\n\nDespite your hand wringing over the effrontery of Go\u2019s designers to not include your prerequisite features, interest in Go is sky rocketing. Rather than finding new ways to hate a language for reasons that will not change, why not invest that time\u00a0and\n\nthe\n\nof programmers who are using the language to write real software\n\n.\n\nYou\u2019ll be amazed what you can get done when you\u00a0stop looking over your shoulder.\n\nI am frequently contacted by recruiters looking for leads. This isn\u2019t an attempt to blow my own horn, I\u2019m sure you are also constantly pestered.\n\nWhat is frustrating is the recruiters who come calling for leads are universally unaware of the meetups and user groups in the local area for the\n\nRecruiters, how do you expect to be effective in your role as go between if you do not make even the most basic of efforts to join the community for which you are claiming to be proficient in sourcing talent from ?\n\nSeveral decades ago, when I graduated high school and was wondering what I would do with my life I faced a choice. Should I take the now common \u201cgap year\u201d and travel the world, or should I enrol\u00a0directly in university ?\n\nOft quoted wisdom recommends that programmers looking to better themselves in their craft should frequently learn new programming languages.\n\nPolyglotism is in many ways like visiting a new country. You pick a destination from a list that interest you, choose a time when the weather is nice; not too hot, not to rainy, arrange your travel, and book your leave.\n\nMaybe you do a little research before you go, looking up the local attractions and learn a few basic phrases (although you know your accent will always give you away).\n\nTravel helps you broaden your horizons. You get to meet the locals, experience the weather, the food, their dialect. You visit the famous monuments, the popular hangouts, and take in the night life.\u00a0Maybe you have a friend who can show you their favourite haunts, off the beaten track, so you can feel like a local, in the know. Perhaps you hire a guide who helps you experience a safe, less homogenised, version of the city.\n\nThen, once you\u2019ve had your time abroad, exhausted, you slump down in your\u00a0airplane seat to return home. You reflect on the people you\u2019ve met, how their experiences are different to your own, what it would have been like to grow up with their challenges and their opportunities. Then it\u2019s back\u00a0to your old life and your old routine. Maybe, you dream, one day you\u2019ll visit that city again.\n\nThis post is not a rejection of polyglotism any more than it is a rejection of tourism for personal growth.\u00a0There is a great deal of difference between spending a week or two in a foreign city, and emigrating there.\u00a0Don\u2019t think because you\u2019ve spent a week with a language in the summer you know what it is like to live there permanently.\n\nThis is the text of my closing keynote from Gophercon India. It has been slightly altered for readability from my original speaking notes.\n\nI am indebted to the organisers of Gophercon India for inviting\u00a0me to speak, and to Canonical for giving me the time off to attend the conference.\n\nIf you want to see me stumble through the real thing, the video is\n\n.\n\nClosing Keynote, Gophercon India\n\n21 Feb 2015\n\nI want to open my presentation with a proposition.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/davecheney/status/539576755254611968\n\nBeing passionate about Go means being passionate about language advocacy, and a natural hazard of dwelling too long on the nature of programming results in statements like these.\n\nBut underlying the pithy form enforced by a tweet, I believe there is a gem of truth\u2014\n\nOn the other hand, I cannot point to a language introduced in the same time frame with the rallying call of complexity; more complexity than its contemporaries\u2014but many instead claim to be powerful.\n\nThe idea of proposing a language which offered higher levels of inherent complexity is clearly laughable, yet this is exactly what so many contemporary languages have become; complicated, baroque, messes. A parody of the languages they sought to replace.\n\nClumsy syntax and non orthogonality is justified by the difficulty of capturing nuanced corner cases of the language, many of them self inflicted by years of careless feature creep.\n\nSo, every language starts out with simplicity as a goal, yet many of them fail to achieve this goal. Eventually falling back on notions of expressiveness or power of the language as justification for a failure to remain simple.\n\nAny why is this ? Why do so many language, launched with sincere, idealistic goals, fall afoul of their own self inflicted complexity ?\n\nOne reason, one major reason, I believe, is that to be thought successful, a language should somehow include all the popular features of its predecessors.\n\nIf you would listen to language critics, they demand that any new language should push forward the boundaries of language theory.\n\nIn reality\u00a0this appears to be a veiled request that your new language include all the bits they felt were important in their favourite old language, while still holding true to the promise of whatever it was that drew them to investigate your language I the first place.\n\nI believe that this is a fundamentally incorrect view.\n\nWhy would a new language be proposed if not to address limitations of its predecessors ?\n\nWhy should a new language not aim to represent a refinement of the cornucopia of features presented in existing languages, learning from its predecessors, rather than repeating their folly.\n\nLanguage design is about trade-offs; you cannot have your cake and eat it too.\u00a0So I challenge the notion that every mainstream language must be a super-set of those it seeks to replace.\n\nThis brings me back to my tweet.\n\nGo is a language that chooses to be simple, and it does so by choosing to not include many features that other programming languages have accustomed their users to believing are essential.\n\nSo the subtext of this thesis would be; what makes Go successful is what has been left out of the language, just as much as what has been included.\n\nOr as Rob Pike puts it \u201cless is exponentially more\u201d.\n\nWhen raising a new building, engineers first sink long pillars, down to the bedrock to provide a stable foundation for the structure of the building.\n\nTo not do this, to just tamp the area flat, lay a concrete slab and start construction, would leave the building vulnerable to small disturbances from changes in the local area, at risk from rising damp or subsidence due to changes in environmental conditions.\n\nAs programmers, we can recognise this as the parable of leaky abstraction. Just as tall buildings can only be successfully constructed by placing them on a firm foundation, large programs can not be successful if they are placed upon a loose covering of dirt that masks decades of accumulated debris.\n\nYou cannot add simplicity after the fact. Simplicity is only gained by taking things away.\n\nSimplicity does not mean\n\n, but it may mean\n\n\u009d or\n\n.\n\nSomething which is simple may take a little longer, it may be a little more verbose, but it will be more comprehensible.\n\nPutting this into the context of programming languages, a simple programming language may choose to limit the number of semantic conveniences it offers to experienced programmers to avoid alienating newcomers.\n\nSimplicity is not a synonym for easy, nor is achieving a design which is simple an easy task.\n\nJust because something may be simple, don\u2019t mistake it for crude.\n\nWhile lasers are fabulous technology used in manufacturing and medicine, a chef prefers a knife to prepare food.\n\nCompared to the laser, a simple chefs knife may appear unsophisticated, but in truth it represents generations of knowledge in metallurgy, manufacturing and usability.\n\nWhen considering a programming language, don\u2019t mistake a lack of the latest features for a lack of sophistication.\n\n\u201cnothing went in [to the language], until all three of us [Ken, Robert and myself], agreed that it was a good idea.\u201d \u2014 Rob Pike, Gophercon 2014\n\nYou should design your programs with simplicity as a goal, not aim to be pleasantly surprised when your solution happens to be simple.\n\nAs Rob Pike noted at Gophercon last year, Go was not designed by committee. The language represent a distillation of the experiences of Robert Griesemer, Ken Thompson, and himself, and only once all three\u00a0were all convinced of a feature\u2019s utility to the language was it included.\n\nThere is an exponential cost in completeness.\n\nThe 90% solution, a language\u00a0that remains orthogonal while recognizing some things are not possible, verses a language attempting to offer 100% of its capabilities to every possible permutation will inherently be less complex, because as we engineers know,\n\nThe last 10% costs another 90% of the effort.\n\nA lack of simplicity is, of course complexity.\n\nComplexity is friction, a force which acts against getting things done.\n\nComplexity is debt, it robs you of capital to invest in the future.\n\nGood programmers write simple programs.\n\nThey bring their experience, their knowledge and their failures to new designs, to learn from and avoid mistakes in the future.\n\nTo steal a quote from Rich Hickey\n\n\u201cSimplicity is the ultimate sophistication\u201d \u2014\u00a0Leonardo da Vinci\n\nGo is a language designed to be simple. It is a feature, not a by-product, or an accident.\n\nThis was the message that spoke to me when I first learned about the language in 2009, and is the message that has stayed with me to this day.\n\nThe desire for simplicity is woven through every aspect of the language.\n\nMy question for you, the audience: Do you want to write simple programs, or will you settle for writing powerful programs ?\n\nI hope by now I have convinced you that a need for simplicity in programming languages, is self evident, so I want to move to my second topic; collaboration.\n\nIs programming an art or a science ? Are we artists or engineers ? This one question is a debate in itself, but I hope you will humour me that as professionals, programming is a little of both; we are both software artists, and software engineers\u2014and as engineers we work as a team.\n\nThere is more to the success of Go than just being simple, and this is the realization that for a programming language to be successful, it must coexist inside a larger environment.\n\nLarge programs are written by large teams.\u00a0I don\u2019t believe this is a controversial statement.\n\nThe inverse is also true.\u00a0Large teams of programmers, by their nature, produce large code bases.\n\nProjects with large goals will necessitate large teams, and thus their output will be commensurate.\n\nThis is the nature of our work.\n\nGo is a small language, but deliberately designed as a language for large teams of programmers.\n\nSmall annoyances such as a lack of warnings, a refusal to allow unused imports, or unused local variables, are all facets of choices designed to help Go work well for large teams.\n\nThis does not mean that Go is not suitable for the single developer working alone, or a small program written for a specific need, but speaks to the fact that a number of the choices within the language are aimed at the needs of growing software teams.\n\nAnd if your project is successful, your team will grow, so you need to plan for it.\n\nIt may appear heretical to suggest this, as many of the metrics that we as professional software developers are judged by; lines of code written; the number of revisions committed to source control, and so on, are all accounted for character by character. Line by line. File by file.\n\nBut, writing a program, or more accurately solving a problem; delivering a solution, has little to do with the final act of entering the program into the computer.\n\nPrograms are designed, written, debugged and distributed in an environment significantly larger than one programmer\u2019s editor.\n\nGo recognizes this, it is a language designed to work in this larger environment, not in spite of it.\n\nBecause ultimately Go is a language for the problems that exist in today\u2019s commercial programming, not just language theory.\n\nThe author Peter Seibel suggests that programs are not read, but instead decoded.\u00a0In hindsight this should have been obvious, after all we call it\n\n, not\n\n.\n\nThe source code of a program is an intermediary form, somewhere between our concept and the computer\u2019s executable notation.\n\nAs with many transformations, this encoding of the source program is not lossless; some loss of fidelity, some ambiguity, some imprecision is present. This is why when reading source code, you must in fact\n\nit, to divine the original intention of the programmer.\n\nMany of the choices relating to the way Go code is represented as source, speak to this impedance mismatch. The simplicity and regularity of the grammar, while providing few opportunities for individuality, in turn makes it easier for a new reader to decode a Go program and determine its function.\n\nBecause source code is written to be read.\n\nGo is a language designed from the beginning to be transposed, transformed and processed at the source level. This has opened up new fields of analysis and code generation to the wider Go community.\u00a0We\u2019ve seen several examples of this demonstrated at this conference.\n\nWhile these tools are impressive, I believe the regular syntax of a Go source file belies its greatest champion; go fmt.\n\nBut what is it that is so important about go fmt, and why is it important to go fmt your source code ?\n\nPart of the reason is, of course, to avoid needless debate. Large teams will, by their nature have a wide spectrum of views on many aspects of programming, and source code formatting is the most pernicious.\n\nGo is a language for collaboration. So, in a large team, just as in a wider community, personal choices are moderated for a harmonious society.\n\nThe outcome is that nearly all go code is go formatted\n\n. Adherence to this convention is an indicator of alignment with the values of Go.\n\nThis is important because it is a social convention leading to positive reinforcement, which is far more powerful than negative reinforcement of a chafing edict from the compiler writer.\n\nIn fact, code that is not well formatted can be a first order indicator of the suitability of the package.\u00a0Now, I\u2019m not trying to say that poorly formatted code is buggy, but poorly formatted code may be an indication that the authors have not understood the design principles that underscore Go.\n\nSo while buggy code can be fixed, design issues or impedance mismatches can be much harder to address, especially after that code is integrated into your program.\n\nAs Go programmers we can pick up a piece of Go code written by anyone in the world and start to read it.\u00a0This goes deeper than just formatting.\n\nGo lacks heavy libraries like Boost. There are no QT base classes, no gobject. There is no pre-processor to obfuscate. Domain specific language rarely appear in Go code.\n\nThe inclusion of maps and slices in the language side steps the most basic interoperability issues integrating packages from vendors, or other parts of your company. All Go code uses these same basic building blocks; maps, slices and channels, so all Go code is accessible to a reader who is versed in the language, not some quaint organization specific dialect.\n\nIn 1964 Doug McIlroy postulated about the power of pipes for composing programs. This was five years before the first Unix was written mind you.\n\nMcIlroy\u2019s observations became the foundation of the UNIX philosophy; small, sharp tools which can be combined to solve larger tasks, tasks which\u00a0may not have even been envisioned by the original authors.\n\nIn the last few decades, I feel that programmers have lost the ability to compose programs, lost behind waves of run time dependencies, stifling frameworks, and brittle type hierarchies that degrade the ability to move quickly and experiment cheaply.\n\nGo programs embody the spirit of the UNIX philosophy. Go packages interact with one another via interfaces. Programs are composed, just like the UNIX shell, by combining packages together.\n\nI can use fmt.Fprintf to write formatted output to a network connection, or a zip file, or a writer which discards its input. Conversely I can create a gzip reader that consumes data from a http connection, or a string constant, or a multireader composed of several sources.\n\nAll of these permutations are possible, in McIlroy\u2019s vision, without any of the components having the slightest bit of knowledge about the other parts of this processing chain.\n\nInterfaces in Go are therefore a unifying force; they are\n\nmeans of describing behaviour. Interfaces let programmers describe what their package provides, not\n\nit does it.\n\nWell designed interfaces are more likely to be small interfaces; the prevailing idiom here is that interfaces contain\u00a0only a single method.\n\nCompare this to other languages like Java or C++. In those languages interfaces are generally larger, in terms of the method count required to satisfy them, and more complex because of their entanglement with the inheritance based nature of those languages.\n\nInterfaces in Go share none of those restrictions and so are simpler, yet at the same time, are more powerful, and more composable, and critical to the narrative of collaboration, interfaces in Go are satisfied\n\n.\n\nAny Go type, written at any time, in any package, by any programmer, can implement an interface by simply providing the methods necessary to satisfy the interface\u2019s contract.\n\nIt follows logically that small interfaces lead to simple implementations,\u00a0because it is hard to do otherwise. Leading to packages comprised of simple implementations connected by common interfaces.\n\nI\u2019ve written a lot about the subject of Go\u2019s error handling, so I\u2019ll restrict my comments here to errors as they relate to collaboration.\n\nThe error interface is the key to Go\u2019s composable error handling story.\n\nIf you\u2019ve worked on some large Go projects you may have come across packages like Canonical\u2019s errgo, which provide facilities to apply a stack trace to an error value. Perhaps the project has\u00a0rolled their own implementation. Maybe you have developed something similar in house.\n\nI want to be clear that I am remaining neutral on the relative goodness or badness of the idea of gift wrapping errors.\n\nWhat I do want to highlight is even though one piece of code you integrate uses fmt.Errorf, and another a third party package, and in your package you have developed your own error handling type. From the point of view of you the programmer consuming your work, the error handling strategy\n\nlooks the same. If the error is nil, the call worked.\n\nCompare this to the variety of error handling strategies that must be managed in other languages as programs grow through accretion of dependencies.\n\nThis is the key to a Go programmer\u2019s ability to write an application at any size without sacrificing reliability. In the context of collaboration, it must be said that Go\u2019s error handling strategy is the only form that makes sense.\n\nGo\u2019s lack of Makefiles is more than a convenience.\n\nWith other programming languages, when you integrate a piece of third party code, maybe it\u2019s something complex, like v8, or something more mundane, like a database driver from your vendor, you\u2019re integrating that code into your program, this part is obvious, but you are also integrating their build system.\n\nThis is a far less visible, and sometimes far more intractable problem. You\u2019ve not just introduced a dependency on that piece of code, but also a dependency on its build system, be it cmake, scons, gnu autotools, what have you.\n\nGo simply doesn\u2019t have this problem.\n\nPutting aside the contentious issues of package versioning, once you have the source in your $GOPATH, integrating any\u00a0piece of third party Go code into your program is just an import statement.\n\nGo programs are built from just their source, which has everything you need to know to compile a Go program. I think this is a hugely important and equally under-appreciated part of Go\u2019s collaboration story.\n\nThis is also the key to Go\u2019s efficient compilation. The source indicates only those things that it depends on, and nothing else. Compiling your program will touch only the lines of source necessary.\n\nDoes your heart sink when you want to try the hottest new project from Hacker News or Reddit only find it requires node.js, or some assortment of Ruby dependencies that aren\u2019t available on your operating system ? Or you have to look up what is the correct way to install a python package this week. Is it pip, is it easy_install, does that need an egg, or are they wheels ?\n\nI can tell you mine does.\n\nFor Go programmers dependency management remains an open wound, this is a fact, and one that I am not proud of. But for users of programs written in Go their life just got a whole lot easier; compile the program, scp it to the server, job done.\n\nGo\u2019s ability to produce stand alone applications; and even cross compile them directly from your workstation\u00a0means that programmers are rediscovering the lost art of shipping a program, a real compiled program, the exact same one they tested, to customers.\n\nThis one fact alone has allowed Go to establish a commanding position in the container orchestration market, a market which arguably would not exist in its current form if not for Go\u2019s deployment story.\n\nThis story also illustrates how Go\u2019s design decisions move beyond just thinking about how the programmer and the language will interact during the development phase, and extend right through the software life-cycle to the deployment phase.\n\nGo\u2019s choice of a single static binary is directly influenced by Google\u2019s experiences deploying their own large complex applications, and I believe their advice should not be dismissed lightly.\n\nC# isn\u2019t portable, it is joined at the hip to a Windows host.\n\nSwift and Objective-C are in the same boat, they live in the land of Apple only programming languages. Popular ? yes, but portable ? no.\n\nJava, Scala, Groovy, and all the rest of the languages built atop the JVM may benefit from the architecture independence of the JVM bytecode format, until you realize that Oracle is only interested in supporting the JVM on its own hardware.\n\nJava is tone deaf to the requirements of the machine it is executing on. The JVM is too sandboxed, too divorced from the reality of the environment it is working inside.\n\nRuby and Python are better citizens in this regard, but are hamstrung by their clumsy deployment strategies.\n\nIn the new world of metered cloud deployments in which we find ourselves, where you pay by the hour, the difference between a slow interpreted language, and a nimble compiled Go program is stark.\n\nGo\u2019s fresh take on portability, without the requirement to abstract yourself away from the machine your program runs on, is like no other language available today.\n\nFor the last few decades, since the rise of interpreted languages, or virtual machine run-times, programming has been less about writing small targeted tools, and more about managing the complexity of the environment those tools are deployed into.\n\nSlow languages, or bloated deployments encourage programmers to pile additional functionality into one application to amortize the cost of installation and set up.\n\nI believe that we are in the early stage of a command line renaissance, a renaissance driven by the rediscovery of languages which produce compiled, self contained, programs. Go is leading this charge.\n\nA command line renaissance which enables developers to deliver simple programs that fit together, cross platform, in a way that suites the needs of the nascent cloud automation community, and reintroduces a generation of programmers to the art of writing tools which fit together, as Doug McIlroy described, \u201clike segments in a garden hose\u201d.\n\nA key part of the renaissance is Go\u2019s deployment story. I spoke earlier and many of my fellow speakers have praised Go for its pragmatic deployment story, focusing on server side deployments, but I believe there is more to this.\n\nOver the last year we\u2019ve seen a number of companies shift their\n\nside tools from interpreted languages like Ruby and Python to Go. Cloud Foundry\u2019s tools, Github\u2019s hub, and MongoDB\u2019s tool suite are the ones that spring to mind.\n\nIn every case their motivations were similar; while the existing tools worked well, the support load from customers who were not able to get the tool installed correctly on their machine was huge.\n\nGo lets you write command line applications, that in turn enables developers to leverage the UNIX philosophy; small, sharp tools that work well together.\n\nThis is a command line renaissance that has been missing for a generation.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/supermighty/status/548897982016663552\n\nGo is a simple language, this was not an accident.\n\nThis was a deliberate decision, executed brilliantly by experienced designers who struck a chord with pragmatic developers.\n\nPut simply, Go is a language for programmers who want to get things done.\n\n\u201cI just get things done instead of talking about getting them done.\u201d\u00a0\u2014 Henry Rollins\n\nAs Andrew Gerrand noted in his fifth birthday announcement\n\n\u201cGo arrived as the industry underwent a tectonic shift toward cloud computing, and we were thrilled to see it quickly become an important part of that movement.\u201d \u2014 Andrew Gerrand\n\nGo\u2019s success is directly attributable to the factors that motivated its designers. As Rob Pike noted in his 2012 Splash paper.\n\n\u201cGo is a language designed by Google to help solve Google\u2019s problems; and Google has big problems\u201d \u2014 Rob Pike\n\nAnd it turns out that Go\u2019s design choices are applicable to the problems that an increasing number of professional programmers face today.\n\nNovember last year, Go turned 5 years old as a public project.\n\nIn these 5 years, less if you consider that the language only reached 1.0 in April of 2012, Go, as a language, and a proposition to programmers and development teams, has been wildly successful.\n\nIn 2014 there were five international Go conferences. In 2015 there will be\n\n.\n\nLastly, look around this room and see your peers, 350 experienced programmers, who have decided in invest in Go.\n\nThis paper describes the language we have today. A language built with care and moderation. The language is what it is because of deliberate decisions that were made at every step.\n\nLanguage design is about trade-offs, so learn to appreciate the care in which Go\u2019s features were chosen and the skill in which they were combined.\n\nWhile the language strives for simplicity, and is easy to learn, it does not immediately follow that the language is trivial to master.\n\nThere is a lot to love in our language, don\u2019t be in such a hurry to dismiss it before you have explored it fully.\n\nLearn to love the language.\n\nlearn the language. It\u2019ll take longer than you would think.\n\nLearn to appreciate the choices of the designers.\n\nBecause, and I truly mean this, Go will make you a better programmer.\n\nCross compilation is one of Go\u2019s headline features. I\u2019ve written about it a\n\n, and others have taken this work and built\n\naround it.\n\nThis morning Russ Cox committed\n\nwhich resolved the\n\nin making cross compilation simpler and more accessible for all Gophers. When Go 1.5 ships in August any Go programmer will be able to cross compile their program without having to go through a fussy\u00a0set up phase.\n\nIn the current version of Go, (if you\u2019re from the future, read Go 1.4 and earlier) before you could cross compile a Go program, you needed to go through a set up phase to enhance your Go installation with the bits necessary to build for other platforms.\n\nThis worked ok if you had built Go from source, but if you were using one of the binary distributions or something from your operating system (brew, apt, etc), then the process would turn into a maze of twisty passages, all alike.\n\nThis was necessary because for successful cross compilation you would need\n\nWith the plan to translate the\n\ncoming to fruition in the 1.5 release the first issue is now resolved. That just left the small amount of customisation to the runtime done at installation time, which has been whittled away as part of the compiler transition (most of the customisation was generation of include files for the C parts of the runtime), and as of this morning,\n\n.\n\nIf you can\u2019t wait til August, you can try this out today by building the development version of Go.\n\nAs mentioned above to build the development version of Go, you also need Go 1.4 installed to\n\n. Once Go 1.5 comes out this step will be unnecessary.\n\nThese steps are a simple procedure to do this which I would recommend following\n\nNow you have the development version of Go 1.5 installed, cross compiling this simple program is trivial\n\nNow build for darwin/386\n\nOr build for linux/arm\n\nCross compilation can\u2019t get any simpler than that.\n\nSo what is happening under the hood when we compile a program for a different platform ? The\n\nflag gives us a clue.\n\nComparing the two examples above, the first build is using the standard library that was built as part of the Go installation. That is to say, all the packages that\n\nand\n\ndepend on are already built into\n\n.\n\nIn the second example, the\n\ntool detects that all the dependencies of this program need to be built for the target plaform before\n\ncan be compiled and builds them, all the way back to the\n\npackage.\n\nI have not included the output here because it is very verbose, but you can look at all the steps that are being performed if you pass the\n\nflag to\n\n.\n\nCross compilation while linking to libraries via cgo is the holy grail for some. Sadly the changes mentioned above do not change the situation with respect to cgo. In fact you may still need to rebuild your Go installation in the traditional way to pass environment variables like\n\n. Please try it out.\n\nIn case you can\u2019t tell, I\u2019m over the moon about this improvement. Cross compilation is Go\u2019s ace in the hole and Go 1.5 will make it even better.\n\nPlease try it out and if you find issues please let us know on the\n\n."}

Time passes and finally a few bombers struggle back to their base, the crew shaken, but alive, their aircraft riddled with bullet holes.\n\nShocked by their losses, the reaction by Air Force was to order the areas of the air frame wounded by enemy fire be reinforced with additional armor plating to improve the success of future missions.\n\nFortunately for the Allies, a statistician engaged by the British raised the issue that the aircraft that had returned, although battle scared, were hit in places not crucial for flight. In comparison, their missing comrades had not fared so well. Having succumb to enemy fire, the damage their aircraft suffered could not be accounted for.\n\nThus, the statistician argued, the portions of the aircraft which should receive additional armor should the places which\n\nsuffer damage.\u00a0This then is a tale about Selection Bias.\n\nThirty years later, Frederick P Brooks, Jr wrote his seminal work,\n\n. Brooks\u2019 observation that \u201c\n\n\u201d\u00a0has become a rallying cry for the software development industry;\u00a0one which we have had no shortage of opportunities to validate against a steady stream of prominent projects who over promised yet under delivered.\n\nHowever, for all our well founded chortling, I wonder if we are not succumbing to our own selection bias. For all the attempts to throw people at a floundering project is there a percentage of teams that quietly pull it off, meet their audacious schedule and live to code another day ?\n\nIs Brooks\u2019 law an axiom of the software development industry, or are we simply counting the losers and drawing the wrong conclusion?\n\nIf you\u2019re interested in the performance improvements delivered in Go 1.2, I\u2019ve written about it as part of this years Go Advent project.\n\nYou can find the post on the Gopher Academy blog,\n\n."}

It's better than my old one (d15.biz) in my opinion. \"d15\" doesn't have\n\nmuch meaning (apart from people that know it means \"Daniel15\"), whereas \"dan\" is a lot better.

I also got\n\nlast night, but I'm not sure where I'll use that (\"daniel good?\" I dunno). It currently just redirects to dan.cx. I should probably stop buying domains.

I don't really work on MySpaceTools any more, so I'm just letting the domain expire. \ud83d\ude1b\n\nI guess you've probably noticed, but I've been doing some updates to my site (finally!). I rewrote it to use my own very simple CMS \u00a0(instead of a static HTML file), and added a\n\nshowing some of the bigger projects I've worked on in the past. I'm considering switching the site to be fully WordPress (instead of just the blog), but I haven't done that just yet. Not sure if I will, I'm happy with the simple CMS for now. I thought WordPress might be easier for site management though. And the main part of the site is the blog, which might be better in the root. I dunno.\n\nA proper blog post will come eventually. One day. \ud83d\ude03\n\nUntil next time,\n\n\u2014 Daniel\n\nWell, I haven't blogged for a while (seems to happen to me quite often). I was pretty busy with university work, exams, arranging a work placement for next year for IBL, and other stuff. I get my exam results in about one and a half weeks, hopefully I did alright on them. We'll see I guess...\n\nMany of you know about my girlfriend. If not, her name is\n\n, and she's absolutely\n\n\ud83d\ude04. We met online on MySpace (haha) towards the end of September 2008. I had broken up with my ex-girlfriend after a short and hopeless relationship in August 2008. I was rather upset after my ex broke up with me (to be honest, I really have no idea why, looking back at it now), and was just looking for people to talk to, to make me feel better. I was browsing MySpace one of those days, and was looking through\n\n's (you know, the guy with the pretend friends) blog, where Ciera had posted a comment on one of the posts. There was something about her in particular (the way she wrote? Her picture? I really don't know) that made me click on her and take a look at her profile. Now, I don't know\n\nthis happened (even today, neither me nor her know why things happened the way they did), but I'm glad it did. Reading her profile made me realise that we had so much in common! I sent a friend request right away, wondering if she'd accept and become my friend. I really wanted to get to know her more.\n\nLuckily, she accepted my friend request. We started talking on MySpace, and eventually on Windows Live Messenger. We chat for\n\nand hours every day... It made me really happy (still does today), and made me forget about my ex-girlfriend and what happened with her. We kept learning more and more about each other, and got closer and closer. It was amazing how much we have in common! After about a month, we started to realise how we felt about each other. What started as a good friendship was definitely growing into something bigger (bigger is better, right?). There was only one problem with this \u2014 Distance. You see, while I'm here in Australia, she's all the way in the USA. We were so close, and yet physically we were so so far away from each other. Quite annoying really \ud83d\ude26. She told me that when she finds a job, she'd start saving up to come see me!\n\nFast-forward eight months later, to June 2009, and Ciera was on her way here! She had saved up some money for the flight here, and I contributed some money towards it as well. It was so unbelievable, finally getting to be with her. I honestly didn't know what to expect, but I knew things were going to be alright (since me and Ciera were extra-close by this time \ud83d\ude04). And things were\n\nthan just \"alright\" \u2014\u00a0The whole experience was\n\n! We had a great time staying together! She was here for three months, and we did so much in that time! I showed her around some places in Melbourne, and we just generally \u00a0had a great time. Just holding hands and even just being in the same room as each other felt so amazing after dreaming about it for so long. It was really like a dream come true to us. \u00a0It was really upsetting when she had to leave though, and I still miss her all the time \ud83d\ude26. At least now I know who I'm going to spend my life with. It's a great feeling knowing someone as amazing and attractive as Ciera. \ud83d\ude03\n\nBeing in a long-distance relationship has been quite an experience. While it's quite hard and I miss her every day, knowing that she's there for me and we'll be together one day is an amazing thing. I miss her heaps. I miss her smile, her laugh, everything about her. Being able to chat to her every day helps HEAPS though. It makes me feel like she's with me, even though we're physically so far away.\u00a0 A lot of people say that online relationships don't work, but me and Ciera are proving them wrong \ud83d\ude04. I love her more than anyone else I've ever met, and I have a feeling things will be like this forever. We're both working towards seeing each other again, and it'll be amazing. Like I mentioned at the start, I have a work placement next year. If that goes well, I'll save all the money from that, and use it to fly over to see her at the end of the year. That's pretty far away, but it'll be incredible when it happens. It'll be the first time I've travelled outside Australia (outside Victoria, even).\n\nCiera's also\n\non\n\n, if you want to read her one.\n\nUntil next time,\n\n\u2014 Daniel"}

I wanted to do something special, seeing as this year's the first year I've considered buying something for someone \ud83d\ude1b. Apart from that, I haven't been doing all that much. Over the last few weeks, I worked on a few programming projects, then got bored of that and stopped working on them xD. Nothing much apart from that, just the usual chatting on Windows Live Messenger, and browsing Digg, news.com.au, and some other sites.\n\nI go back to university on Monday... Second year of\n\n, should be fun \ud83d\ude03. No usability this semester!

Not another XSS hole, this is a different security hole with some privacy implications.

However, if someone were to do something like that, assuming it's posted anonymously, nothing bad would happen. So, the thing that's the most \"correct\" (reporting it to them) would get punished (as my previous reported security hole showed), whereas the thing that's \"wrong\" (posting it to a security site) wouldn't. Isn't it obvious what most people would do? How funny.\n\n\u2014 Daniel\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI got bored today and thought it might be fun to make a MySpace profile layout that looks like Facebook. Considering I'm not a designer, I'm rather happy with how it turned out. There's a screenshot to the right, click on it to see a full-size version.\n\nI haven't tested in Internet Explorer, but that shouldn't be much of an issue, as most people are using better browsers... Right?\n\nPlease feel free to use this layout on your profile. The only thing I ask is that you keep the credit (Layout by Daniel15) on the page, and in the CSS code itself.\n\nHere's what you need to do if you want to use this layout on your MySpace profile. You should probably already know how to use a MySpace Profile 2.0 layout, but here's a brief overview:\n\nIf you don't like the header, and would prefer the default MySpace one, delete everything between\n\nand\n\nNote I'm giving\n\nfor this layout. I can try to help you with bugs in the layout itself, but can't help you with anything beyond that. Having said that, please feel free to leave a comment if you find any issues with the layout.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\u2014 Daniel\n\nA while back, I reported a security problem to MySpace. Being a nice person, I thought I'd email them and wait for a reply before telling anyone else (I thought I was the only one to find this problem, but it appears a few others knew of it too. I didn't know this until later). I have reported a few problems to MySpace in the past, and they usually took around two weeks or so to reply. Sure, their reply was something generic, but it was a reply at least. Anyways, back to this story. So, after writing to them, I waited two weeks. Didn't hear anything back from them. A month, still didn't hear anything. So I thought that as a month had passed, I may as well report the security hole to a security site. I wrote to xssed.com, and after a small wait they published an article on it.\n\nToday, I try to log in to my account, and it didn't work. Interesting, I was sure I was typing the correct password. I go to use the \"Forgot your password?\", and it says my email is invalid. So that's it, they've\n\n. For me, MySpace was a way to keep in touch with old friends I otherwise wouldn't be able to talk to. And now they've deleted my account. So, they deleted my account for\n\na security issue and showing them a\n\n, yet people that actively try to attack MySpace accounts still have active accounts? This makes no sense, if anything they should be thanking me for finding the bug on their site, and being nice enough not to do anything evil with it. It's totally unfair. Just before deleting the account, I had 467 friends, 1991 comments, 2300 messages, and just over 19000 profile views. I have no clue what's going to happen to my\n\n, an application that now has\n\n.  Whatever, I'm done with MySpace now. I made a new account but don't really care about it any more.

Mainly due to real-life getting in the way. Yeah, real life gets like that sometimes, it's rather annoying \ud83d\ude1b . That, and the fact that I'm lazy - I won't really do anything unless I'm forced to (or force myself to). Well actually, most people are like this, it's just very few seem to admit it. And realisation is the first step to admitting you have a problem, right? \ud83d\ude1b . And I haven't really had anything to blog about either. Aaaand this blog has approximately 0 readers. I don't think anyone is even reading what I'm writing right now. If you're one of the 0 readers, then HELLOOOOOOOO TO YOOOOOOUUUUUU!!! I have a cookie for you, come and get it before I eat it.\n\nWell anyways, enough of my stupid rambling... my first year of University is finally over, and geez did the time pass quickly \ud83d\ude10 !  It was generally enjoyable, way way more so than high school was. University life is completely different to high school, in a sense it's a lot more relaxed. Some people take advantage of this and try to breeze through Uni without studying... And end up dropping out \ud83d\ude1b.  I tried concentrating in class (moreso than last year at high school), but in the end I just ended up not paying attention at all, and rushing all my last assignments (isn't this the case with everyone?). Results day is\n\n, so I guess I'll be worrying about my results until then. There's one... no, wait, two things I really hated though:\n\nOkay, sure, everyone hates exams. Me moreso than most I reckon. I seriously HATE HATE HATE exams. On a scale from 1 to OMG I HATE THIS, it'd be on the very end. Seriously. They drive me crazy. Crazier than I normally am, and that's a LOT. \ud83d\ude2e I seem to often forget everything and have a whole heap of stuff rush back to me at the last minute. I hate it, haha. At least these exams aren't as bad as the\n\n(or maybe Usability is that bad... I'll get to that in a bit)\n\nAnd especially one of my subjects was a subject about website development using HTML. We had to\n\nHTML (yes, by hand) in the exam. Seriously, what is that testing? Most (hell,\n\n) normal web developers always have references handy (HTML for Dummies, Complete All-In-One Website Reference, Garfield comic strips out of their local news paper, whatever), they don't need to know all HTML stuff off the top of their head (and certainly don't need to write it on paper). But this subject was nowhere near as bad as everyone's enemy:\n\nFalling over might be enjoyable. Jumping off a cliff could potentially be enjoyable. But this,\n\n, this subject is not enjoyable at all, it's literally the worst subject. Ever. Well maybe not really, but it's boring. Most of the class was common knowledge (you know, things like \"red writing on a green background looks fugly\", \"make sure users find your software interface easy to use\", and \"don't stab people\"). I'm hoping we don't get more subjects that are as annoying as this one was. If we do, I'm stabbing someone with a red and green paper. An easy-to-use one.\n\nGo-karts? Did someone mention go-karts? Oh yeah, it was an idea I had when I was around 8 years old or so. I had this amazingly awesome (and by \"amazingly awesome\" I mean \"it sounded good at the time\") idea to build a go-kart that goes along the tram lines (anyone not living in Melbourne should look up \"Melbourne Trams\" on Wikipedia to see these mythical \"tram\" thingies I'm talking about). But basically, trams are a form of public transportation here, a form of light rail. The streets have tram lines in the middle of the street, kinda like a train line except it's on the road instead of being separate. Trams have overhead powerlines, which is what gave me this idea. Instead of the go-kart needing petrol or a battery, it could simply use the power the trams are using. Although now I realise several downfalls with this:\n\nSo what else can I say? There's not much really, my life's pretty boring right now. Oh yes, my girlfriend and I broke up, I guess just things weren't working out. So yeah, I'm single again. And no I'm not looking for a girlfriend at the moment, so don't bother asking (unless you like the feeling of being rejected I guess) xD. I guess that made me realise a lot more about myself, who I am and exactly\n\nI'm looking for. I made a special friend that I'm very similar and now extremely close to, it's like we're soulmates or something. She knows who she is, and I'm pretty certain she'd be reading this (maybe she's the one of the 0 readers \ud83d\ude2e ) \ud83d\ude03. As a person I've changed pretty significantly over the past year or so (especially in the last few months), and it really seems like a pretty good thing. But I'll save all of this for another blog post, this one's getting rather long. I should try to blog more about life I guess, it's something I like writing about. If you look through the firsts posts to this blog, they were pretty geeky. Then again, I've become way less geeky (still do programming though), haha \ud83d\ude1b . It all fits in to the whole \"change\" thing.\n\nOh, and for anyone from Australia, the NoCleanFeed protests are on the\n\n(same as Swinburne results day!). For more information take a look at\n\n. The protests in Melbourne are going to be at the state library, and I\n\nbe going, I'm not sure yet. Perhaps you want some\n\n, thanks to my friend Joseph. \ud83d\ude04\n\nWell that's all for now...\n\nOh and btw, the cookie's all gone. Sorry about that.\n\nUntil next time \ud83d\ude03"}
