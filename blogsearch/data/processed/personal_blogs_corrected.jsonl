But I‚Äôm not having a crisis about my personal life choices‚Ä¶ instead I‚Äôm having a crisis of generational impotence. I‚Äôm tired of waiting for my generation‚Äôs turn, which I am less and less convinced will come in time to make a difference, especially since GenZ seems to be going conservative üòë\n\nOuter South by Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band\n\nI finally got letters back from two of my reps:\n\nSenator Murray, 74yo and in office since 1993 when I was in third grade, wants me to know that she ‚Äúremain[s] committed to continuing to work with [her] colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find ways to make progress on immigration reform.‚Äù Thank you for your complacency Senator. I don‚Äôt know how immigration progress will be made with isolationist Nazis tbh üßê I don‚Äôt get why Dems are taking conservative immigration stances when in my mind the problem is we are too strict on immigration, and should let in more people. There, birth rate ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù solved too! What I want to know now is, what are the Senator‚Äôs plans for retirement?\n\nRepresentative DelBene‚Äôs office thinks I ‚Äúmay be pleased to know that [she] joined [her] Democratic colleagues in sending a letter to President Trump expressing serious concern about Mr. Abrego Garcia‚Äôs case and requesting an immediate update on his wellbeing and how the administration plans to ensure his safe return to the United States.‚Äù I am, in fact, not pleased. I am the opposite of pleased. Is she fucking with me? Does she not go on the Internet? In what world am I satisfied that she signed a strongly worded letter and called it good?\n\nMy resentment towards 80yo politicians who won‚Äôt retire and pass their power to the next generation is reaching a rolling boil as the Democrats in charge apparently don‚Äôt have an ounce of urgency left in their moldering bodies. I have to think it‚Äôs intentional, especially given the way Nancy and co blocked Millennial AOC from a position of power in favor of an old dude with cancer who just died from it (‚ÄúGerry‚Äôs a young 74, cancer notwithstanding‚Äù üôÑüôÑüôÑ); I think Boomer politicians know how badly they‚Äôve fucked over everyone younger than them, and they will literally hold power until they die to prevent facing justice. (Yeah I‚Äôm making it generational, they‚Äôve been demonizing Millennials to avoid looking in the mirror for decades.) They booted 25yo David Hogg from DNC leadership as punishment for suggesting the party should not always support incumbents, making a mockery of DEI principles by using gender equality rules to invalidate his election.\n\nA friend and I just looked it up: Nancy Pelosi was first elected in 1987. She has been in power for basically my entire life. And I am turning 40. Her legacy, in my mind? Losing women the right to bodily autonomy, for not taking Republicans seriously and doing anything about it when she could have. OK fine she did get us the ACA. Thanks lady. But it‚Äôs time to go home, get some rest, and let someone else have a turn! (Sorry Bernie, I love ya man, but you too!!!)\n\nI think those in charge should have some stakes in the game. If you‚Äôre already past the actuarial tables, you shouldn‚Äôt get to make decisions for the rest of us who are going to live in the world our politicians make for potentially decades. (I expect the Supreme Court will be ultra conservative for the rest of my life because Dems wouldn‚Äôt dare trying to expand it.) Be a mentor, yes, please! But give up the power. Normal retirement age is 67. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ageist to suggest it might be time for someone two decades past retirement age to pass the torch.\n\nGive me a party with energy, give me politicians who fight! Oh, for an opposition party ü•∫ I don‚Äôt have to agree 100% with them, if they‚Äôd just have some gumption. Give me AOC energy, Shawn Fain energy, Pete Buttigieg (!) energy, Cory Booker energy, Chris Van Hollen energy, Kat Abughazaleh energy. Not whatever this pathetic excuse for ‚Äúleadership‚Äù is. Walz had the energy and they told him to stuff it. Brilliant strategy guys.\n\nPlease, please tell me someone is primarying all my Federal reps next election, because I will vote for anyone who shows some semblance of spine üò°", "label": "personal"}
{"title": "LiteRT: Maximum performance, simplified", "url": "https://developers.googleblog.com/en/litert-maximum-performance-simplified/", "content": "Over the past decade, mobile phones have incorporated increasingly powerful purpose-specific accelerators including GPUs and recently, more powerful NPUs (Neural Processing Units). By accelerating your AI models on mobile GPUs and NPUs, you can speed up your models by up to 25x compared to CPU while also reducing power consumption by up to 5x. However, unlocking these outstanding performance benefits has proven challenging for most developers, as it requires wrangling HW-specific APIs in case of GPU inference or wrangling vendor-specific SDKs, formats, and runtimes for NPU inference. Listening to your feedback, the Google AI Edge team is excited to announce multiple improvements to LiteRT solving the challenges above, and accelerating AI on mobile more easily with increased performance. Our new release includes a new LiteRT API making on-device ML inference easier than ever, our latest cutting-edge GPU acceleration, new NPU support co-developed with MediaTek and Qualcomm (open for early access), and advanced inference features to maximize performance for on-device applications. Let‚Äôs dive in!\n\nMLDrift: Best GPU Acceleration Yet GPUs have always been at the heart of LiteRT‚Äôs acceleration story, providing the broadest support and most consistent performance improvement. MLDrift, our latest version of GPU acceleration, pushes the bar even further with faster performance and improvements to support models of a significantly larger size through: Smarter Data Organization: MLDrift arranges data in a more efficient way by using optimized tensor layouts and storage types specifically tailored for how GPUs process data, reducing memory access time and speeding up AI calculations. Workgroup Optimization: Smart computation based on context (stage) and resource constraints Improved Data Handling: Streamlining the way the accelerator receives and sends out tensor data to reduce overhead in data transfer and conversion optimizing for data locality.\n\nThis results in significantly faster performance than CPUs, than previous versions of our TFLite GPU delegate, and even other GPU enabled frameworks particularly for CNN and Transformer models.\n\nFigure: Inference latency per model of LiteRT GPU compared to TFLite GPU, measured on Samsung 24.\n\nFind examples in our documentation and give GPU acceleration a try today.\n\nMediaTek and Qualcomm NPU Support NPUs, AI specific accelerators, are becoming increasingly common in flagship phones. They allow you to run AI models much more efficiently, and in many cases much faster. In our internal testing compared to CPUs this acceleration can be up to 25x faster, and 5x more power efficient. (May 2025, based on internal testing) Typically, each vendor provides their own SDKs, including compilers, runtime, and other dependencies, to compile and execute models on their SoCs. The SDK must precisely match the specific SoC version and requires proper download and installation. LiteRT now provides a uniform way to develop and deploy models on NPUs, abstracting away all these complexities. Vendor compiler distribution: When installing the LiteRT PyPI package, we will automatically download the vendor SDKs for compiling models. Model and vendor runtime distribution: The compiled model and SoC runtime will need to be distributed with the app. As a developer you can handle this distribution yourself, or you can have Google Play distribute them for you. In our example code you can see how to use AI Packs and Feature Delivery to deliver the right model and runtime to the right device.\n\nWe‚Äôre excited to partner with MediaTek and Qualcomm to allow developers to accelerate a wide variety of classic ML models, such as vision, audio, and NLP models, on MediaTek and Qualcomm NPUs. Increased model and domain support will continue over the coming year. This feature is available in private preview. For early access apply here.\n\nSimplified GPU and NPU Hardware Acceleration We‚Äôve made GPUs and NPUs easier than ever to use by simplifying the process in the latest version of the LiteRT APIs. With the latest changes, we have simplified the setup significantly with the ability to specify the target backend as an option. As an example, this is how a developer would specify GPU acceleration:\n\n// 1. Load model. auto model = *Model::Load(\"mymodel.tflite\"); // 2. Create a compiled model targeting GPU. auto compiled_model = *CompiledModel::Create(model, kLiteRtHwAcceleratorGpu); C++ Copied\n\nAs you can see, the new CompiledModel API greatly simplifies how to specify the model and target backend(s) for acceleration.\n\nAdvanced Inference for Performance Optimization While using high performance backends is helpful, optimal performance of your application can be hindered by memory, or processor bottlenecks. With the new LiteRT APIs, you can address these challenges by leveraging built-in buffer interoperability to eliminate costly memory copy operations, and asynchronous execution to utilize idle processors in parallel.\n\nSeamless Buffer Interoperability The new TensorBuffer API provides an efficient way to handle input/output data with LiteRT. It allows you to directly use data residing in hardware memory, such as OpenGL Buffers, as inputs or outputs for your CompiledModel, completely eliminating the need for costly CPU copies.\n\nauto tensor_buffer = *litert::TensorBuffer::CreateFromGlBuffer(tensor_type, opengl_buffer); C++ Copied\n\nThis significantly reduces unnecessary CPU overhead and boosts performance.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the TensorBuffer API enables seamless copy-free conversions between different hardware memory types when supported by the system. Imagine effortlessly transforming data from an OpenGL Buffer to an OpenCL Buffer or even to an Android HardwareBuffer without any intermediate CPU transfers. This technique is key to handling the increasing data volumes and demanding performance required by increasingly complex AI models. You can find examples in our documentation on how to use TensorBuffer.\n\nAsynchronous Execution Asynchronous execution allows different parts of the AI model or independent tasks to run concurrently across CPU, GPU, and NPUs allowing you to opportunistically leverage available compute cycles from different processors to improve efficiency and responsiveness. For instance: the CPU might handle data preprocessing the GPU could accelerate matrix multiplications in a neural network layer, and the NPU might efficiently manage specific inference tasks ‚Äì all happening in parallel.\n\nIn applications which require real-time AI interactions, a task can be initiated on one processor and continue with other operations on another. Parallel processing minimizes latency and provides a smoother, more interactive user experience. By effectively managing and overlapping computations across multiple processors, asynchronous execution maximizes system throughput and ensures that the AI application remains fluid and reactive, even under heavy computational loads. Async execution is implemented by using OS-level mechanisms (e.g., sync fences on Android/Linux) allowing one HW accelerator to trigger upon the completion of another HW accelerator directly without involving the CPU. This reduces latency (up to 2x in our GPU async demo) and power consumption while making the pipeline more deterministic. Here is the code snippet showing async inference with OpenGL buffer input:\n\n// Create an input TensorBuffer based on tensor_type that wraps the given OpenGL // Buffer. env is an LiteRT environment to use existing EGL display and context. auto tensor_buffer_from_opengl = *litert::TensorBuffer::CreateFromGlBuffer(env, tensor_type, opengl_buffer); // Create an input event and attach it to the input buffer. Internally, it // creates and inserts a fence sync object into the current EGL command queue. auto input_event = *Event::CreateManaged(env, LiteRtEventTypeEglSyncFence); tensor_buffer_from_opengl.SetEvent(std::move(input_event)); // Create the input and output TensorBuffers‚Ä¶ // Run async inference compiled_model1.RunAsync(input_buffers, output_buffers); C++ Copied", "label": "personal"}

Intrigued by the limits of generative artificial intelligence (AI), he had asked ChatGPT to give him the names of the 12 novels he had written. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve only written nine,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAlways eager to please, it decided to invent three.‚Äù The ‚Äúnine inches‚Äù from the fake title it hallucinated was stolen from a filthy Robert Burns poem. ‚ÄúI just distrust these systems when it comes to truth,‚Äù says Morrison. He is yet to write Nine Inches ‚Äì ‚Äúor its sequel, Eighteen Inches‚Äù, he laughs. His actual latest book, For Emma, imagining AI brain-implant chips, is about the human costs of technology.\n\nMorrison keeps an eye on the machines, such as OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT, and their capabilities, but he refuses to use them in his own life and work. He is one of a growing number of people who are actively resisting: people who are terrified of the power of generative AI and its potential for harm and don‚Äôt want to feed the beast; those who have just decided that it‚Äôs a bit rubbish, and more trouble than it‚Äôs worth; and those who simply prefer humans to robots.\n\nGo online, and it‚Äôs easy to find AI proponents who dismiss refuseniks as ignorant luddites ‚Äì or worse, smug hipsters. I possibly fall into both camps, given that I have decidedly Amish interests (board games, gardening, animal husbandry) and write for the Guardian. Friends swear by ChatGPT for parenting advice, and I know someone who uses it all day for work in her consultancy business, but I haven‚Äôt used it since playing around after it launched in 2022. Admittedly ChatGPT might have done a better job, but this piece was handcrafted using organic words from my artisanal writing studio. (OK, I mean bed.) I could have assumed my interviewees‚Äô thoughts from plundering their social media posts and research papers, as ChatGPT would have done, but it was far more enjoyable to pick up the phone and talk, human to human. Two of my interviewees were interrupted by their pets, and each made me laugh in some way (full disclosure: AI then transcribed the noise).\n\nView image in fullscreen Ewan Morrison: ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a product of venture capital gone nuts‚Äô Photograph: Roberto Ricciuti/Getty Images\n\nOn X, where Morrison sometimes clashes with AI enthusiasts, a common insult is ‚Äúdecel‚Äù (decelerationist), but it makes him laugh when people think he‚Äôs the one who isn‚Äôt keeping up. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing [that stops] accelerationism more than failure to deliver on what you promised. Hitting a brick wall is a good way to decelerate,‚Äù he says. One recent study found that AI answered more than 60% of queries inaccurately.\n\nMorrison was drawn into the argument by what he would now call ‚Äúalarmist fears about the potential for superintelligence and runaway AI. The more I‚Äôve got into it, the more I realise that‚Äôs a fiction that‚Äôs been dangled before the investors of the world, so they‚Äôll invest billions ‚Äì in fact, half a trillion ‚Äì into this quest for artificial superintelligence. It‚Äôs a fantasy, a product of venture capital gone nuts.‚Äù\n\nThere are also copyright violations ‚Äì generative AI is trained on existing material ‚Äì that threaten him as a writer, and his wife, screenwriter Emily Ballou. In the entertainment industry, he says, people are using ‚ÄúAI algorithms to determine what projects get the go-ahead, and that means we‚Äôre stuck remaking the past. The algorithms say ‚ÄòMore of the same‚Äô, because it‚Äôs all they can do.‚Äù\n\nI read because I want to understand how somebody sees the world. There‚Äôs no ‚Äòsomebody‚Äô in the synthetic text-extruding machines\n\nMorrison says he has a long list of complaints. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been stacking up over the past few years.‚Äù He is concerned about the job losses (Bill Gates recently predicted AI would lead to a two-day work week). Then there are ‚Äútech addiction, the ecological impact, the damage to the education system ‚Äì 92% of students are now using AI‚Äù. He worries about the way tech companies spy on us to make AI personalised, and is horrified at AI-enabled weapons being used in Ukraine. ‚ÄúI find that ethically revolting.‚Äù\n\nOthers cite similar reasons for not using AI. April Doty, an audiobook narrator, is appalled at the environmental cost ‚Äì the computational power required to perform an AI search and answer is huge. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm infuriated that you can‚Äôt turn off the AI overviews in Google search,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWhenever you look anything up now you‚Äôre basically torching the planet.‚Äù She has started to use other search engines. ‚ÄúBut, more and more, we‚Äôre surrounded by it, and there‚Äôs no off switch. That makes me angry.‚Äù Where she still can, she says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm opting out of using AI.‚Äù\n\nView image in fullscreen Illustration: Kaan Illustration/The Guardian\n\nIn her own field, she is concerned about the number of books that are being ‚Äúread‚Äù by machines. Audible, the Amazon-owned audiobook provider, has just announced it will allow publishers to create audiobooks using its AI technology. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know anybody who wants a robot to read them a story, but I am concerned that it is going to ruin the experience to the point where people don‚Äôt want to subscribe to audiobook platforms any more,‚Äù says Doty. She hasn‚Äôt lost jobs to AI yet but other colleagues have, and chances are, it will happen. AI models can‚Äôt ‚Äúnarrate‚Äù, she says. ‚ÄúNarrators don‚Äôt just read words; they sense and express the feelings beneath the words. AI can never do this job because it requires decades of experience in being a human being.‚Äù\n\nEmily M Bender, professor of linguistics at the University of Washington and co-author of a new book, The AI Con, has many reasons why she doesn‚Äôt want to use large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. ‚ÄúBut maybe the first one is that I‚Äôm not interested in reading something that nobody wrote,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI read because I want to understand how somebody sees something, and there‚Äôs no ‚Äòsomebody‚Äô inside the synthetic text-extruding machines.‚Äù It‚Äôs just a papier-mache made from lots of different people‚Äôs words, she says.\n\nDoes she feel she is being ‚Äúleft behind‚Äù, as AI enthusiasts would say? ‚ÄúNo, not at all. My reaction to that is, ‚ÄòWhere‚Äôs everybody going?‚Äô‚Äù She laughs as if to say: nowhere good.\n\n‚ÄúWhen we turn to synthetic media rather than authentic media, we are losing out on human connection,‚Äù says Bender. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs both at a personal level ‚Äì what we get out of connecting to other people ‚Äì and in terms of strength of community.‚Äù She cites Chris Gilliard, the surveillance and privacy researcher. ‚ÄúHe made the very important point that you can see this as a technological move by the companies to isolate us from each other, and to set things up so that all of our interactions are mediated through their products. We don‚Äôt need that, for us or our communities.‚Äù\n\nDespite Bender‚Äôs well-publicised position ‚Äì she has long been a high-profile critic of LLMs ‚Äì incredibly, she has seen students turn in AI-generated work. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs very sad.‚Äù She doesn‚Äôt want to be policing, or even blaming, students. ‚ÄúMy job is to make sure students understand why it is that turning to a large language model is depriving themselves of a learning opportunity, in terms of what they would get out of doing the work.‚Äù\n\nDoes she think people should boycott generative AI? ‚ÄúBoycott suggests organised political action, and sure, why not?‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI also think that people are individually better off if they don‚Äôt use them.‚Äù\n\nI almost feel I have no choice but to use AI at this point. I might have to put morals aside\n\nSome people have so far held out, but are reluctantly realising they may end up using it. Tom, who works in IT for the government, doesn‚Äôt use AI in his tech work, but found colleagues were using it in other ways. Promotion is partly decided on annual appraisals they have to write, and he had asked a manager whose appraisal had impressed him how he‚Äôd done it, thinking he‚Äôd spent days on it. ‚ÄúHe said, ‚ÄòI just spent 10 minutes ‚Äì I used ChatGPT,‚Äô‚Äù Tom recalls. ‚ÄúHe suggested I should do the same, which I don‚Äôt agree with. I made that point, and he said, ‚ÄòWell, you‚Äôre probably not going to get anywhere unless you do.‚Äô‚Äù Using AI would feel like cheating, but Tom worries refusing to do so now puts him at a disadvantage. ‚ÄúI almost feel like I have no choice but to use it at this point. I might have to put morals aside.‚Äù\n\nOthers, despite their misgivings, limit how they use it, and only for specific tasks. Steve Royle, professor of cell biology at the University of Warwick, uses ChatGPT for the ‚Äúgrunt work‚Äù of writing computer code to analyse data. ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs really the limit. I don‚Äôt want it to generate code from scratch. When you let it do that, you spend way more time debugging it afterwards. My view is, it‚Äôs a waste of time if you let it try and do too much for you.‚Äù Accurate or not, he also worries that if he becomes too reliant on AI, his coding skills will atrophy. ‚ÄúThe AI enthusiasts say, ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt worry, eventually nobody will need to know anything.‚Äô I don‚Äôt subscribe to that.‚Äù\n\nView image in fullscreen Justine Bateman: ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs one of the worst ideas society has ever come up with‚Äô Photograph: NBC/Nathan Congleton/Getty Images\n\nPart of his job is to write research papers and grant proposals. ‚ÄúI absolutely will not use it for generating any text,‚Äù says Royle. ‚ÄúFor me, in the process of writing, you formulate your ideas, and by rewriting and editing, it really crystallises what you want to say. Having a machine do that is not what it‚Äôs about.‚Äù\n\nGenerative AI, says film-maker and writer Justine Bateman, ‚Äúis one of the worst ideas society has ever come up with‚Äù. She says she despises how it incapacitates us. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre trying to convince people they can‚Äôt do the things they‚Äôve been doing easily for years ‚Äì to write emails, to write a presentation. Your daughter wants you to make up a bedtime story about puppies ‚Äì to write that for you.‚Äù We will get to the point, she says with a grim laugh, ‚Äúthat you will essentially become just a skin bag of organs and bones, nothing else. You won‚Äôt know anything and you will be told repeatedly that you can‚Äôt do it, which is the opposite of what life has to offer. Capitulating all kinds of decisions like where to go on vacation, what to wear today, who to date, what to eat. People are already doing this. You won‚Äôt have to process grief, because you‚Äôll have uploaded photos and voice messages from your mother who just died, and then she can talk to you via AI video call every day. One of the ways it‚Äôs going to destroy humans, long before there‚Äôs a nuclear disaster, is going to be the emotional hollowing-out of people.‚Äù\n\nWe keep moving like zombies towards a world that nobody really wants to live in\n\nShe is not interested. ‚ÄúIt is the complete opposite direction of where I‚Äôm going as a film-maker and author. Generative AI is like a blender ‚Äì you put in millions of examples of the type of thing you want and it will give you a Frankenstein spoonful of it.‚Äù It‚Äôs theft, she says, and regurgitation. ‚ÄúNothing original will come out of it, by the nature of what it is. Anyone who uses generative AI, who thinks they‚Äôre an artist, is stopping their creativity.‚Äù\n\nSome studios, such as the animation company Studio Ghibli, have sworn off using AI, but others appear to be salivating at the prospect. In 2023, Dreamworks founder Jeffrey Katzenberg said AI would cut the costs of its animated films by 90%. Bateman thinks audiences will tire of AI-created content. ‚ÄúHuman beings will react to this in the way they react to junk food,‚Äù she says. Deliciously artificial to some, if not nourishing ‚Äì but many of us will turn off. Last year she set up an organisation, Credo 23, and a film festival, to showcase films made without AI. She likens it to an ‚Äúorganic stamp for films, that tells the audience no AI was used.‚Äù People, she says, will ‚Äúhunger for something raw, real and human‚Äù.\n\nIn everyday life, Bateman is trying ‚Äúto be in a parallel universe, where I‚Äôm trying to avoid [AI] as much as possible.‚Äù It‚Äôs not that she is anti-tech, she stresses. ‚ÄúI have a computer science degree, I love tech. I love salt, too, but I don‚Äôt put it on everything.‚Äù\n\nIn fact, everyone I speak to is a technophile in some way. Doty describes herself as ‚Äúvery tech-forward‚Äù, but she adds that she values human connection, which AI is threatening. ‚ÄúWe keep moving like zombies towards a world that nobody really wants to live in.‚Äù Royle codes and runs servers, but also describes himself as a ‚Äúconscientious AI objector‚Äù. Bender specialises in computational linguistics and was named by Time as one of the top 100 people in AI in 2023. ‚ÄúI am a technologist,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúbut I believe that technology should be built by communities for their own purposes, rather than by large corporations for theirs.‚Äù She also adds, with a laugh: ‚ÄúThe Luddites were awesome! I would wear that badge with pride.‚Äù Morrison, too, says: ‚ÄúI quite like the Luddites ‚Äì people standing up to protect the jobs that keep their families and their communities alive.‚Äù", "label": "personal"}

{"title": "Electrifying my house: the first year with a heat pump ‚Äì Tracy Durnell's Mind Garden", "url": "https://tracydurnell.com/2024/01/28/electrifying-my-house-the-first-year-with-a-heat-pump/", "content": "A year ago, we had our gas furnace and water heater replaced with a heat pump and electric water heater. They both really needed replacing. We‚Äôd hoped to have it done before the winter started since our furnace had already been on the fritz for several years ‚Äî but the equipment was on backorder.\n\nMy energy utility, Puget Sound Energy (PSE), wants people to stay on gas, so there weren‚Äôt incentives from them for this switch; however, my city developed a bulk purchase and incentive program to assist homeowners in transitioning to support the community‚Äôs climate goals. This upgrade electrified our whole house, so we could shut off our gas service!*\n\nNow that I‚Äôve had a heat pump for a year, I wanted to share my experience, because I had questions and misconceptions that I didn‚Äôt get answered beforehand. Tl;dr it‚Äôs great, especially the cooling, just works a little differently.\n\n(Heads-up: 2500 word post, but it‚Äôs got graphs! ü§©)\n\n*Technically we still have a gas fireplace installed, but we never used it. PSE said it was safe to simply turn off even if that means there might be a small amount of gas remaining in the pipes under the house.\n\nWhy we got a heat pump\n\nOur old setup was failing\n\nBefore the upgrade, we had a ~20 year old gas furnace and an old gas water heater. In November 2019, a pipe on our water heater ruptured, spraying a ton of scalding water into our garage ceiling, filling the entire garage with steam that we had to hire a company to install fans for days to dry out. After that, the furnace began to fail regularly, falsely tripping the safety shut-off and needing to be restarted multiple times a day. We had people out to fix it multiple times, but the most they could figure was that something inside was corroded and they‚Äôd clean it to buy us another few months.\n\nMy husband‚Äôs telecommuted for years, and during the pandemic, I started working from home too ‚Äî but the only ‚Äúcooling‚Äù we had was a ceiling fan in our living room and dining room. We bought a used portable electric window A/C unit to keep my husband‚Äôs office from turning into an inferno, and hefted it down the hall to our bedroom in the evenings. Less than ideal.\n\nNatural gas is terrible for the planet and for people\n\n‚ÄúNatural gas‚Äù is the greenwashed industry name for methane, an extremely potent greenhouse gas. A lot of methane is fracked, which may have impacts on the health of surrounding communities. Methane is piped, often through First Nation people‚Äôs lands without permission ‚Äî think Keystone XL and Canada‚Äôs Coastal GasLink pipeline ‚Äî where it may leak and harm the water and ecosystem. Also, some methane leaks during fracking and distribution, contributing to emissions.\n\nMoreover, ‚Äúnatural gas‚Äù is propped up by corporate propaganda that cooking with gas is better than electric, despite the atrocious impact methane has on indoor air quality and its contribution to household emissions. I have an electric stove, so I didn‚Äôt have to replace mine in order to get off gas.\n\nWithout gas-burning appliances, our risk of carbon monoxide poisoning is lowered; it would come from some other source, like operating a propane stove indoors (DO NOT DO THAT THING). My husband knows someone who has brain damage from carbon monoxide poisoning!\n\nBasically, ‚Äúnatural gas‚Äù is fucking shit and I want fucking nothing to do with it.\n\nMy new all-electric home energy setup\n\nMy house is about 1400s.f. and has two stories. It was built in the 1980s and our attic doesn‚Äôt have enough insulation (we‚Äôve replaced insulation in the basement but not yet dealt with the attic).\n\nMitsubishi heat pump air handler (SVZ-KP24NA) ‚Äî 24,000 BTU/hour\n\nGeneral Aire residential whole-house air cleaner (GFI #4422 or 4424)\n\nMitsubishi wall head (split-type air conditioner MSZ-GL15NA) ‚Äî one unit installed on second floor ‚Äî we considered a second but decided to save $$$\n\n\n\n50-gallon electric water heater ‚Äî the installer recommended against tankless despite what I‚Äôd read online ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\n18-panel / 5.04kW solar system (Itek IT280 photovoltaic modules and Itek Theia HE‚Äêt UL 3.8 kW inverter) ‚Äî installed in 2015\n\nThe air handler connects to our existing duct system. There‚Äôs the outdoor unit, which we placed on the side of the house directly below the upstairs heat pump head, and there‚Äôs also the air cleaner in the garage where the old furnace was.\n\nThe city bulk purchase program we went through offered Mitsubishi heat pumps, and we just went with what the contractor recommended.\n\nHow much did the heat pump and electric water heater cost?\n\nI am located in the Seattle area, which has been in a housing boom for a while so contractors are pretty expensive.\n\nThe heat pump cost $19,445 + 10.2% tax for equipment and installation. The permit cost $236.*\n\nThe electric water heater with new dedicated 220v circuit cost $2,145 + 10.2% tax.\n\nOur city provided a $500 incentive and coordinated a $1,200 discount for bulk purchase of equipment, so in total we paid $22,155 for both heat pump and new water heater.\n\n*The permit included an inspection, which failed the first time ‚Äî we wouldn‚Äôt have known what wasn‚Äôt installed quite right, so thanks inspector! He was super helpful and pointed out some other unrelated things he noticed that we might consider acting on.\n\nHeat pump vs. gas furnace energy use comparisons\n\nMy situation will not be directly comparable to most people‚Äôs because we have a solar array, but hopefully will still provide a relative comparison. I have provided the electricity we used, which includes power we generated and used directly, but not power we generated and sold back to PSE.\n\nUnfortunately since we upgraded the water heater at the same time, we can‚Äôt isolate only the cost of the heat pump ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nObnoxiously, our power bill comes mid-month. To make life easier for myself in the graphs, I‚Äôve represented the month the bill was issued. That typically covers usage from the 18th of the previous month through the 17th of the billing month üòï\n\nContext: weather and energy trends in the Pacific Northwest\n\nFor usage context, in the Seattle area, it‚Äôs relatively cool (and we run heating) from mid September through early June. Summer is usually relatively moderate, typically peaking with one or two weeks in the 90s (F). Over 100F is unusual.\n\nHow much more electricity did the heat pump use?\n\nThese data represent solely our electricity use, so you can guesstimate how much electricity we use for heating (and cooling) by how much our electricity increased after January 2023. During the cold months (December through March bills), we used about 1200-1500 additional kWh (for heating our space and water). Over the whole year, we used an additional 7300kWh compared to the previous year. (According to PSE, it‚Äôs typical to use about 2800kWh annually for an electric water heater and 6800kWh for a heat pump, or 9600kWh annually.)\n\nYou‚Äôll see that we had a big jump in electricity use in January 2024 (technically mid December through mid January). This coincides with an extremely cold snap for Washington, with temperatures in the ~19 degree Fahrenheit range for about a week. We didn‚Äôt adjust our thermostat during that time period, but did run the heat pump head overnight as well as pulled out a small standalone electric space heater to help keep the house warmer during the day.\n\nMonthly kWh electricity used, Sept. 16 2021-Jan. 17, 2024 Month 2021 2022 2023 2024 kWh difference\n\nwith heat pump 1 499 495 1946 1451 2 419 *1044 *625 3 545 1737 1192 4 681 1617 936 5 695 1120 425 6 531 993 462 7 1003 1213 210 8 1212 1059 -153 9 868 973 105 10 577 721 880 159 11 466 541 1274 733 12 430 500 1651 1151\n\nbold = electric only ‚Äî heat pump installed January 30, 2023\n\n* About half the February 2023 billing cycle was on gas heat\n\n\n\nHow much methane usage did we eliminate?\n\nIn 2022, we used 770 therms of methane.* Now, we use none! üôå\n\n*According to PSE, a typical house uses 690 therms for a gas furnace and 160 therms for a gas water heater, or 850 therms annually.\n\nComparing gas therms and kWh electricity\n\nA therm is equal to approximately 29 kWh. Unless I‚Äôm being totally unreasonable in converting and combining these values, here‚Äôs how the overall kWh shakes out ‚Äî a massive reduction in energy used with the heat pump (Feb 2023-Jan 2024):\n\nHow much did it cost to run the heat pump versus the gas furnace?\n\nThe first month we used the heat pump for cooling, I was braced for a radical energy bill, but thanks to our solar panels, we continued to pay the minimum electrical charge in summer ü¶æ\n\nIn actual costs, we paid $1435 for energy (gas and electricity) in 2022 and $1158 in 2023 (heat pump only); if we assumed that the four summer months of 2022 were $7.95 as in a normal year, that would still put 2022 at $1215. And if we swapped in this year‚Äôs all-electric January bill for last year‚Äôs gas-heated bill, that‚Äôs basically a wash. And now we have whole-house cooling in summer üòé\n\nMonthly energy bill by year, Sept. 16 2021-Jan. 17, 2024 Month 2021 2022 2023 2024 1 $218.41 *$229.79 $260.96 2 $158.67 $202.26 3 $148.30 $188.41 4 $108.26 $91.73 5 $79.85 $28.09 6 $51.67 $7.95 7 *$36.18 $7.95 8 *$76.16 $7.95 9 *$86.90 $7.95 10 $71.32 *$84.62 $46.02 11 $101.87 *$161.19 $136.05 12 $143.28 *$224.62 $204.68\n\nbold = electric only ‚Äî heat pump installed January 30, 2023\n\n* = our solar inverter was not selling electricity back to PSE these months, though was generating power for pass-through usage ‚Äî in a normal year the summer month costs would be the minimum $7.95 ‚Äî this also means there was no bank to draw from for those fall and winter months\n\nWhat I wish we‚Äôd known before switching to a heat pump\n\nIt heats differently than a gas furnace: slow and steady versus bursts of heat\n\nThe first month we had our heat pump, in the cold of February 2023, I was convinced it was broken or we‚Äôd been sold too small of a unit. If you go in with expectations that it‚Äôs going to be a different heating experience than a gas furnace, you‚Äôll be happier than I was at first üòâ\n\nBeing used to a gas furnace, we were used to saying, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cold!‚Äù and bumping the thermostat* up a couple degrees, then getting the immediate feedback of a big blast of hot air and a relatively quick increase in temperature.\n\nIn contrast, the heat pump blows air lightly all day long**. If we increase the thermostat setting, it will take several hours to reach the new temperature. Likewise, when it‚Äôs too cold out, sometimes it has a hard time keeping up. (I‚Äôm hoping that upping our attic insulation will help hold the temperature better.)\n\n*We had a Nest before, but I don‚Äôt think it actually helped save energy since we were home all day every day, so between that and Google‚Äôs creepy surveillance I was fine when I found out the heat pump came with a thermostat and wouldn‚Äôt work with the Nest. Unfortunately, the included thermostat is kind of annoying to program.\n\n**Because heat pumps blow constantly, the contractor recommended keeping as many vents open as possible ‚Äî closing no more than one or two. (There was a technical reason for this that I forget, something about making part of the heat pump get too cold and shut down.) Unfortunately, whoever installed our original HVAC system was, er, clearly the low bidder, so we have wacky vents directly underneath windows and doors all over the house ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è The register that blows the hottest is our downstairs bathroom üôÑ\n\nSo, with the heat pump, we don‚Äôt drop the temperature overnight as much as we did with the gas furnace. We keep the house a more consistent temperature all the time. Then, the poor heat pump isn‚Äôt always struggling to keep up, it just holds what it‚Äôs got.\n\nThe heads aren‚Äôt as quiet as they‚Äôre made out to be\n\nWhoever says they‚Äôre basically silent hasn‚Äôt paid much attention. The heat pump head (which is in our bedroom) makes mysterious noises pretty often, particularly when in heating mode*. My poor cat Mina stares at it, transfixed in horror, as it tinkles like broken glass going through the wash, whooshes like the house is blasting off, brrrs to life unexpectedly, and whirs as the louvers rotate up and down randomly. It sometimes makes noise even when the unit is turned off, which is confusing.\n\nThe fan noises are relatively quiet, especially in comparison with a window AC unit, so that‚Äôs probably the frame of reference people have when they talk about it being silent. But it‚Äôs not silent if you‚Äôre changing from forced air, which actually is basically silent üòâ Overall, it‚Äôs not too intrusive and totally worth it for being able to fine-tune the comfort level of our bedroom, but not quite what I had anticipated.\n\n*I am pretty sensitive to noise, but my husband and cats agree on this one üòâ\n\nOur verdict: the heat pump is a huge win for summer, good for winter\n\nIt kicks ass in summer\n\nWow, after previously not having cooling in summer, it was incredible to be able to comfortably use my office after like 3pm in the summer üòÇ I was especially the beneficiary because in the past my husband got the portable A/C unit since his office was hotter.\n\nThe heat pump couldn‚Äôt keep up with the hottest days in the high nineties, but even then still kept the house in comfortable mid to high eighties ‚Äî totally fine for us, especially with a ceiling fan.\n\nGood in normal cold, fine in cold cold\n\nOnce we learned how to program the thermostat appropriately, we‚Äôve been happy with how the heat pump keeps the house warm.\n\nI‚Äôll be honest: this thing struggles with the cold cold (below freezing). From my understanding, actually cold places use a backup furnace IIRC, but the temperature‚Äôs generally moderate enough in Seattle that we get by with just a heat pump and suck it up for the one or two extra-cold weeks a year.\n\nDuring our recent cold snap, when it was 16 degrees Fahrenheit overnight one night, the house was 55 degrees when we went downstairs in the morning despite the thermostat being set to 68. It didn‚Äôt heat up much during the morning, so we pulled out our little electric space heater and an electric heating pad to boost the warmth, and bundled up with down vests and blankets. This is where the heat pump head is key: we were able to keep our bedroom, where the head is located, comfortable overnight (though we did add extra blankets).\n\nAnd honestly? The heat pump‚Äôs so much more efficient, better for the climate, and safer for us that wearing a jacket for a week or two in the winter seems like a totally reasonable tradeoff.", "label": "personal"}

{"title": "Creating rituals: remembering Coach Taylor ‚Äì Tracy Durnell's Mind Garden", "url": "https://tracydurnell.com/2024/08/16/creating-rituals-remembering-coach-taylor/", "content": "My high school track and cross country coach Mr. Taylor was a master at creating rituals and culture. A former seminary student who was obsessed with ancient Greece, he started each practice with a philosophy discussion. He wove in, too, tales of past runners and triumphs ‚Äî he‚Äôd been coach for nearly thirty years already ‚Äî creating our own pantheon of heroes, the team‚Äôs own mythos. Who of us would one day join its ranks?\n\nMr. Taylor recognized how much the mind and body are connected. He treated our labor seriously, and expected us to do the same. Excellence ‚Äî ar√™te ‚Äî was our goal. I‚Äôll admit that plenty of times I tuned out the talk, but there was something about sitting down as a team to transition from school to sport, using that time to mentally prepare for the physical work.\n\nOne of my favorite rituals was to honor outgoing seniors on the cross-country team. At the final home race of the season, each senior released one of his homing pigeons. (I was annoyed because I had to share a pigeon üòÇ) As far as I can remember, there was no special meaning to this, it just was a thing that he made happen each year. A created ceremony we nonetheless looked forward to; simply having some marker, however arbitrary, gave the season an emotional culmination beyond the final race, recognition of our contributions to the team regardless of how we placed.\n\nHe built the team‚Äôs culture through these shared rites and rituals, building a sense of continuity with past runners both at our school and at the origins of track in Ancient Greece.\n\nI can‚Äôt talk about ritual and Mr. Taylor without also talking about Ar√™te West. Starting in 1979, every other year he took a group of about eight students from the track or cross country team to Greece. At first, they went to compete, but over the years it shifted into more of a philosophical journey and extended into greater Europe. Over the course of twenty trips, the experience developed its own rituals. (I went on trip thirteen.)\n\nThe first: secret invitation. My best friend hounded me, but I wouldn‚Äôt confess that I‚Äôd received The Postcard telling me when and where our first meeting would be. (We met every other week throughout the school year to study and prepare for the trip.) We all showed up that first night unsure who the seven other voyagers would be. In my year, the eighth person no-showed ‚Äî we never found out who else had been invited and declined to join.\n\nThe trip itself teemed with rituals. My least favorite involved running through the hot, dusty Greek countryside to an ancient track where we were expected to take off our shoes and run a lap in bare feet, like the runners of old. On Ithaca, we ran, separately, to ‚ÄúTelemachos‚Äô beach‚Äù. In Delphi, we were meant to sleep in ‚Äúthe meadow‚Äù where many past Arete trips had slept (but he couldn‚Äôt find it in the twilight, so we slept on a random dirt road üòí Apparently on my sister‚Äôs trip there was a dead dog in the meadow and they said no fucking way).\n\nMr. Taylor believed strongly in the power of place and designed the experience to provoke encounters with meaning. (Some more successful than others‚Ä¶) I lugged my clarinet across Europe so I could play Mozart‚Äôs clarinet concerto outside the building where he died (?). Everywhere we went, one or another of us had been assigned topics to present on or locations to give a reading. (I botched my reading from The Agony and The Ecstasy at the Vatican and read a passage about the wrong Michaelangelo Mother and Child sculpture ü§£) Overlooking the Acropolis, one of the boys had to read us Pericles‚Äôs funeral speech, as each trip had done before us.

{"title": "Juanita Garden Tour ‚Äì Tracy Durnell's Mind Garden", "url": "https://tracydurnell.com/2025/06/07/juanita-garden-tour/", "content": "I had a blast visiting five gardens around the Juanita neighborhood üòÉ There were 12 gardens on the tour but I think you‚Äôd be hard-pressed to see them all! I started at 11 and was wiped by 2:30 so I didn‚Äôt push myself to squeeze in one more.\n\nEnjoyed talking with several of the homeowners too ‚Äî one of them has written a book on mushrooming! He had a massive table spread with morels drying in the sun.\n\n‚ÄúChampagne Creek‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThis private garden has expanded and grown into a utopia of rare plants, exotic fowl, native habitat and so much more.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhimsical eclecticism is Kathy‚Äôs guiding principle.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBloom‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThis 1/2-acre garden is an artistic attempt to paint with flowers and plants: full of color, texture and whimsy.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThe Half Acre Wood‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúEvergreen Hollow‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNestled in the lush climate of the PNW, Evergreen Hollow is a harmonious fusion of Japanese serenity, whimsical fairy charm, and intricate bonsai artistry.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúDahlia House Gardens‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúOur gardens, at over an acre, are a controlled chaos of thousands of perennials, fruit trees, berry bushes and veggie gardens. We have collected seeds and plants from Tibet, Europe and elsewhere and enjoy a very English style profusion with lawn and intertwined stairs and hidden trails.‚Äù (This garden was very much my vibe.)\n\nTakeaways\n\nIt‚Äôs lovely to see stunning gardens like these, but also having paid for landscaping, I have to distinguish between what someone could accomplish with many tens of thousands of dollars of hardscaping and what could be adaptable to my yard. Some of the gardens leaned on sweat equity and cleverness, which is what my budget calls for üòâ Boulders are $$$ as much as I love how they look ü•∫ (Our landscape plan originally called for a fountain but the landscaper wasn‚Äôt willing to wait for electricity to be trenched, since it would need an inspection, even though they saw the plans when we got the quote üôÑ so, we have a bird bath)\n\nI think some cheapish landscaping cobblestones, metal arches, and more yard art could go a fair ways to adding finish to my garden. I also suspect another couple Japanese maples could pull things together. More paths / focal points in the backyard would be beneficial visually ‚Äî we didn‚Äôt bother because the freeway is so loud we just wanted it to look pretty out the window ‚Äî but I‚Äôm finding that there is a lack of places for the eye to land when it‚Äôs all green all the time. Without a lawn, and with the path so close to the house you can‚Äôt see it from inside, we have few ‚Äúedges‚Äù.", "label": "personal"}
{"title": "Back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù ‚Äì Tracy Durnell's Mind Garden", "url": "https://tracydurnell.com/2025/06/15/back-to-normal/", "content": "Not to pick on this person, it‚Äôs a funny protest sign ‚Äî but it seems like a lot of people are thinking like we‚Äôre in a ‚Äúone weird trick‚Äù (impeachment) scenario and, once we get that done, we‚Äôll magically return to some type of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and we can all go home‚Ä¶ but the concept of normality is doing some heavy lifting here.\n\nWhat ‚Äúnormal‚Äù looks like\n\nIt‚Äôs normal for minimum wage to stay the same for decades.\n\nIt‚Äôs normal that people earning low wages must work multiple jobs and often still qualify for food stamps.\n\nIt‚Äôs normal that billionaires exist when low-paid workers have to decide between the power bill and paying the rent.\n\nIt‚Äôs normal that disabled people effectively cannot marry, since they‚Äôll often lose access to government support.\n\nIt‚Äôs normal to use prisoners as slave labor (or close enough to it with hourly ‚Äúwages‚Äù of pennies).\n\nIt‚Äôs normal that immigrants from some countries must wait decades to become citizens because of arbitrary caps.\n\nIt‚Äôs normal to let immigrants get paid less and treated worse in tech jobs because they‚Äôre trapped by H1B visa requirements.\n\nIt‚Äôs normal that *everyone* in America is to some extent trapped in their job because healthcare is ruinously expensive.\n\nIt‚Äôs normal that Americans die of preventable disease for lack of money.\n\nIt‚Äôs normal that women don‚Äôt get to choose what medical treatment they receive if they are pregnant.\n\nIt‚Äôs normal to address gun violence by blaming mental health but not increasing funding to expand access.\n\nIt‚Äôs normal to ‚Äúsolve‚Äù homelessness by throwing away all of someone‚Äôs worldly possessions and putting them on a one-way bus out of town.\n\nIt‚Äôs normal that kids go hungry at lunch.\n\nIt‚Äôs normal that Puerto Ricans and people from D.C. are denied congressional representation.\n\nIt‚Äôs normal that 70- and 80-year-olds hold most of the political power in the country, and people under 40 very little.\n\nIt‚Äôs normal to hand over all our personal data to megacorporations who run extensive systems of surveillance that they share with law enforcement.\n\nIt‚Äôs normal that the government spies on its own citizens.\n\nIt‚Äôs normal that hundreds of people die in car crashes daily.\n\nIt‚Äôs normal that our spaces are built for cars, not people, and driving is often the only way to get around.\n\nIt‚Äôs normal that the US government doesn‚Äôt honor its treaties with Tribes.\n\nIt‚Äôs normal that we supply Israel with funding while they enact genocide.\n\nIt‚Äôs normal that our water rights system is so terrible, and our water use so excessive, that the Colorado River no longer reaches the Gulf of California.\n\nIt‚Äôs normal that downstream communities must bear the health burdens and costs of upstream industrial polluters.\n\nThinking bigger than just getting out of this\n\n‚ÄúNormal‚Äù fucking sucks. Outright fascism is worse, but there are plenty of things we need to change. Kat Abughazaleh, who‚Äôs running for office in Illinois, says:\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no reason every American should not be able to afford housing, groceries, health insurance, public transit (ideally), and then still have enough money to save and take your kid to the zoo or go to the movies with your friends. There‚Äôs just, there‚Äôs no reason ‚Äî we are the wealthiest country in the world. The idea that that‚Äôs unrealistic or idealistic or naive or even called childish, I think that‚Äôs sucky.‚Äù\n\nWe don‚Äôt have to settle for returning to a normal that sucks ‚Äî but protest may not be enough to force change. Our current situation has been the Republican gameplan for decades; we will not escape it by liberating ourselves from a single politician. Trump is a symptom, but the rot runs much deeper. We need to reckon emotionally with the long fights ahead; protests alone will not solve our problems. I‚Äôm not saying protest isn‚Äôt helpful or important ‚Äî I‚Äôm saying that we need to find space for both brunch and advocacy in our lives. Micah L. Sifry writes:\n\nOne of the most inspiring ways that pro-democracy movements grow their strength is by inventing and spreading ways for the silent majority to make itself both visible and influential.\n\nI‚Äôve been seeing organizers talking about the need to transform the current energy into long-term work, and not let it fizzle out. Jared Yates Sexton describes the way that authorities rein in public speech:\n\nWe are, according to those who want nothing more than to maintain control, supposed to protest enough, but not too much. Because we should rely on them. Because we need to maintain our subservient position under the party as opposed to in conversation and discourse with the party.\n\nOne strategy: focusing on local advocacy and building up\n\nMy pet theory is that most people should spend their advocacy time supporting local (and state) efforts, and donate to organizations advocating at the federal level. The collapse of local news and intense media focus on national politics encourages people to feel powerless because at the federal level most of what you can do is harass your senator. It also frames politics as something ‚Äúyou do‚Äù once every four years for normies, every two years for the passionate, every election for the wonks and zealots. If you get people involved in local politics, I imagine that get-out-the-vote drives become a lot easier because people are already tuned in.\n\nThe local level is more influential than people realize, I suspect. In Washington State, how environmental policies often play out is that they get implemented at either King County or City of Seattle first, then several suburban cities, and then there‚Äôs a model and coalition for building a state-level policy. As former city staff, I can say it‚Äôs no accident it works this way ‚Äî we knew our colleagues at other cities and would learn from each other, sharing lessons and draft policy language. Regional organizations support, both partnering with cities and going down to Olympia during the legislative session to advocate for (and against) bills. We know that Republicans followed a similar model in the evil direction in red states, building up a portfolio of harmful policies to bring to the federal level in the form of Project 2025‚Ä¶ why don‚Äôt we do the same for progressive policies?\n\nIf we start thinking and working now, we can set things up for the next state legislative session, then the next federal election, then the presidential election. (I‚Äôm not going down rabbitholes about martial law, I don‚Äôt find it helpful to indulge in that kind of despairing fatalism ‚Äî I think my personal work on managing catastrophic thinking and anxiety has paid dividends here.)\n\nI haven‚Äôt decided what bigger thing I want to work on yet‚Ä¶ for now I‚Äôve just been doing ad hoc advocacy when it‚Äôs pointed out by the urbanist Discord server I‚Äôm in. I‚Äôm pissed that Washington had a school lunch bill that failed in the legislative session, so potentially supporting another run at that‚Ä¶ or badgering the governor about Washington‚Äôs regressive taxation policy and demanding an income tax on the wealthiest Washingtonians, which he put the kibosh on this budget cycle and was why the budget was too tight to feed kids üôÑ Come on, Bob! We have a lot of tech companies ‚Äî and tech CEOs ‚Äî here who could stand to pay their fair share. Or I could go harder on supporting housing; I just looked at King County‚Äôs affordable housing dashboard, which identifies a need for 44,000 affordable units by 2024, and THE ENTIRE SEATTLE AREA HAD BUILT FEWER THAN FIVE THOUSAND UNITS by 2022. *screaming*\n\nOrganizing coalitions\n\nI‚Äôm also spinning on the provocation of the second method of organizing described in the Win the Midwest‚Äôs 10-year report (emphasis mine):\n\nThere are two approaches to base building. We can ask what we are for, and then go out and find the people who agree with us. Or we can begin by asking who we need to organize in order to build enough power to shift everything, and then go where they are: workplaces, churches, mosques, synagogues, schools, and childcare centers. Grassroots organizations that meet people where they are ‚Äì physically and ideologically ‚Äì and that create spaces of belonging, learning, and formation rooted in people‚Äôs lives and experiences have an unlimited number of people to organize. Most people do not have clearly defined political outlooks, but they can move into public leadership roles. Organizations willing to put their base at the center of their plans can co-create a political agenda that emerges from the lived experience of their bases.\n\nI‚Äôm an extremely opinionated person, and I know what outcomes I want (though I‚Äôd rather listen to others on the best tactics on achieving those outcomes), but maybe I could think of this as prioritizing which outcomes to focus on based on which ones enough other people also want and will fight for. L.A. Kauffman discusses building coalitions with those we disagree with, quoting a 1981 talk / 1983 essay ‚ÄúCoalition Politics: Turning the Century‚Äù:\n\n‚ÄúThe reason we are stumbling,‚Äù Dr. [Bernice] Reagon declared all those years ago, ‚Äúis that we are at the point where in order to take the next step we‚Äôve got to do it with some folk we don‚Äôt care too much about. And we got to vomit over that for a little while. We must just keep going.‚Äù\n\nFurther reading:\n\nWhy Do Anything? by Dj Bracken ‚Äî this guy decided to start paying down student lunch debt in Utah, and eventually helped get a statewide bill passed (I was loosely involved in supporting new ‚Äúshare tables‚Äù / fridges at our local elementary schools, AMA)\n\nFrom Aspiration to Action: Organizing Through Exhaustion, Grief, and Uncertainty by Kelly Hayes\n\nSee also:\n\nDon‚Äôt let them say it‚Äôs normal\n\nExtending my understanding of self-care\n\nBeing a citizen means taking ownership", "label": "personal"}

{"title": "IssueOps: Automate CI/CD (and more!) with GitHub Issues and Actions", "url": "https://github.blog/engineering/issueops-automate-ci-cd-and-more-with-github-issues-and-actions/", "content": "Software development is filled with repetitive tasks‚Äîmanaging issues, handling approvals, triggering CI/CD workflows, and more. But what if you could automate these types of tasks directly within GitHub Issues? That‚Äôs the promise of IssueOps, a methodology that turns GitHub Issues into a command center for automation.\n\nWhether you‚Äôre a solo developer or part of an engineering team, IssueOps helps you streamline operations without ever leaving your repository.\n\nIn this article, I‚Äôll explore the concept of IssueOps using state-machine terminology and strategies to help you work more efficiently on GitHub. After all, who doesn‚Äôt love automation?\n\nWhat is IssueOps?\n\nIssueOps is the practice of using GitHub Issues, GitHub Actions, and pull requests (PR) as an interface for automating workflows. Instead of switching between tools or manually triggering actions, you can use issue comments, labels, and state changes to kick off CI/CD pipelines, assign tasks, and even deploy applications.\n\nMuch like the various other *Ops paradigms (ChatOps, ClickOps, and so on), IssueOps is a collection of tools, workflows, and concepts that, when applied to GitHub Issues, can automate mundane, repetitive tasks. The flexibility and power of issues, along with their relationship to pull requests, create a near limitless number of possibilities, such as managing approvals and deployments. All of this can really help to simplify your workflows on GitHub. I‚Äôm speaking from personal experience here.\n\nIt‚Äôs important to note that IssueOps isn‚Äôt just a DevOps thing! Where DevOps offers a methodology to bring developers and operations into closer alignment, IssueOps is a workflow automation practice centered around GitHub Issues. IssueOps lets you run anything from complex CI/CD pipelines to a bed and breakfast reservation system. If you can interact with it via an API, there‚Äôs a good chance you can build it with IssueOps!\n\nSo, why use IssueOps?\n\nThere are lots of benefits to utilizing IssueOps. Here‚Äôs how it‚Äôs useful in practice:\n\nIt‚Äôs event driven, so you can automate the boring stuff: IssueOps lets you automate workflows directly from GitHub Issues and pull requests, turning everyday interactions‚Äîfrom kicking off a CI/CD pipeline and managing approvals to updating project boards‚Äîinto powerful triggers for GitHub Actions.\n\nIssueOps lets you automate workflows directly from GitHub Issues and pull requests, turning everyday interactions‚Äîfrom kicking off a CI/CD pipeline and managing approvals to updating project boards‚Äîinto powerful triggers for GitHub Actions. It‚Äôs customizable, so you can tailor workflows to your needs: No two teams work the same way, and IssueOps is flexible enough to adapt. Whether you‚Äôre automating bug triage or triggering deployments, you can customize workflows based on event type and data provided.\n\nIt‚Äôs transparent, so you can keep a record: All actions taken on an issue are logged in its timeline, creating an easy-to-follow record of what happened and when.\n\nIt‚Äôs immutable, so you can audit whenever you need: Because IssueOps uses GitHub Issues and pull requests as a source of truth, every action leaves a record. No more chasing approvals in Slack or manually triggering workflows: IssueOps keeps everything structured, automated, and auditable right inside GitHub.\n\nOur quickstart guide to IssueOps Step 1: Define your triggers\n\nIdentify the actions that should kick off your workflows‚Äîlike opening an issue, adding a label, or merging a pull request. These events can serve as triggers for GitHub Actions.\n\nIdentify the actions that should kick off your workflows‚Äîlike opening an issue, adding a label, or merging a pull request. These events can serve as triggers for GitHub Actions. Step 2: Configure GitHub Actions Use GitHub Actions to define what happens when an event occurs. For example, if an issue is labeled deploy, you could trigger a deployment script. YAML never looked so good.\n\nStep 3: Test and iterate Like any good automation, IssueOps workflows should be tested and refined. Start small, see what works, and expand from there. Let‚Äôs go: Learn more in our repository.\n\nDefining IssueOps workflows and how they‚Äôre like finite-state machines\n\nMost IssueOps workflows follow the same basic pattern:\n\nA user opens an issue and provides information about a request The issue is validated to ensure it contains the required information The issue is submitted for processing Approval is requested from an authorized user or team The request is processed and the issue is closed\n\nSuppose you‚Äôre an administrator of an organization and want to reduce the overhead of managing team members. In this instance, you could use IssueOps to build an automated membership request and approval process. Within a workflow like this, you‚Äôd have several core steps:\n\nA user creates a request to be added to a team The request is validated The request is submitted for approval An administrator approves or denies this request The request is processed If approved, the user is added to the team If denied, the user is not added to the team The user is notified of the outcome\n\nWhen designing your own IssueOps workflows, it can be very helpful to think of them as a finite-state machine: a model for how objects move through a series of states in response to external events. Depending on certain rules defined within the state machine, a number of different actions can take place in response to state changes. If this is a little too complex, you can also think of it like a flow chart.\n\nTo apply this comparison to IssueOps, an issue is the object that is processed by a state machine. It changes state in response to events. As the object changes state, certain actions may be performed as part of a transition, provided any required conditions (guards) are met. Once an end state is reached, the issue can be closed.\n\nThis breaks down into a few key concepts:\n\nState : A point in an object‚Äôs lifecycle that satisfies certain condition(s).\n\n: A point in an object‚Äôs lifecycle that satisfies certain condition(s). Event : An external occurrence that triggers a state change.\n\n: An external occurrence that triggers a state change. Transition : A link between two states that, when traversed by an object, will cause certain action(s) to be performed.\n\n: A link between two states that, when traversed by an object, will cause certain action(s) to be performed. Action : An atomic task that is performed when a transition is taken.\n\n: An atomic task that is performed when a transition is taken. Guard: A condition that is evaluated when a trigger event occurs. A transition is taken only if all associated guard condition(s) are met.\n\nHere‚Äôs a simple state diagram for the example I discussed above.\n\nNow, let‚Äôs dive into the state machine in more detail!\n\nKey concepts behind state machines\n\nThe benefit of breaking your workflow down into these components is that you can look for edge cases, enforce conditions, and create a robust, reliable result.\n\nStates\n\nWithin a state machine, a state defines the current status of an object. As the object transitions through the state machine, it will change states in response to external events. When building IssueOps workflows, common states for issues include opened, submitted, approved, denied, and closed.\n\nThese should suffice as the core states to consider when building our workflows in our team membership example above.\n\nEvents\n\nIn a state machine, an event can be any form of interaction with the object and its current state. When building your own IssueOps, you should consider events from both the user and GitHub points of view.\n\nIn our team membership request example, there are several events that can trigger a change in state. The request can be created, submitted, approved, denied, or processed.\n\nIn this example, a user interacting with an issue‚Äîsuch as adding labels, commenting, or updating milestones‚Äîcan also change its state. In GitHub Actions, there are many events that can trigger your workflows (see events that trigger workflows).\n\nHere are a few interactions, or events, that would affect our example IssueOps workflow when it comes to managing team members:\n\nRequest Event State Request is created issues opened Request is approved issue_comment created Request is denied issue_comment created\n\nAs you can see, the same GitHub workflow trigger can apply to multiple events in our state machine. Because of this, validation is key. Within your workflows, you should check both the type of event and the information provided by the user. In this case, we can conditionally trigger different workflow steps based on the content of the issue_comment event.\n\njobs: approve: name: Process Approval runs-on: ubuntu-latest if: ${{ startsWith(github.event.comment.body, '.approve') }} # ... deny: name: Process Denial runs-on: ubuntu-latest if: ${{ startsWith(github.event.comment.body, '.deny') }} # ...\n\nTransitions\n\nA transition is simply the change from one state to another. In our example, for instance, a transition occurs when someone opens an issue. When a request meets certain conditions, or guards, the change in state can take place. When the transition occurs, some actions or processing may take place, as well.\n\nWith our example workflow, you can think of the transitions themselves as the lines connecting different nodes in the state diagram. Or the lines connecting boxes in a flow chart.\n\nGuards\n\nGuards are conditions that must be verified before an event can trigger a transition to a different state. In our case, we know the following guards must be in place:\n\nA request should not transition to an Approved state unless an administrator comments .approve on the issue.\n\non the issue. A request should not transition to a Denied state unless an administrator comments .deny on the issue.\n\nWhat about after the request is approved and the user is added to the team? This is referred to as an unguarded transition. There are no conditions that must be met, so the transition happens immediately!\n\nActions\n\nLastly, actions are specific tasks that are performed during a transition. They may affect the object itself, but this is not a requirement in our state machine. In our example, the following actions may take place at different times:\n\nAdministrators are notified that a request has been submitted\n\nThe user is added to the requested team\n\nThe user is notified of the outcome\n\nA real-world example: Building a team membership workflow with IssueOps\n\nNow that all of the explanation is out of the way, let‚Äôs dive into building our example! For reference, we‚Äôll focus on the GitHub Actions workflows involved in building this automation. There are some additional repository and permissions settings involved that are discussed in more detail in these IssueOps docs.\n\nStep 1: Issue form template\n\nGitHub issue forms let you create standardized, formatted issues based on a set of form fields. Combined with the issue-ops/parser action, you can get reliable, machine-readable JSON from issue body Markdown. For our example, we are going to create a simple form that accepts a single input: the team where we want to add the user.\n\nname: Team Membership Request description: Submit a new membership request title: New Team Membership Request labels: - team-membership body: - type: input id: team attributes: label: Team Name description: The team name you would like to join placeholder: my-team validations: required: true\n\nWhen issues are created using this form, they will be parsed into JSON, which can then be passed to the rest of the IssueOps workflow.\n\n{ \"team\": \"my-team\" }\n\nStep 2: Issue validation\n\nWith a machine-readable issue body, we can run additional validation checks to ensure the information provided follows any rules we might have in place. For example, we can‚Äôt automatically add a user to a team if the team doesn‚Äôt exist yet! That is where the issue-ops/validator action comes into play. Using an issue form template and a custom validation script, we can confirm the existence of the team ahead of time.\n\nmodule.exports = async (field) => { const { Octokit } = require('@octokit/rest') const core = require('@actions/core') const github = new Octokit({ auth: core.getInput('github-token', { required: true }) }) try { // Check if the team exists core.info(`Checking if team '${field}' exists`) await github.rest.teams.getByName({ org: process.env.GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER ?? '', team_slug: field }) core.info(`Team '${field}' exists`) return 'success' } catch (error) { if (error.status === 404) { // If the team does not exist, return an error message core.error(`Team '${field}' does not exist`) return `Team '${field}' does not exist` } else { // Otherwise, something else went wrong... throw error } } }\n\nWhen included in our IssueOps workflow, this adds any validation error(s) to the comment on the issue.\n\nStep 3: Issue workflows\n\nThe main ‚Äúentrypoint‚Äù of this workflow occurs when a user creates or edits their team membership request issue. This workflow should focus heavily on validating any user inputs! For example, what should happen if the user inputs a team that does not exist?\n\nIn our state machine, this workflow is responsible for handling everything up to the opened state. Any time an issue is created, edited, or updated, it will re-run validation to ensure the request is ready to be processed. In this case, an additional guard condition is introduced. Before the request can be submitted, the user must comment with .submit after validation has passed.\n\nname: Process Issue Open/Edit on: issues: types: - opened - edited - reopened permissions: contents: read id-token: write issues: write jobs: validate: name: Validate Request runs-on: ubuntu-latest # This job should only be run on issues with the `team-membership` label. if: ${{ contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, 'team-membership') }} steps: # This is required to ensure the issue form template and any validation # scripts are included in the workspace. - name: Checkout id: checkout uses: actions/checkout@v4 # Since this workflow includes custom validation scripts, we need to # install Node.js and any dependencies. - name: Setup Node.js id: setup-node uses: actions/setup-node@v4 # Install dependencies from `package.json`. - name: Install Dependencies id: install run: npm install # GitHub App authentication is required if you want to interact with any # resources outside the scope of the repository this workflow runs in. - name: Get GitHub App Token id: token uses: actions/create-github-app-token@v1 with: app-id: ${{ vars.ISSUEOPS_APP_ID }} private-key: ${{ secrets.ISSUEOPS_APP_PRIVATE_KEY }} owner: ${{ github.repository_owner }} # Remove any labels and start fresh.

Your request has been validated successfully! Please comment with `.submit` to submit this request.\n\nOnce the issue is created, any further processing is triggered using issue comments‚Äîand this can be done with one workflow. However, to make things a bit easier to follow, we‚Äôll break this into a few separate workflows.\n\nSubmit workflow\n\nThe first workflow handles the user submitting the request. The main task it performs is validating the issue body against the form template to ensure it hasn‚Äôt been modified.\n\nname: Process Submit Comment on: issue_comment: types: - created permissions: contents: read id-token: write issues: write jobs: submit: name: Submit Request runs-on: ubuntu-latest # This job should only be run when the following conditions are true: # # - A user comments `.submit` on the issue. # - The issue has the `team-membership` label. # - The issue has the `validated` label. # - The issue does not have the `approved` or `denied` labels. # - The issue is open. if: | startsWith(github.event.comment.body, '.submit') && contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, 'team-membership') == true && contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, 'approved') == false && contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, 'denied') == false && github.event.issue.state == 'open' steps: # First, we are going to re-run validation.

With a handful of standardized workflows, you have an end-to-end, issue-driven process in place to manage team membership. This can be extended as far as you want, including support for removing users, auditing access, and more. With IssueOps, the sky is the limit!\n\nHere‚Äôs the best thing about IssueOps: It brings another level of automation to a surface I‚Äôm constantly using‚Äîand that‚Äôs GitHub. By using issues and pull requests as control centers for workflows, teams can reduce friction, improve efficiency, and keep everything transparent. Whether you want to automate deployments, approvals, or bug triage, IssueOps makes it all possible, without ever leaving your repo.\n\nFor more information and examples, check out the open source IssueOps documentation repository, and if you want a deeper dive, you can head over to the open source IssueOps documentation.\n\nIn my experience, it‚Äôs always best to start small and experiment with what works best for you. With just a bit of time, you‚Äôll see your workflows get smoother with every commit (I know I have). Happy coding! ‚ú®\n\nTags:", "label": "personal"}

So if you‚Äôre only using them to provide status updates, you‚Äôre leaving a lot on the table.\n\nI didn‚Äôt fully realize this potential until I mentioned in a one-on-one that I was interested in mentorship and growing my leadership skills. Not long after, I was asked to co-lead a project with an intern to build an internal tool that helped surface enterprise configuration details. This gave me the opportunity to take technical ownership on a project while mentoring someone in a real-world context‚Äîboth of which pushed me outside my comfort zone in the best way. That experience made it clear: When used intentionally, one-on-ones can open doors you didn‚Äôt even know were there.\n\nMany engineers treat one-on-ones as a low-stakes standup: reporting work, mentioning blockers, and getting general feedback. While that can be useful, it barely scratches the surface of what these meetings can accomplish. Instead, think of them as a system design review for your role‚Äîa time to debug challenges, optimize your workflow, and align on long-term career goals.\n\nReframing your perception of what a one-on-one can accomplish\n\nA well-structured one-on-one meeting with your manager isn‚Äôt just a check-in, it‚Äôs an opportunity to shape your work environment and career trajectory. You wouldn‚Äôt build a system without evaluating its constraints, dependencies, and long-term maintainability. Why approach your career any differently?\n\nStart by shifting your mindset: These meetings are not status updates. Your manager already sees your pull requests, sprint velocity, and planning docs. Instead, use this time to highlight what matters‚Äîwhat you‚Äôve shipped, the value it‚Äôs delivered, and where the friction is.\n\nYou can also use this space to validate decisions and gather context. If you‚Äôre weighing different paths forward, don‚Äôt just ask for approval‚Äîframe the conversation in terms of trade-offs:\n\n‚ÄúHere are the pros and cons of refactoring this service now versus later. How does this align with our broader business goals?‚Äù\n\nTreat your manager like a decision-making API: Feed in the relevant signals, surface what‚Äôs unclear, and work together on an informed response.\n\nUse one-on-ones for career versioning (even before you‚Äôre ‚Äúready‚Äù)\n\nOne-on-one meetings are a great time to discuss your long-term career growth‚Äîeven if you‚Äôre not actively seeking a promotion. Instead of waiting until promotion season, start having these conversations early to build clarity, direction, and momentum over time.\n\nIf you‚Äôre more than a year away from seeking a promotion, start talking to your manager about: Where am I already meeting expectations? Where should I focus on strengthening my skills?\n\nIf you‚Äôre approaching the next level or considering going up for promotion soon, try focusing the conversation on: What kind of work would demonstrate readiness for the next level? Are there specific opportunities I can take on to grow my scope or visibility?\n\n\n\nBy treating growth as an iterative process rather than an all-or-nothing milestone, you can continuously improve and course-correct based on early feedback.\n\nA useful framework for structuring these discussions is the Three Circles of Impact:\n\nIndividual Contributions ‚Äì The direct value of your work. Collaboration ‚Äì How you work with and support others across the team. Enabling Others ‚Äì Mentorship, knowledge sharing, or improving systems and tooling for your peers.\n\nIf you‚Äôre not sure how to show impact across all three, your one-on-one is a great place to explore it. The key is surfacing your goals early so your manager can help guide you toward the kinds of work that will stretch your skills and broaden your influence.\n\nThe more you shape your contributions around these areas, the clearer your readiness for growth becomes‚Äîand the easier it is for your manager to advocate on your behalf.\n\nYour manager can‚Äôt debug what they don‚Äôt see\n\nManagers don‚Äôt have full visibility into your day-to-day experience, so one-on-ones are the right time to highlight persistent blockers and unclear expectations.\n\nFor instance, I once brought up a latency issue I was chasing down. The endpoint‚Äôs performance was slightly above our service level objective (SLO) target, and I had already spent a good chunk of time optimizing it. But in that conversation, my manager offered a different lens:\n\n‚ÄúAre we optimizing for the right thing? We control the SLO. If the extra latency is due to how the system is designed (and if users aren‚Äôt impacted) maybe the right move is to revisit the threshold instead of squeezing more performance out of it.‚Äù\n\nThat single conversation saved me hours and helped me reframe the problem entirely. Sometimes, the fix isn‚Äôt in your code‚Äîit‚Äôs in how you‚Äôre measuring success.\n\nMake your one-on-ones work for you\n\nYour one-on-ones will become far more effective‚Äîand lead to real growth‚Äîwhen you treat them as time to think strategically, not just check in. Reframing these meetings around your goals, your environment, and your long-term development puts you in a much stronger position to advocate for yourself and your work.\n\nStart thinking about your career progression earlier than feels natural.

{"title": "How AI code generation works", "url": "https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/how-ai-code-generation-works/", "content": "Generative AI coding tools are changing software production for enterprises. Not just for their code generation abilities‚Äîfrom vulnerability detection and facilitating comprehension of unfamiliar codebases, to streamlining documentation and pull request descriptions, they‚Äôre fundamentally reshaping how developers approach application infrastructure, deployment, and their own work experience.\n\nWe‚Äôre now witnessing a significant turning point. As AI models get better, refusing adoption would be like ‚Äúasking an office worker to use a typewriter instead of a computer,‚Äù says Albert Ziegler, principal researcher and member of the GitHub Next research and development team.\n\nIn this post, we‚Äôll dive into the inner workings of AI code generation, exploring how it functions, its capabilities and benefits, and how developers can use it to enhance their development experience while propelling your enterprise forward in today‚Äôs competitive landscape.\n\nHow to use AI to generate code\n\nAI code generation refers to full or partial lines of code that are generated by machines instead of human developers. This emerging technology leverages advanced machine learning models, particularly large language models (LLMs), to understand and replicate the syntax, patterns, and paradigms found in human-generated code.\n\nThe AI models powering these tools, like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot, are trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources that include a diverse range of code examples. This training enables them to understand the nuances of various programming languages, coding styles, and common practices. As a result, the AI can generate code suggestions that are syntactically correct and contextually relevant based on input from developers.\n\nFavored by 55% of developers, our AI-powered pair programmer, GitHub Copilot, provides contextualized coding assistance based on your organization‚Äôs codebase across dozens of programming languages, and targets developers of all experience levels. With GitHub Copilot, developers can use AI to generate code in three ways:\n\n1. Type code and AI can autocomplete the code\n\nAutocompletions are the earliest version of AI code generation. John Berryman, a senior researcher of ML on the GitHub Copilot team, explains the user experience: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be writing code and taking a pause to think. While I‚Äôm doing that, the agent itself is also thinking, looking at surrounding code and content in neighboring tabs. Then it pops up on the screen as gray ‚Äòghost text‚Äô that I can reject, partially accept, or fully accept and then, if necessary, modify.‚Äù\n\nWhile every developer can reap the benefits of using AI coding tools, experienced programmers can often feel these gains even more so. ‚ÄúIn many cases, especially for experienced programmers in a familiar environment, this suggestion speeds us up. I would have written the same thing. It‚Äôs just faster to hit ‚Äòtab‚Äô (thus accepting the suggestion) than it is to write out those 20 characters by myself,‚Äù says Johan Rosenkilde, principal researcher for GitHub Next.\n\nWhether developers are new or highly skilled, they‚Äôll often have to work in less familiar languages, and code completion suggestions using GitHub Copilot can lend a helping hand. ‚ÄúUsing GitHub Copilot for code completion has really helped speed up my learning experience,‚Äù says Berryman. ‚ÄúI will often accept the suggestion because it‚Äôs something I wouldn‚Äôt have written on my own since I don‚Äôt know the syntax.‚Äù\n\nUsing an AI coding tool has become an invaluable skill in itself. Why? Because the more developers practice coding with these tools, the faster they‚Äôll get at using them.\n\nFor experienced developers in unfamiliar environments, tools like GitHub Copilot can even help jog their memories.\n\nLet‚Äôs say a developer imports a new type of library they haven‚Äôt used before, or that they don‚Äôt remember. Maybe they‚Äôre looking to figure out the standard library function or the order of the argument. In these cases, it can be helpful to make GitHub Copilot more explicitly aware of where the developer wants to go by writing a comment.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs quite likely that the developer might not remember the formula, but they can recognize the formula, and GitHub Copilot can remember it by being prompted,‚Äù says Rosenkilde. This is where natural language commentary comes into play: it can be a shortcut for explaining intent when the developer is struggling with the first few characters of code that they need.\n\nIf developers give specific names to their functions and variables, and write documentation, they can get better suggestions, too. That‚Äôs because GitHub Copilot can read the variable names and use them as an indicator for what that function should do.\n\nSuddenly that changes how developers write code for the better, because code with good variable and function names are more maintainable. And oftentimes the main job of a programmer is to maintain code, not write it from scratch.\n\n‚ÄúWhen you push that code, someone is going to review it, and they will likely have a better time reviewing that code if it‚Äôs well named, if there‚Äôs even a hint of documentation in it, and so on,‚Äù says Rosenkilde. In this sense, the symbiotic relationship between the developer and the AI coding tool is not just beneficial for the developer, but for the entire team.\n\n3. Chat directly with AI\n\nWith AI chatbots, code generation can be more interactive. GitHub Copilot Chat, for example, allows developers to interact with code by asking it to explain code, improve syntax, provide ideas, generate tests, and modify existing code‚Äîmaking it a versatile ally in managing coding tasks.\n\nRosenkilde uses the different functionalities of GitHub Copilot:\n\n‚ÄúWhen I want to do something and I can‚Äôt remember how to do it, I type the first few letters of it, and then I wait to see if Copilot can guess what I‚Äôm doing,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIf that doesn‚Äôt work, maybe I delete those characters and I write a one liner in commentary and see whether Copilot can guess the next line. If that doesn‚Äôt work, then I go to Copilot Chat and explain in more detail what I want done.‚Äù\n\nTypically, Copilot Chat returns with something much more verbose and complete than what you get from GitHub Copilot code completion. ‚ÄúNamely, it describes back to you what it is you want done and how it can be accomplished. It gives you code examples, and you can respond and say, oh, I see where you‚Äôre going. But actually I meant it like this instead,‚Äù says Rosenkilde.\n\nBut using AI chatbots doesn‚Äôt mean developers should be hands off. Mistakes in reasoning could lead the AI down a path of further mistakes if left unchecked. Berryman recommends that users should interact with the chat assistant in much the same way that you would when pair programming with a human. ‚ÄúGo back and forth with it. Tell the assistant about the task you are working on, ask it for ideas, have it help you write code, and critique and redirect the assistant‚Äôs work in order to keep it on the right track.‚Äù\n\nThe importance of code reviews\n\nGitHub Copilot is designed to empower developers to execute their ideas. As long as there is some context for it to draw on, it will likely generate the type of code the developer wants. But this doesn‚Äôt replace code reviews between developers.\n\nCode reviews play an important role in maintaining code quality and reliability in software projects, regardless of whether AI coding tools are involved. In fact, the earlier developers can spot bugs in the code development process, the cheaper it is by orders of magnitude.\n\nOrdinary verification would be: does the code parse? Do the tests work? With AI code generation, Ziegler explains that developers should, ‚ÄúScrutinize it in enough detail so that you can be sure the generated code is correct and bug-free. Because if you use tools like that in the wrong way and just accept everything, then the bugs that you introduce are going to cost you more time than you save.‚Äù\n\nRosenkilde adds, ‚ÄúA review with another human being is not the same as that, right? It‚Äôs a conversation between two developers about whether this change fits into the kind of software they‚Äôre building in this organization. GitHub Copilot doesn‚Äôt replace that.‚Äù\n\nThe advantages of using AI to generate code\n\nWhen developer teams use AI coding tools across the software development cycle, they experience a host of benefits, including:\n\nFaster development, more productivity\n\nAI code generation can significantly speed up the development process by automating repetitive and time-consuming tasks. This means that developers can focus on high-level architecture and problem-solving. In fact, 88% of developers reported feeling more productive when using GitHub Copilot.\n\nRosenkilde reflects on his own experience with GitHub‚Äôs AI pair programmer: ‚Äú95% of the time, Copilot brings me joy and makes my day a little bit easier. And this doesn‚Äôt change the code I would have written. It doesn‚Äôt change the way I would have written it. It doesn‚Äôt change the design of my code. All it does is it makes me faster at writing that same code.‚Äù And Rosenkilde isn‚Äôt alone: 60% of developers feel more fulfilled with their jobs when using GitHub Copilot.\n\nMental load alleviated\n\nThe benefits of faster development aren‚Äôt just about speed: they‚Äôre also about alleviating the mental effort that comes with completing tedious tasks. For example, when it comes to debugging, developers have to reverse engineer what went wrong. Detecting a bug can involve digging through an endless list of potential hiding places where it might be lurking, making it repetitive and tedious work.\n\nRosenkilde explains, ‚ÄúSometimes when you‚Äôre debugging, you just have to resort to creating print statements that you can‚Äôt get around. Thankfully, Copilot is brilliant at print statements.‚Äù\n\nA whopping 87% of developers reported spending less mental effort on repetitive tasks with the help of GitHub Copilot.\n\nLess context switching\n\nIn software development, context switching is when developers move between different tasks, projects, or environments, which can disrupt their workflow and decrease productivity. They also often deal with the stress of juggling multiple tasks, remembering syntax details, and managing complex code structures.\n\nWith GitHub Copilot developers can bypass several levels of context switching, staying in their IDE instead of searching on Google or jumping into external documentation.\n\n‚ÄúWhen I‚Äôm writing natural language commentary,‚Äù says Rosenkilde, ‚ÄúGitHub Copilot code completion can help me. Or if I use Copilot Chat, it‚Äôs a conversation in the context that I‚Äôm in, and I don‚Äôt have to explain quite as much.‚Äù\n\nGenerating code with AI helps developers offload the responsibility of recalling every detail, allowing them to focus on higher-level thinking, problem-solving, and strategic planning.\n\nBerryman adds, ‚ÄúWith GitHub Copilot Chat, I don‚Äôt have to restate the problem because the code never leaves my trusted environment. And I get an answer immediately. If there is a misunderstanding or follow-up questions, they are easy to communicate with.‚Äù\n\nBefore you implement any AI into your workflow, you should always review and test tools thoroughly to make sure they‚Äôre a good fit for your organization. Here are a few considerations to keep in mind.\n\nCompliance\n\nRegulatory compliance . Does the tool comply with relevant regulations in your industry?\n\n. Does the tool comply with relevant regulations in your industry? Compliance certifications. Are there attestations that demonstrate the tool‚Äôs compliance with regulations?\n\nSecurity\n\nEncryption . Is the data transmission and storage encrypted to protect sensitive information?\n\n.

Look for transparency . Is the pricing structure clear with no hidden costs?\n\n. Is the pricing structure clear with no hidden costs? Scalability. Does the pricing scale with your usage and business growth?\n\nAdditionally, consider factors such as customer support, ease of integration with existing systems, performance, and user experience when evaluating AI coding tools. Lastly, it‚Äôs important to thoroughly assess how well the tool aligns with your organization‚Äôs specific requirements and priorities in each of these areas.\n\nVisit the GitHub Copilot Trust Center to learn more around security, privacy, and other topics.\n\nCan AI code generation be detected?\n\nThe short answer here is: maybe.\n\nLet‚Äôs first give some context to the question. It‚Äôs never really the case that a whole code base is generated with AI, because large chunks of AI-generated code are very likely to be wrong. The standard code review process is a good way to avoid this, since large swaths of completely auto-generated code would stand out to a human developer as simply not working.\n\nFor smaller amounts of AI-generated code, there is no way at the moment to detect traces of AI in code with true confidence. There are offerings that purport to classify whether content has AI-generated text, but there are limited equivalents for code, since you‚Äôd need a dedicated model to do it. Ziegler explains, ‚ÄúComputer generated code is good enough that it doesn‚Äôt leave any particular traces and normally has no clear tells.‚Äù\n\nAt GitHub, the Copilot team makes use of a duplicate detection filter that detects exact duplicates in code. So, if you‚Äôre writing code and it‚Äôs an exact copy of something that exists elsewhere, then it‚Äôll flag it.\n\nIs AI code generation secure?\n\nAI code generation is not any more insecure than human generated code. A combination of testing, manual code reviews, scanning, monitoring, and feedback loops can produce the same quality of code as your human-generated code.\n\nWhen it comes to code generated by GitHub Copilot, developers can use tools like code scanning, which actively reviews your code for potential security issues in real-time and seamlessly integrates the findings into the developer workflow.\n\nUltimately, AI code generation will have vulnerabilities‚Äîbut so does code written by human developers. As Ziegler explains, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unclear whether computer generated code does particularly worse. So, the answer is not if you have GitHub Copilot, use a vulnerability checker. The answer is always use a vulnerability checker.‚Äù\n\nWatch this video for more tips and words of advice around secure coding best practices with AI.\n\nEmpower your enterprise with AI code generation\n\nWhile the benefits to using AI code generation tools can be significant, it‚Äôs important to note that human oversight remains crucial to ensure that the generated code aligns with project goals, coding standards, and business needs.\n\nTech leaders should embrace the use of AI code generation‚Äînot only to streamline development, but also to empower developer teams to collaborate, drive meaningful business outcomes, and deliver exceptional value to customers.\n\nLearn more or get started with the world‚Äôs most widely adopted AI developer tool.\n\nWant to learn how GitHub can help your organization do more with AI?

I am the opposite of pleased. Is she fucking with me? Does she not go on the Internet? In what world am I satisfied that she signed a strongly worded letter and called it good?\n\nMy resentment towards 80yo politicians who won‚Äôt retire and pass their power to the next generation is reaching a rolling boil as the Democrats in charge apparently don‚Äôt have an ounce of urgency left in their moldering bodies. I have to think it‚Äôs intentional, especially given the way Nancy and co blocked Millennial AOC from a position of power in favor of an old dude with cancer who just died from it (‚ÄúGerry‚Äôs a young 74, cancer notwithstanding‚Äù üôÑüôÑüôÑ); I think Boomer politicians know how badly they‚Äôve fucked over everyone younger than them, and they will literally hold power until they die to prevent facing justice.

They booted 25yo David Hogg from DNC leadership as punishment for suggesting the party should not always support incumbents, making a mockery of DEI principles by using gender equality rules to invalidate his election.\n\nA friend and I just looked it up: Nancy Pelosi was first elected in 1987.

{"title": "LiteRT: Maximum performance, simplified", "url": "https://developers.googleblog.com/en/litert-maximum-performance-simplified/", "content": "Over the past decade, mobile phones have incorporated increasingly powerful purpose-specific accelerators including GPUs and recently, more powerful NPUs (Neural Processing Units). By accelerating your AI models on mobile GPUs and NPUs, you can speed up your models by up to 25x compared to CPU while also reducing power consumption by up to 5x. However, unlocking these outstanding performance benefits has proven challenging for most developers, as it requires wrangling HW-specific APIs in case of GPU inference or wrangling vendor-specific SDKs, formats, and runtimes for NPU inference. Listening to your feedback, the Google AI Edge team is excited to announce multiple improvements to LiteRT solving the challenges above, and accelerating AI on mobile more easily with increased performance. Our new release includes a new LiteRT API making on-device ML inference easier than ever, our latest cutting-edge GPU acceleration, new NPU support co-developed with MediaTek and Qualcomm (open for early access), and advanced inference features to maximize performance for on-device applications. Let‚Äôs dive in!\n\nMLDrift: Best GPU Acceleration Yet GPUs have always been at the heart of LiteRT‚Äôs acceleration story, providing the broadest support and most consistent performance improvement. MLDrift, our latest version of GPU acceleration, pushes the bar even further with faster performance and improvements to support models of a significantly larger size through: Smarter Data Organization: MLDrift arranges data in a more efficient way by using optimized tensor layouts and storage types specifically tailored for how GPUs process data, reducing memory access time and speeding up AI calculations. Workgroup Optimization: Smart computation based on context (stage) and resource constraints Improved Data Handling: Streamlining the way the accelerator receives and sends out tensor data to reduce overhead in data transfer and conversion optimizing for data locality.\n\nThis results in significantly faster performance than CPUs, than previous versions of our TFLite GPU delegate, and even other GPU enabled frameworks particularly for CNN and Transformer models.\n\nFigure: Inference latency per model of LiteRT GPU compared to TFLite GPU, measured on Samsung 24.\n\nFind examples in our documentation and give GPU acceleration a try today.\n\nMediaTek and Qualcomm NPU Support NPUs, AI specific accelerators, are becoming increasingly common in flagship phones. They allow you to run AI models much more efficiently, and in many cases much faster. In our internal testing compared to CPUs this acceleration can be up to 25x faster, and 5x more power efficient. (May 2025, based on internal testing) Typically, each vendor provides their own SDKs, including compilers, runtime, and other dependencies, to compile and execute models on their SoCs. The SDK must precisely match the specific SoC version and requires proper download and installation. LiteRT now provides a uniform way to develop and deploy models on NPUs, abstracting away all these complexities. Vendor compiler distribution: When installing the LiteRT PyPI package, we will automatically download the vendor SDKs for compiling models. Model and vendor runtime distribution: The compiled model and SoC runtime will need to be distributed with the app. As a developer you can handle this distribution yourself, or you can have Google Play distribute them for you. In our example code you can see how to use AI Packs and Feature Delivery to deliver the right model and runtime to the right device.\n\nWe‚Äôre excited to partner with MediaTek and Qualcomm to allow developers to accelerate a wide variety of classic ML models, such as vision, audio, and NLP models, on MediaTek and Qualcomm NPUs. Increased model and domain support will continue over the coming year. This feature is available in private preview. For early access apply here.\n\nSimplified GPU and NPU Hardware Acceleration We‚Äôve made GPUs and NPUs easier than ever to use by simplifying the process in the latest version of the LiteRT APIs. With the latest changes, we have simplified the setup significantly with the ability to specify the target backend as an option. As an example, this is how a developer would specify GPU acceleration:\n\n// 1. Load model. auto model = *Model::Load(\"mymodel.tflite\"); // 2. Create a compiled model targeting GPU. auto compiled_model = *CompiledModel::Create(model, kLiteRtHwAcceleratorGpu); C++ Copied\n\nAs you can see, the new CompiledModel API greatly simplifies how to specify the model and target backend(s) for acceleration.\n\nAdvanced Inference for Performance Optimization While using high performance backends is helpful, optimal performance of your application can be hindered by memory, or processor bottlenecks. With the new LiteRT APIs, you can address these challenges by leveraging built-in buffer interoperability to eliminate costly memory copy operations, and asynchronous execution to utilize idle processors in parallel.\n\nSeamless Buffer Interoperability The new TensorBuffer API provides an efficient way to handle input/output data with LiteRT. It allows you to directly use data residing in hardware memory, such as OpenGL Buffers, as inputs or outputs for your CompiledModel, completely eliminating the need for costly CPU copies.\n\nauto tensor_buffer = *litert::TensorBuffer::CreateFromGlBuffer(tensor_type, opengl_buffer); C++ Copied\n\nThis significantly reduces unnecessary CPU overhead and boosts performance.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the TensorBuffer API enables seamless copy-free conversions between different hardware memory types when supported by the system. Imagine effortlessly transforming data from an OpenGL Buffer to an OpenCL Buffer or even to an Android HardwareBuffer without any intermediate CPU transfers. This technique is key to handling the increasing data volumes and demanding performance required by increasingly complex AI models. You can find examples in our documentation on how to use TensorBuffer.\n\nAsynchronous Execution Asynchronous execution allows different parts of the AI model or independent tasks to run concurrently across CPU, GPU, and NPUs allowing you to opportunistically leverage available compute cycles from different processors to improve efficiency and responsiveness. For instance: the CPU might handle data preprocessing the GPU could accelerate matrix multiplications in a neural network layer, and the NPU might efficiently manage specific inference tasks ‚Äì all happening in parallel.\n\nIn applications which require real-time AI interactions, a task can be initiated on one processor and continue with other operations on another. Parallel processing minimizes latency and provides a smoother, more interactive user experience. By effectively managing and overlapping computations across multiple processors, asynchronous execution maximizes system throughput and ensures that the AI application remains fluid and reactive, even under heavy computational loads. Async execution is implemented by using OS-level mechanisms (e.g., sync fences on Android/Linux) allowing one HW accelerator to trigger upon the completion of another HW accelerator directly without involving the CPU. This reduces latency (up to 2x in our GPU async demo) and power consumption while making the pipeline more deterministic. Here is the code snippet showing async inference with OpenGL buffer input:\n\n// Create an input TensorBuffer based on tensor_type that wraps the given OpenGL // Buffer. env is an LiteRT environment to use existing EGL display and context. auto tensor_buffer_from_opengl = *litert::TensorBuffer::CreateFromGlBuffer(env, tensor_type, opengl_buffer); // Create an input event and attach it to the input buffer. Internally, it // creates and inserts a fence sync object into the current EGL command queue. auto input_event = *Event::CreateManaged(env, LiteRtEventTypeEglSyncFence); tensor_buffer_from_opengl.SetEvent(std::move(input_event)); // Create the input and output TensorBuffers‚Ä¶ // Run async inference compiled_model1.RunAsync(input_buffers, output_buffers); C++ Copied", "label": "personal"}

I checked in at UNK around 11am to put my stuff and away. Then I met my awesome roommate Collin. Him and i got to stick together. We are the only guys in the camp. Next we introduced ourselves to the ladies. They are some nice people. The laugh a lot. Like nonstop. Lol.\n\nWe went to go grab some lunch at the diner. The food was great. Im going to love this school. I like the ice cream the best .\n\nOur first activity was about culture. We were asked about describing our culture. Its was quite the open question. It wws alson hard at the same time. It shocked me that many of the participants didn‚Äôt know where there culture was from or any inform about it. It was a learning experience for all of us.\n\nThen we did another activity comparing different cultures in different countries or groups of people. it was interesting seeing the differences.\n\nAfter all this we had dinner. Didn‚Äôt meat much. I had the option to go to the swimming pools or go do something else. So Colin and i decided to do manly things like excersise. The girls went to the pool instead. I ran a out two miles. While running, Colin worked on his football workout. He is going to be a kicker for the UNK football team. Which is pretty awesome.\n\nI then after we played apples to apples. It was quite intense. Then it got crazy funny. The girls were just losing it with nonstop laughing. It was fun. Hey! We had pizza!\n\nOverall I‚Äôm enjoying this camp. I‚Äôm making some great friends and being around people who have great interests as I do.", "label": "personal"}

Who knew old fashion was better? Breakfast wasn't what I was used to. It consisted of A slice of bread with cold cut (deli) meats. You cant forget a great cup of joe! What a simple breakfast? we made kolaches. Kolaches are a traditional food in the Czech Republic. They are formed like a cookie. We make a crater in the center to fill it with fillings. Fillings like apricot or cherry fillings. We also had cream cheese filling. Here is the result.\n\nDelicious right??\n\nThen we went on a tour around Wilber. We learned the history and reasons people moved here. One was religious freedom. (Sound familiar?)\n\nI got to play the bagpipes. It was odd but cool at the same time.\n\n[caption id=\"\"attachment_261\"\" align=\"\"alignnone\"\" width=\"\"225\"\"] Me playing the bagpipes[/caption]\n\nThen we learned how to dance polka and some waltz. It was fun. Now i can dance! (I was salsa dancing in Omaha yesterday.) We had an amazing lunch that consisted of duck, dumplings, sourkrout, and a kolache for dessert. I tought it was best meal in a long time. Czech food is actually good and healthy. Richard I'm coming to the Czech Republic for more food. LOL :-P\n\nTo end the stay in wilber Nebraska the local children entertained us by showing us traditional dances in traditional outfits. I think it is cool that these children are continuing their traditions.\n\nNow I'm back in the dorms. Going to go get ice cream or something. Then I'll go work out with my roommate and have some bro time.\n\nFollow my blog by registering!! On the left!!!\n\n\"", "label": "personal"}

Might as well write for today also!\n\nWe started our day with origami. It was a fun activity (if you can get past step 1.) I've done some origami over the years. It was a struggle a bit trying to build something. Not to bad after you get the hang of it.\n\nThen We had a leadership activity with Dr. Machida. It was really fun getting to know about Japan and Dr. Machida's experiences abroad at a young age. It really motivates me to study abroad!! :)\n\nI also learned how to use chopsticks. Who knew that it could be fun? It was a challenge none less.... Now I want to use them at any Chinese place.\n\nAfter Lunch We got to meet some of the students that have been on a study abroad program. Some went to the Czech Republic or Netherlands. They told us their crazy adventures. They also explained some struggles and surprises they experience. I felt like I related to them since I have also gone out of the country plenty of times. They really assured us that it is totally worth it.\n\nWe had some of the international students help us with calligraphy. They helped us all write our names in Japanese. This but also words that had a meaning to our own. I picked 'potential' and 'perseverance.' I say they did a great job . Props to you guys.\n\nThe chopsticks lesson came to great use!! We went to a Chinese restaurant. I ordered spicy chicken. Used my chopsticks to eat my entree. I felt like I succeeded at a life.\n\nLater everyone decided to take naps after a very busy day. I passed out on my bed, so did my roommate on his.\n\nI stayed up later to watch some funny movies... it was totally worth it :) :)\"", "label": "personal"}

Man I LOVE COLLEGE! Its music to my ears.\n\nInstead of being a lazy bum and staying in bed all day, I decided to spend my day outside in the good ol' Nebraska cold winter.

Examples of different cultures are the hispanic culture, italian, french, etc. Especially here at UNK we are more exposed than ever to different cultures.\n\nToday I want to talk about how people should be open minded and talk about how one should expose themselves too a different culture. Many of us who are small town people never really grew up with people of a different race or background. There is no harm in that. Once we all came to college we saw how diverse our world really is.. For me I've grown up in two cultures parallel to each other. I grew up in a very hispanic family while being born in to the American culture that I have known since the day I was born. So I could say that I am used to different cultures.\n\nThrough out our lives, we find people who are different from us in various ways. Different can mean being from another country. Being from a different country you have different aspects of the world. Being different is good. Those who are totally different from you are International Students.\n\nI say one should befriend an international student. Help them out. It would mean the world to them. You thought you were scared when you went off to college, they are probably three times as scared since they are in a country that they have never been in before. They will be greatful when you do help them. I know if you ever need a favor from them, they will gladly go up and beyond to help you suceed if you need help from them. It does not hurt to hangout with them. They will learn so much just being around you. You will as well. It is a win-win situation. Take them out to lunch sometime so you get to know them. They will gladly prepare a meal for you sometime. You may not think about it now but they could be of future help when needing to get a job, if they are already in the workforce.\n\nI love to learn about the other cultures. It fascinates me how different and similar cultures are. Me being the avid FOOD LOVER <3 I love to \"\"test\"\" new food for my belly to enjoy. I did not realize that I loved Japanese foodso much. I think that best part other than the insides is the seaweed to make some of them sushi entrees. NO one has anything to lose by opening themselves up to something different. You know what they say\n\nYOU NEVER KNOW UNTIL YOU TRY!\n\nI say go for it!\n\nWhile you can enjoy a culture festival. Here at UNK we have many of these. The most recent one I went to was the Japanese Food Festival. I learned so much about the Japanese culture. I got to see what their traditions truly embrace than just rely on stereotypes. I have made many Japanese friends as well. Being around theses students, you really get a one to one learning opportunity. It really teaches others not to be afraid and to always remember where one came from originally.\n\nThe food was great! Job well done to those in charge of the event. It was a one to remember. Who know it would of been SO much fun to make Japanese food. I want more! Someone hook me up!!\n\nMaybe I'll see you guys at the International Food Festival this Sunday!\n\nCheck out my gallery!!\n\n\"", "label": "personal"}

We travel, we work our butts off to have some financial gains and stability. What's that for a college kid? Summer is also a time to think ahead into the future while enjoying yourself. It is unfortunate that this this adventure is only temporary to help us get away. That being said, I am going to tell you about my summer adventures and what it entails. The summer is slowly slipping to the end...\n\nWorking is important to make money. That's exactly what I have done throughout the summer. For those who do not know, I work at McDonald's as a manager. It pays me well to let me go on adventures. (More on that in a second.) Like any job, it has it's ups and downs. Honestly I am surprised that I have stayed as long as I have. 5 years strong! WOO! Its a job that has many benefits than just the paycheck.\n\nSo now you want to know what I actually did for fun? Alright! One thing at a time.\n\nSo my first adventure was hitting the upper west coast! It was the trip trio: three friends, three places! We went to started our trip off in Denver to catch a flight out of DEN towards Seattle. Seattle was such a beautiful city. Then we crossed into Canada where we spend a few days in Vancouver, BC. Canada was breath taking. I was glad to see Canada for the first time. It was exciting to see one of my friends leave the country for the first time ever! I got to speak a little French here and there.\n\nCan always count on these guys to push me through anything! #summer #canada A photo posted by Pablo Morales (@pmorales18) on Jun 11, 2016 at 7:04pm PDT\n\nI went to Denver a second time recently to the Vans Warped Tour! This is my second year going to this I got to see some of my favorite bands this year! Many of you heard that Yellow Card is breaking up!! I about cried when I heard this. They have their reasons and I respect them for that. They have had such an impact on me.\n\nI got to hangout with friends all throughout. Frienships grew!\n\nThis is only a summary of my summer. Want to know? Just ask!\n\n-Pablo\"", "label": "personal"}
{"title": "Pablo Morales", "url": "https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/published:2016-08", "content": "en\n\n\"Junior year of college is the turning point of most people's education. It is the time where the most people are deep into their major. You know, the point where it seems too late to turn back. This is not the case for me.\n\nI've changed my major various times to in the last two years. It has not been the easiest process. In most cases it revolved around me jumping back and forth between different areas of science or healthcare related fields to humanities. Not deciding what I wanted in my life has had an effect on my greatly. Many friends know to what extent this led too. Thinking back on this tossing and turning made me realize how I truly did not have a passion for the sciences. You know what it really showed me? I am a person who is very stubborn. I was in denial. Deep down inside, there was no want for me to continue in the sciences. My mindset was not open to explore other options. I felt like a failure if I did not become something in the sciences or be something in healthcare. Avoiding disappointment and failure had become the way my life driving towards.\n\nThere comes a time where you have to wake up and come to reality that you really do not have interest in what you are shooting for after attempting various attempts. I should have followed my heart from the very beginning. My advice to you,\n\n\"\"Do not let anyone tell you what you should study. Only y0u know what you want in life.\"\"\n\nI did that mistake and did not follow my dreams right away. It took a lot of courage for me to stand up to myself. It is sort of shocking, huh? The mind is is your worst enemy. I am glad that I did what I did.\n\nNow I am following my passion. A passion that I have always known to have since the first time I took this class in high school. There is this a major sense of relief. I announce that I will fully commit to become a teacher and strive for what I feel that I will do best\n\nThank you for the support.\n\nWith much love,\n\nPablo Morales\n\n\"", "label": "personal"}

I enjoy the freedoms, living independently and eating good food whenever I want. Life has treated me good here. Until more recently, a certain stage of being away finally starts. Lately, homesickness has really started to kick in. I‚Äôve really started to miss my friends, family and things I really took for granted back home. It really is bad when I am craving my mom‚Äôs homemade food. (Mexican Food.) Midterms and all the studying is really killing my vibe at this point of the semester. My program is not your typical study abroad program that you go away for 3 months (not to mention that it doesn‚Äôt even apply to your major) on a semi vacation. I actually have to try real hard as my french studies here in Strasbourg France will help me graduate next year. Enough bashing.\n\nWith all this, one just feels that they are slowly losing control. Sure I am enjoying myself out here in France but still there is this emptiness of something that I have been away from for far too long. Hopefully, I hope some sort of enlightenment will come bring me back to life. Then It hit me, I would see my friends in just a few weeks. I honestly couldn‚Äôt believe in such short time I would be right in front of them.\n\nSo I would be meeting up my good friend Sammy and soon-to-be friend Mitch.

I also got to meet Mitch and got to know him more through out the weekend. Cool Dude! So I showed them around Paris. To be honest, Paris is beautiful with history written all around.

I really hope that the guys did not have too high of hopes for the ‚ÄúCity of Love.‚Äù Paris is overrated in my opinion but why not take advantage of leaving Strasbourg for a few days.\n\nSo we went to various monuments such as The Louvre, Arc of Triumph, Versailles and so much more. Many of the places were breath taking. The Eiffel Tour is always a good place to scope out as well as walking along the Seine River. Getting around Paris is no piece of cake but we managed. Never have I ever gone up so many round staircases. Climbing the Cathedral of Notre Dame was such a struggle. Whenever you are in Europe, walking is really the way to get around.\n\nNight life in Paris is pretty popping! We went to a few clubs in the Grand Boulevard District! This district did not disappoint. I wish we could have checked out a few other ones. One of my favorite places was the Irish Pub. Music, dancing, girls and drinks. Man was that a fun night!\n\nWe ate some good food throughout Paris. The guys had their first legit French Croissants and baguette sandwich. It‚Äôs totally acceptable to have a sandwich on you at all times. I also had them try one of my favorites, a kebab sandwich. Man are they delicious! Sammy had actual ramen noodles for the first time ever! Overall we pretty much stuffed our faces all weekend.\n\nBruxelles- Weekend 2\n\nAh Bruxelles!! The place known for its deliciouos fries and waffles. You have no idea how much I stuffed my face this weekend. Just writing this post makes my mouth water. Was eating all this food this worth it? You bet it was!! When I arrived in Bruxelles, it was gloomy and misting. Not the way I wanted to start the weekend. The weather stayed the same all weekend.

{"title": "Pablo Morales", "url": "https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/published:2017", "content": "en\n\nBeing away from home these last few months have been great. I enjoy the freedoms, living independently and eating good food whenever I want. Life has treated me good here. Until more recently, a certain stage of being away finally starts. Lately, homesickness has really started to kick in. I‚Äôve really started to miss my friends, family and things I really took for granted back home. It really is bad when I am craving my mom‚Äôs homemade food. (Mexican Food.) Midterms and all the studying is really killing my vibe at this point of the semester. My program is not your typical study abroad program that you go away for 3 months (not to mention that it doesn‚Äôt even apply to your major) on a semi vacation. I actually have to try real hard as my french studies here in Strasbourg France will help me graduate next year. Enough bashing.\n\nWith all this, one just feels that they are slowly losing control. Sure I am enjoying myself out here in France but still there is this emptiness of something that I have been away from for far too long. Hopefully, I hope some sort of enlightenment will come bring me back to life. Then It hit me, I would see my friends in just a few weeks. I honestly couldn‚Äôt believe in such short time I would be right in front of them.\n\nSo I would be meeting up my good friend Sammy and soon-to-be friend Mitch. They have never been to Europe before, so I figured why not show them around Paris, a city that I know decently and use my French to get to Point A to Point B and of course with the help of good ol‚Äô Google Maps. Paris- Weekend 1\n\nThese guys had a hell of a time getting to Paris during the 24 hours before arrival. I‚Äôll let them explain that one.\n\nSo I picked the guys up from Charles De Gaulle Aiport. I still feel bad on making you guys wait for me. :/ I ran up to my dude Sammy and gave him a bro hug! It has been way to long since I have seen that dude! I also got to meet Mitch and got to know him more through out the weekend. Cool Dude! So I showed them around Paris. To be honest, Paris is beautiful with history written all around. As with any major city, Paris is no exception, it is dirty and smelly. I really hope that the guys did not have too high of hopes for the ‚ÄúCity of Love.‚Äù Paris is overrated in my opinion but why not take advantage of leaving Strasbourg for a few days.\n\nSo we went to various monuments such as The Louvre, Arc of Triumph, Versailles and so much more. Many of the places were breath taking. The Eiffel Tour is always a good place to scope out as well as walking along the Seine River. Getting around Paris is no piece of cake but we managed. Never have I ever gone up so many round staircases. Climbing the Cathedral of Notre Dame was such a struggle. Whenever you are in Europe, walking is really the way to get around.\n\nNight life in Paris is pretty popping! We went to a few clubs in the Grand Boulevard District! This district did not disappoint. I wish we could have checked out a few other ones. One of my favorite places was the Irish Pub. Music, dancing, girls and drinks. Man was that a fun night!\n\nWe ate some good food throughout Paris. The guys had their first legit French Croissants and baguette sandwich. It‚Äôs totally acceptable to have a sandwich on you at all times. I also had them try one of my favorites, a kebab sandwich. Man are they delicious! Sammy had actual ramen noodles for the first time ever! Overall we pretty much stuffed our faces all weekend.\n\nBruxelles- Weekend 2\n\nAh Bruxelles!! The place known for its deliciouos fries and waffles. You have no idea how much I stuffed my face this weekend. Just writing this post makes my mouth water. Was eating all this food this worth it? You bet it was!! When I arrived in Bruxelles, it was gloomy and misting. Not the way I wanted to start the weekend. The weather stayed the same all weekend. That did not stop the fun.\n\nSpending the weekend in Brussels was totally worth the waffles! The sugar definitely made me bounce off the walls. #belgium #worldtravel #unkstudyabroad A post shared by Pablo Morales (@pablo.morales1) on Mar 19, 2017 at 9:55am PDT\n\nWe checked out many popular attractions throughout the city. There was so much we saw, I started to lose my mind a bit. One of the coolest places I saw was a ‚ÄúWorld Shop.‚Äù They had souvenirs and artsy things from all around the world. I was so intrigued with the place that I ended up buying a few things from there.\n\nThe other purpose of coming to Bruxelles was to meet up with our friend Kellie and Sammy‚Äôs brother, Louis. It was good to see some other friends from back home. I missed those two! Kellie is just a keeper, to keep a long story short. These two are actually on Spring Break right now.

Getting the insights from another teacher lets you have a feeling of what its like to be in the classroom. Enjoy the interview! I will have the audio podcast available soon! Click here to download a copy of the document to your device.\n\nDenise Teetor: ESL at Hastings Senior High School\n\nInterviewed by\n\nPablo MORALES GARCIA\n\nMrs. Denise Teetor is an English as a Second Language Teacher at Hastings Senior High School in Hastings Nebraska. She has been teaching at the high school for more than 30 years. She has quite a different perspective of the world since she has traveled outside of the United States plenty of times. She has seen so many changes in ESL over the years. She has quite the story to tell in which she becomes the ESL teacher she is today.\n\nMrs. Teetor was not an ESL teacher from the beginning. She use to teach physical education and coach for a long time. She decided to pursue a different area of teaching and left behind being an PE teacher and decided to teach English in Japan. She wanted to do something different with her time during the summers instead of wasting it. She saw an advertisement to teach in Japan for six weeks and thought ‚Äúthat sounds pretty cool‚Äù, and that‚Äôs how she got involved with Japan. She really enjoyed it and had so much fun with it.\n\nAfter one summer, she decided to pursue her ESL endorsements. She was thinking ahead that she could teach ESL at the high school level at some point down the road. One summer as she was getting ready to go back to Japan, she knew that the ELL teacher at Hastings High would be leaving that summer, even though she had not filed her resignation letter. Mrs. Teetor took some steps before the other teacher quit. She let the school know that she was interested in the position. The teacher did end up leaving and she received a phone call asking if she was interested in the ELL position and she said ‚ÄúYes‚Äù. This is how she moved from physical education to ELL. Japan really peaked her interest working with foreign kids.\n\nShe is happy with how much ESL/ELL has evolved over the years, especially since she saw there was not a lot of curriculum that existed. The number of students has changed over the years. The program development has come a long way. There was curriculum that really existed. They were fortunate when they were able to find books related to ELL/ESL. Now there are whole curriculums that one can use. That has been an advancement of ELL programs. It is like all other curriculums in schools such as science where you have books, notebooks and a foundation to use. You start at the foundational levels and move through the different stages of it. It has been one of the biggest tools available so teachers don‚Äôt have to go out and make their own material.\n\nShe describes the program at Hastings Senior High School. She gets all different levels of ESL students in each class period. She explains that in an ideal world, students are grouped by their level such as all level 1 students are together, level 2 are together, and so forth. Unfortunately, she doesn‚Äôt have that luxury at the high school. She works with each level of students individually so each group of students can be differentiated as needed. She splits the groups up between her and Mrs. Brenneman, the para educator, to help each leveled group. The program at HHS is not a program that is like those implemented in other schools. The program isn‚Äôt a dual language or other type. They just work based on the situation they have or a melting pot as she states. She is very proud of the graduation rate that has increased. If the kids start with the program, they tend to finish with the program unless they move away. She is proud that the ELL students have been able to take all the required classes or core classes needed to graduate. Even though they might not have a high level of English, ‚Äúthey do pretty well‚Äù. Even though teachers provide differentiation, they learn all the same material as regular students. The students are able to get into the classroom right away. This is good for them since they can get ‚Äúreal world‚Äù experience and immerse themselves in the culture and listen to how students talk. No one ever follows grammar rules when the speak.\n\nMrs. Teetor mentions that students have to take a test to see if they need ESL services based on responses on intake forms when transferring into the district. She uses the newly implemented ELPA to screen prospective and current students who might or are using ESL services to measure their level of English. Newly arriving students fill out a questionnaire that askes the language they spoke first, what language is spoken primarily at home, and what language they want to be communicated with. If any of these are not English, they need to be tested. Even though a student knows English, they still have to take the test if their language spoken at home is not English. She uses a computer screener test. Anyone that is four (4) or above, they do not need to be in the program but anything below that, students should be enrolled in ESL/ELL. Things are done differently at the elementary level compared to the high school level.\n\nMrs. Teetor works closely with other teachers. She also likes to know what the teachers are teaching so she can meet the needs of students such as preparing a presentation or report. With American History, the students have no background especially with the foreign students. American history pertains to the United States. Math is math, science is science, these things are the same all the way across cultures. She enjoys how things are taught at HHS. Students are in ELL for at least 2 class periods. She tells us about an example student who doesn‚Äôt speak a lot of but is very bright. Looking at her transcripts, she is a very well-rounded person. She has taken courses in psychology to advanced math. She was top of her class before moving. This student is ‚Äúbrilliant‚Äù, according to Mrs. Teetor. She sees how this student can feel out of place due to the language barrier. She sees another barrier with math leaning towards story-problems. It intimidates students since it involves reading instead of involving direct math problems. What is truly moving is that she truly advocates for students to get them in the regular classroom where they will have to think, perform in the real thing. She knows it will be hard but it would be a ‚Äúdisservice‚Äù if she does not.\n\nShe hasn‚Äôt faced any teachers who have rejected or negated students. This at least hasn‚Äôt occurred during her time her but she says that ‚Äúit might have happened before I started.‚Äù She believes this hasn‚Äôt happened because of her strong personality and she knows the teachers will be supportive at Hastings Senior High School. She hopes that the next person who replaces her will continue on standing up for the students. She also knows which teachers will be best for her students and she know the teachers who will not be a good fit. She moves students as necessary to put them in the right classrooms. She would rather do something else with the student if the teacher is not a good fit for the students. For a new teacher, this is something that he or she will not know and this will take time to figure out. She is hopeful the other teacher will be the best advocate for the ESL students.\n\nShe has great advice for new ESL teachers especially for the teacher replacing her. The best advice would be just to have fun with these students. They do need to learn but also everything is not so rigid that they can‚Äôt enjoy. Simply cramming information gets them discouraged. It has been interested and fun for them to know. Everyone has some kid within each other. We need to promote this with the kids. She gets a lot out of the kids when they have fun. If they are sitting bored, they are not going anywhere. This is her overall advice.\n\nThank you, Mrs. Teetor for allowing me to interview you. It was such a great insight of ESL and very helpful for me for my future career as an ESL Teacher. I wish you the best in luck with retirement and hope to hear about your adventures in Japan! Cheers!\n\nA podcast of this will be available on my SoundCloud page soon!", "label": "personal"}

He has come a long way from living in Wyoming to going to school in Nebraska. He decided to take a different route and packed his things and moved to Los Angeles. I am really excited for the great things he is doing to become \"\"different\"\" and not living a normal life. He tells us about his journey and some tips to do more in life. I see great things for you Jack!\n\nPablo: Jack tell me about yourself?\n\nJack: Where to start? My name is Jack Corbett, 22 years old. I am from Madison, WI. I've always been a kid who has been in love with sports his whole life. The only thing I really wanted to do was to play football in NFL. That all changed when I got a concussion after my third year in college playing football. Things really changed after this. The concussion was very eye opening for me. I felt so messed up and out if it. I decided to take another route after football.\n\nP: What gave you that spark to get you into music?\n\nJ: When I was in high school I took a Hip-Hop class studies. I did a freestyle rap in class on the spot. Alongside I had used a beat production program, also referred as a digital audio workstation. Everyone had to present and the class had to pick their favorite beat that they liked. They ended up choosing mine. Everyone really seemed to love it! It got me super pumped. The feedback I got was good. Music is about impressing your fans. Might as well do it and I just love it. That‚Äôs simply how it is. At first when starting out, I did not take music production seriously. I had always wanted to be different in how I wanted my life to be ‚ÄúHow could I be different from the typical 9 to 5 lifestyle?‚Äù Music was the way to go to do this. I turned this around and I created an independent record label, [NAME?] Records.\n\nJ: I started modeling when I got to to Los Angeles. I decided to do an open call audition for Maverick Modeling in LA. After I had done my audtion, they were interested in me but I needed to fix a few things to get things going. They wanted me to get more in shape. I had to workout quite a bit and check in with them every week for 4 weeks. Then it really worked out.\n\nP: What kind of modeling or related jobs have you had so far?\n\nJ: Oh, man! I've had a few jobs so far! I've been doing stuff with H&M, commercials, print & digital publications and some things in YouTube. Everything counts! I've had so much fun!\n\nP: How did you build contacts and/or clients?\n\nJ: The agency handles modeling projects (business aspect) for me to do. I hired a photographer that I met through a few friends. [She] is from London. I have met people from back home. You meet so many people in LA. Making beats, you get to know other people as well. I have met with a new group of rappers called FRIO. I have also made friends with Ponts De Leon. He is really making it out here. I got to hangout in his studio. Then I checked out Altrium Sudios and met label executive, Quincy Howard. I've been back there a few times with some rapper friends and Quincy has been there every time. Through meeting him and liking my vibe. I got an interview to be an intern. Today is my third day here. I am really loving every minute of it I'm grateful for all of the people I've met so far.\n\nP: What was the biggest challenge moving to this new place that you call home?\n\nJ: My biggest challenge would be financials. Everything out here is just much more expensive in every aspect Getting to LA was something else I rode for 30 hours in about 2 days. I had around 10 hours of rest before I had to start my new job Monday morning. Now I have a car. I didn‚Äôt have a car for six months. I made it though LA was a bit shocking for me. It was over stimulating to be here at first. It's just different from what I was used to.\n\nP: What gave you the motivation to stay with it?\n\nJ: There would be a lot of days just sitting in your room. It is really hard to stay motivated. I love producing music! Sometimes I would be bored out of my mind not being able to show anyone my beats. It is seriously a good time even if I am by myself. At the same time, It is addicting like a video game. Sometimes I can't stop. As you get better, it is all about time. More people start to notice once you start getting better. I have so much more fun when I feel confident that I am getting better.\n\nP: Did you have any doubts in your mind that you were not going to be successful?\n\nJ: Everyone has lots of ups and down that they face. You never know when something crazy might happen!? A variety of things can make you question yourself. Things like when no one is buying your beats or not getting calls for audtions. Football has taught me to work hard. I just don't give up! I can't. .\"", "label": "personal"}

She knows it will be hard but it would be a ‚Äúdisservice‚Äù if she does not.\n\nShe hasn‚Äôt faced any teachers who have rejected or negated students. This at least hasn‚Äôt occurred during her time her but she says that ‚Äúit might have happened before I started.‚Äù She believes this hasn‚Äôt happened because of her strong personality and she knows the teachers will be supportive at Hastings Senior High School. She hopes that the next person who replaces her will continue on standing up for the students. She also knows which teachers will be best for her students and she know the teachers who will not be a good fit. She moves students as necessary to put them in the right classrooms. She would rather do something else with the student if the teacher is not a good fit for the students. For a new teacher, this is something that he or she will not know and this will take time to figure out. She is hopeful the other teacher will be the best advocate for the ESL students.\n\nShe has great advice for new ESL teachers especially for the teacher replacing her. The best advice would be just to have fun with these students. They do need to learn but also everything is not so rigid that they can‚Äôt enjoy. Simply cramming information gets them discouraged. It has been interested and fun for them to know. Everyone has some kid within each other. We need to promote this with the kids. She gets a lot out of the kids when they have fun. If they are sitting bored, they are not going anywhere. This is her overall advice.\n\nThank you, Mrs. Teetor for allowing me to interview you. It was such a great insight of ESL and very helpful for me for my future career as an ESL Teacher. I wish you the best in luck with retirement and hope to hear about your adventures in Japan!

Getting the insights from another teacher lets you have a feeling of what its like to be in the classroom. Enjoy the interview! I will have the audio podcast available soon! Click here to download a copy of the document to your device.\n\nDenise Teetor: ESL at Hastings Senior High School\n\nInterviewed by\n\nPablo MORALES GARCIA\n\nMrs. Denise Teetor is an English as a Second Language Teacher at Hastings Senior High School in Hastings Nebraska. She has been teaching at the high school for more than 30 years. She has quite a different perspective of the world since she has traveled outside of the United States plenty of times. She has seen so many changes in ESL over the years. She has quite the story to tell in which she becomes the ESL teacher she is today.\n\nMrs. Teetor was not an ESL teacher from the beginning. She use to teach physical education and coach for a long time. She decided to pursue a different area of teaching and left behind being an PE teacher and decided to teach English in Japan. She wanted to do something different with her time during the summers instead of wasting it. She saw an advertisement to teach in Japan for six weeks and thought ‚Äúthat sounds pretty cool‚Äù, and that‚Äôs how she got involved with Japan. She really enjoyed it and had so much fun with it.\n\nAfter one summer, she decided to pursue her ESL endorsements. She was thinking ahead that she could teach ESL at the high school level at some point down the road. One summer as she was getting ready to go back to Japan, she knew that the ELL teacher at Hastings High would be leaving that summer, even though she had not filed her resignation letter. Mrs. Teetor took some steps before the other teacher quit. She let the school know that she was interested in the position. The teacher did end up leaving and she received a phone call asking if she was interested in the ELL position and she said ‚ÄúYes‚Äù. This is how she moved from physical education to ELL. Japan really peaked her interest working with foreign kids.\n\nShe is happy with how much ESL/ELL has evolved over the years, especially since she saw there was not a lot of curriculum that existed. The number of students has changed over the years. The program development has come a long way. There was curriculum that really existed. They were fortunate when they were able to find books related to ELL/ESL. Now there are whole curriculums that one can use. That has been an advancement of ELL programs. It is like all other curriculums in schools such as science where you have books, notebooks and a foundation to use. You start at the foundational levels and move through the different stages of it. It has been one of the biggest tools available so teachers don‚Äôt have to go out and make their own material.\n\nShe describes the program at Hastings Senior High School. She gets all different levels of ESL students in each class period. She explains that in an ideal world, students are grouped by their level such as all level 1 students are together, level 2 are together, and so forth. Unfortunately, she doesn‚Äôt have that luxury at the high school. She works with each level of students individually so each group of students can be differentiated as needed. She splits the groups up between her and Mrs. Brenneman, the para educator, to help each leveled group. The program at HHS is not a program that is like those implemented in other schools. The program isn‚Äôt a dual language or other type. They just work based on the situation they have or a melting pot as she states. She is very proud of the graduation rate that has increased. If the kids start with the program, they tend to finish with the program unless they move away. She is proud that the ELL students have been able to take all the required classes or core classes needed to graduate. Even though they might not have a high level of English, ‚Äúthey do pretty well‚Äù. Even though teachers provide differentiation, they learn all the same material as regular students. The students are able to get into the classroom right away. This is good for them since they can get ‚Äúreal world‚Äù experience and immerse themselves in the culture and listen to how students talk. No one ever follows grammar rules when the speak.\n\nMrs. Teetor mentions that students have to take a test to see if they need ESL services based on responses on intake forms when transferring into the district. She uses the newly implemented ELPA to screen prospective and current students who might or are using ESL services to measure their level of English. Newly arriving students fill out a questionnaire that askes the language they spoke first, what language is spoken primarily at home, and what language they want to be communicated with. If any of these are not English, they need to be tested. Even though a student knows English, they still have to take the test if their language spoken at home is not English. She uses a computer screener test. Anyone that is four (4) or above, they do not need to be in the program but anything below that, students should be enrolled in ESL/ELL. Things are done differently at the elementary level compared to the high school level.\n\nMrs. Teetor works closely with other teachers. She also likes to know what the teachers are teaching so she can meet the needs of students such as preparing a presentation or report. With American History, the students have no background especially with the foreign students. American history pertains to the United States. Math is math, science is science, these things are the same all the way across cultures. She enjoys how things are taught at HHS. Students are in ELL for at least 2 class periods. She tells us about an example student who doesn‚Äôt speak a lot of but is very bright. Looking at her transcripts, she is a very well-rounded person. She has taken courses in psychology to advanced math. She was top of her class before moving. This student is ‚Äúbrilliant‚Äù, according to Mrs. Teetor. She sees how this student can feel out of place due to the language barrier. She sees another barrier with math leaning towards story-problems. It intimidates students since it involves reading instead of involving direct math problems. What is truly moving is that she truly advocates for students to get them in the regular classroom where they will have to think, perform in the real thing. She knows it will be hard but it would be a ‚Äúdisservice‚Äù if she does not.\n\nShe hasn‚Äôt faced any teachers who have rejected or negated students. This at least hasn‚Äôt occurred during her time her but she says that ‚Äúit might have happened before I started.‚Äù She believes this hasn‚Äôt happened because of her strong personality and she knows the teachers will be supportive at Hastings Senior High School. She hopes that the next person who replaces her will continue on standing up for the students. She also knows which teachers will be best for her students and she know the teachers who will not be a good fit. She moves students as necessary to put them in the right classrooms.

These posts will be interactive on my website (https://lifeofpablo.com) . I am in the process of rebuilding my website so stay tuned.\n\nHere I am in South Korea getting a snack at a convenience store. Everytime I go to one, I reflect on convenience stores back in the United States. Convenience stores in the United States are usually gas stations at the same time. Living in California you see convenience stores as standalone locations more often. Convenience stores back home get a bad wrap because they sell not so healthy food or are simply over priced. It's not so much in Korea. Yes, there are things that are overpriced but not as bad as you would see in the United States. Korean Convenience Stores are a whole different experience..\n\n‚ô•Ô∏èKOREA IS LIVING IN THE FUTURE‚ô•Ô∏è\n\nCommon convenience stores are GS25, Nice to CU and 7/11. They are all over the place. It's hard not to walk from one corner of a block to another corner of the same block without passing a convenience store. This is pretty consistent in most of Korea. The cities of Seoul and Chuncheon are good examples. Two or three years since the pandemic, many did stay open pretty late or open 24 hours. They are just there whenever you need something. You can buy a snack, a beer (or many), toiletries and more! I've even found socks after my shoes got soaked in the rain. Prices are not overly expensive taking in consideration that the exchange rate between USD and WON are in the favor of the American consumer such as myself.\n\nThe experience at every convenience store is different. You never know what you'll find. I'm not sure how it is decided on what is carried in each store. I do love the element of surprise.\n\nKorean Convenience Stores will fill the void in many aspects of life. They are considered important in Korean Culture and Socialization. You'll often find tables inside and outside of the store. I find it hard to find a normal bar establishment. Even if I did find a bar, it could be expensive or hard to get into. Convenience Stores are a meeting point to socialize especially if there is seating available at the location you visit. I really enjoy getting a beer or a few with friends and just talk about our day, our hopes & desires, and just having tipy conversations. I've had some really deep moments here with others. One of my favorite moments was finding a convenience store in a large park and making my ramen right then and there!\n\nWhat really shocked me was the Seoul WorldCup Stadium when I went to a soccer match. There I found a GS25 with prices similar to one you find on a random street.\n\nOverall, I'm happy with convenience stores here! I sure will miss them!\n\nI will share this information in a lesson in the near future with others.\n\nHere are my favorite items I get from the convenience store:\n\nSmall pack of coffee\n\nA cup of ice - use it for any drink you need to make cold (or colder.)\n\nGimbap\n\nBeer\n\nRam\n\nSnacks such as fried\n\nRamen\n\nWhat is nice about convenience stores is being able to cook instant ramen in-store seconds right after you buy it.\n\nSnacks\n\nThere are so many options.

When I mean joined, I actually created my own Mastodon instance on my server. More on this later. So for I am loving the decentralized platform and being able to control various aspects to it. My first experience with federation was the use of OwnCloud and its variants such as NextCloud. This concept has been around for quite some time.\n\nI chose to host my own instance because I like my domain (lifeofpablo.com) and it gave me an opportunity to learn how to manage an instance and learn how to be a user as well. It's been a great experience. If there is question or something I don't know I visit the Mastodon Documentation . This where the instructions are located to install your own instance.

These apps would be an extension to my Mastodon instance. I'd use the login system to login to these apps to pull and use data. Steps Use Mastodon as backend for authentication\n\nBuild Node.js app using Mastodon (oAuth) as a login system for an internal app. A tutorial I found for good foundation\n\nCreate a dashboard where I can see metrics, trends, push system wide notifications, server maintenance, etc. Essentially a backend management.\n\nMove many of the administration features to the dashboard with the option of allowing features to be available.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt's been great getting to use Mastodon on the server-side and as a user. I see a great future for Mastodon and other decentralized, federated services (and other terminology) out there.\n\nI'm sure my goals/vision will grow on what I can do with my Mastodon instance. I know I will eventually migrate and upgrade server resources such as RAM, storage, processing power. I also need to make sure I concious about how much energy and being carbon neutral or carbon negative.\n\nIntroduction Post", "label": "personal"}

These posts will be interactive on my website (https://lifeofpablo.com) . I am in the process of rebuilding my website so stayed tuned.\n\nMy name is Pablo Morales. I used to teach within Omaha Public Schools but now I teach in Sacramento, CA. I still teach French & Spanish to middle schoolers.\n\nI have always been a fan of public transportation! Within the United States, commuting to work seems painfully dreadful. We are a nation dominated by cars and bad policies. Our public transportation infrastructure is not good for a very ‚Äúdeveloped‚Äù country. Our roads are suffering, and everything else in-between isn‚Äôt pleasant either. This isn't the case in South Korea. I'm only a week or so in since arriving in South Korea. I am absolutely M-I-N-D blown on what I am seeing and hearing.. My brain can't handle this!\n\nCommuting in Seoul, Korea is not about trying to catch your bus or train, you are there for the experience of being in a station. You're probably wondering, \"Pablo, Isn't the topic over public transportation‚Ä¶.you know boring?\" I say, \"Absolutely Not!\" I've been to multiple cities who don't even come close to the Korean experience of public transportation. My favorite part about using the Seoul Metro System is that you get to hear all the cute and relaxing rings and jingles offered at all metro stations and some bus stations.\n\nCommuting is hard on the body when traveling far. It's hot and humid out, or you're just simply tired. Those little jingles give you a glimmer of hope that you are getting closer to your final destination. You stay motivated instead of only hearing the usual \"This train is departing.\" or departing. It brightens the mood. My two favorite jingles or sounds are: The Trumpet Link A steelpan Link Do you see what I mean? It definitely made me smile. Everyone seems so happy. I knew traveling within Seoul was going to be fun but who knew these little jingles are what make the experience of the metro in Seoul.\n\nHere is a handpicked few of my favorite jingles. Not all are in circulation at the moment.\n\nLink\n\nLink\n\nBeing a minority in the US and still being a minority in South Korea.\n\nSomeone who speaks 3 different languages. Learning the Korean language is easy in some aspects and difficult in others. I teach French & Spanish. The one common thing between these two languages is the alphabet - romanized letters. The Korean Language is written in Hangul.\n\nI was an ELL student. Even. I now understand what it is like to be in my student‚Äôs mind.", "label": "personal"}

{"title": "Public Education in Nebraska", "url": "https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/public-education-in-nebraska", "content": "Public Education in Nebraska\n\nThis post was written in English (en_US).\n\nIn ResponseGetting creative to do good in politics by Tracy Durnell\n\nI'll keep this brief.\n\nEducation is very important me. Education has been ingrained in me I was the first to graduate in my family from university. I studied to become a public school teacher. I became a public school teacher early in my career. I taught during the COVID pandemic during my first year of becoming a public school teacher.\n\nPublic school education is important to me.\n\nIt makes me sad to see what Nebraska, my home state, has become regarding public education. Now that I live in California, I feel, indirectly, I am standing on the sidelines seeing how my home-sate wants to divert public funds or public taxes to fund private institutions. We live in a time where we can't properly fund, nor respect our own public schools across the nation. The de-funding public schools has been in the works as far back as the 1980s. Other efforts happened before this as well. This has been most predominantly since the Reagan Administration. The Reagan Administration slashed funding for public education across the board.\n\nIt's embarrassing we are trying to divert money from a great public school system from the State of Nebraska as it ranks one of the highest in the nation. I myself am a product of a Nebraska Public Education. We need to fix the issues happening, not make the problems worse.\n\nWhy should we fund private institutions? Why should we fund religious public institutions? Shouldn't we have separation of church and state? Public funds should stay in public schools. It's like they are trying to make a problem worse? Why keep under funding the public school system?\n\nNone of the private schools in my hometown, offered the subjects I was interested. I lived not too far from a Catholic school. They offered the \"bare minimum.\" They didn't offer other world languages beyond Spanish. They didn't offer auto mechanics or other trades (attending trade school is just as important as university. This is discussion for another time.) What is the likelihood of them expanding their programs?\n\nMany counties in Nebraska don't even have private institutions. How is the state going to give private institutions money to education students when the facilities don't exist? Here's a news report\n\nPrivate education will increase inequality.\n\nPublic schools have been there for everyone. No matter your socioeconomic status. It was there for me. Public schools are there to help the most disadvantaged.\n\nI agree, with the phrase, \"Society is cheaping out on the kids\" as written by Tracy Durnell, \"We must fight the privatisation of school to provide racial equity, class mobility, and teaching reality instead of ‚Äòalternative facts.\" We need to invest in students and not let them down.\n\nHow the State Currently get funding\n\nNebraska Public Media does a great job, visually of reporting how schools are funded in Nebraska.\n\nGraphic from Nebraska Public Media: Nebraska relies heavily on property taxes to fund its public schools, compared to other states. (Graphic courtesy of OpenSky Policy Institute, uses 2019-2020 data\n\nMore state funding on the way for public schools in Nebraska\n\nAdding funding to public schools is only one piece of the puzzle, we need to also address the systems, bureaucracies, institutions, and bad polices that exist, past and present.\n\nI don't like to be cynical, I am scared what is coming. People need to become informed in what is happening in their community. People need to read the bills introduced in their respective level of government.

{"title": "Configuring Vouch Proxy with Indieauth", "url": "https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/configuring-vouch-proxy-with-indieauth", "content": "Location: 38.581573, -121.494400\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIntroduction\n\nA few months ago, I wrote a blog post on Vouch Proxy using Google as an idP, or Identity provider. This time I will be writing on how to configure vouch proxy to use indieAuth as the idP.\n\nThis blog post will be very similar to the blog post mentioned above but we will focus on indieAuth.\n\nToday, I'll demonstrate how to setup Vouch Proxy on an nginx web server. In this example I will be using IndieAuth as our provider using a very minimal configuration.\n\nThis tutorial assumes you have prior knowledge of using a linux server such as Debian. Message me at hello@lifeofpablo.com if you need some help. I'd be happy to do so!\n\nUse Cases\n\nI currently use it for: * Signing into my website * Using it for my guestbook * Sign into my RSS feeder. * Using same cookie on my website. Similar to single sign on.\n\nWhat Vouch Proxy Does?\n\nAccording to the Repository README.md, it states the following:\n\nVouch Proxy (VP) forces visitors to login and authenticate with an IdP (such as one of the services listed above) before allowing them access to a website.\n\nVP can also be used as a Single Sign On (SSO) solution to protect all web applications in the same domain.\n\nAfter a visitor logs in Vouch Proxy allows access to the protected websites for several hours. Every request is checked by VP to ensure that it is valid.\n\nVP can send the visitor's email, name and other information which the IdP provides (including access tokens) to the web application as HTTP headers. VP can be used to replace application user management entirely. In our case, we are passing an HTTP header with your domain to sign into sites that support indieauth protocol.\n\nAn example of an HTTP header being passed is my domain, https://lifeofpablo.com.\n\nThings you'll need/prepare:\n\nA linux server with a public IP address with hosting and SSL Debian will be used here but any of the common distros will work Certbot is an easy solution to get SSL certifcate for https://\n\nGo Language (to compile vouch-proxy)\n\nVouch Proxy\n\nMake sure your website is setup for use with the Indieauth protocol.\n\nNginx Web Server\n\nDigital Ocean has a good guide if you need to learn how to setup virtual blocks in nginx.\n\nDownload/Install Vouch Proxy from Github\n\nMake sure to have Go Lang installed. Follow the instructions for your operating system. In my case I am using debian.\n\nDownload Vouch Proxy from it's Github repository.\n\n$ git clone https://github.com/vouch/vouch-proxy.git $ cd vouch-proxy $ ./do.sh goget $ ./do.sh build\n\nVouch Proxy Nginx Virtual Block\n\nLet's go ahead and create a virtual block to proxy Vouch Proxy.\n\nserver { server_name vouch.domain.com; location / { proxy_set_header Host $http_host ; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https; proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9090; } }\n\nLet's go ahead and create a virtual block for a regular nginx website site or edit an existing virtual block. This is the website/service that you will protect with Vouch Proxy.\n\nIn this example I am using a php web app. If you a non php site site to work you can remove this location block and and edit it to your needs.\n\nVouch Proxy config with Indieauth.com as a service provider.\n\nModify your config.yml\n\nThis will get you going, I have added some of my personal settings such as public access. Public access allows people to access your \"protected app\" without needing to login until you need them to login. Here are some options in how you can allow people to use your app. It is important to align the config in the config.yml file. Even an extra space can cause Vouch Proxy to fail. More on that in the next section.\n\nOptions\n\nYou can allow public access to the site but only allow everyone the option to sign into the website with a basic PHP script or use the corresponding http_header to use the website/web app to authenticate . Comment out or delete the line, \"allowAllUsers: true\" and include the line,\" publicAccess: true\" .\n\nYou can allow public access to the site but only allow certain people, (or in this case, domains) actually sign into the website. Comment out or delete the line, \"allowAllUsers: true\" and include the line,\" publicAccess: true\" .\n\nYou can force everyone to sign in before seeing the website but still allow everyone to access the website. Include the \"allowAllUsers: true\" and comment out or delete the line,,\" publicAccess: true\" .\n\n\n\nvouch: logLevel: debug listen: 0.0 .0 .0 port: 9090 allowAllUsers: true cookie: secure: false domain: lifeofpablo.com publicAccess: true oauth: provider: indieauth client_id: https://lifeofpablo.com auth_url: https://indieauth.com/auth callback_url: https://auth.lifeofpablo.com/auth\n\nRun/test your Vouch Proxy configuration.\n\nRun the following command\n\nnohup ./vouch-proxy -loglevel debug > vouch.log 2>&1 &\n\nIt should display a process ID (PID)\n\n[1] 53310\n\nHit enter. If no error or exit code displays, Vouch proxy is running!\n\nIf there is an error, it will exit such as the example below.\n\n[1]+ Exit 126 nohup ./vouch-proxy -loglevel debug > vouch.log 2>&1\n\nIf there is an error, make sure your there is not weird spacing or errors in the configuration. If you are sure that you have the information correct, use the examples provided by Vouch Proxy and copy and paste the example to get the formatting correct. Adjust the configuration as needed to match your needs.\n\nNginx Virtual block protected by Vouch Proxy\n\nserver { listen 80 ; listen [::]: 80 ; root /root/to/web/directory; index index.php index.html; server_name secretapp.example.com; location / { try_files $uri $uri / /index.php $is_args $args ; } client_max_body_size 100m ; location ~* \\.php$ { try_files $uri = 404 ; fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.2-fpm.sock; include fastcgi.conf; fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\\.php)(/.+)$ ; fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root $fastcgi_script_name ; fastcgi_param REMOTE_USER $auth_user ; } auth_request /vouch-validate; location = /vouch-validate { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:9090/validate; proxy_set_header Content-Length \"\" ; proxy_set_header Host $http_host ; proxy_set_header Remote-User $auth_user ; proxy_pass_request_body off ; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr ; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for ; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme ; auth_request_set $auth_resp_jwt $upstream_http_x_vouch_jwt ; auth_request_set $auth_resp_err $upstream_http_x_vouch_err ; auth_request_set $auth_resp_failcount $upstream_http_x_vouch_failcount ; } auth_request_set $auth_user $upstream_http_x_vouch_user ; location = /logout { return 302 https://vouch.domain.com/logout?url= $scheme :// $http_host ; } error_page 401 = @error401 ; location @error401 { return 302 https://vouch.domain.com/login?url=https:// $http_host $request_uri &vouch-failcount= $auth_resp_failcount &X-Vouch-Token= $auth_resp_jwt &error= $auth_resp_err ; } }\n\nEventually you will need to secure your site with SSL/TLS that makes your site use https://. More than ever, your traffic should be secure with using it as 0auth as the method used to sign in to your protected website(s).\n\nDo this after you have the server blocks working in the following section.\n\nHere is the link for Certbot for Debian. I have tested this on Debian 10 & 11.

It'll add these blocks in your server blocks automatically.\n\nIt'll look similar to this . Certbot will rearrange and add a few things.\n\nserver { server_name vouch.example.com . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . listen [::]: 443 ssl; listen 443 ssl; ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/vouch.example.com/fullchain.pem; ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/vouch.example.com/privkey.pem; include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; } server { if ( $host = vouch.domain.com) { return 301 https:// $host $request_uri ; } listen 80 ; listen [::]: 80 ; server_name secretapp.example.com; return 404 ; }\n\nRepeat for every server block you'd like protect.\n\nLet's check for errors in nginx. Type the following command.\n\nsudo nginx -t\n\nYou should see something similar to this:\n\nnginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful\n\nThen restart nginx to push changes.\n\nsudo systemctl restart nginx\n\nLet's open a browser tab or window!\n\nNote: I'm using Firefox.

Then, depending on whether you use fastcgi or proxy_pass, include one of the two lines below in your server block:\n\nfastcgi_param REMOTE_USER $auth_user ; proxy_set_header Remote-User $auth_user ;\n\nThese will set an HTTP header with the value of $auth_user that your backend server can read in order to know who logged in.

I have used it one or twice through out the years. My first time being in 2015. I was so opposed or timid in the use of using Docker. I was so used to doing things the \"hard way\" otherwise known as manual install. So My friend Mani, has been showing me his Kubernetes setup and talking about Docker. I thought it was pretty rad! Just the way things flowed and how easy it is to stop and start a container. This is something he has started for a while. I hope to become well versed in this.\n\nThis leads to what is mentioned in the title of this post. I am in the process of learning to understand containers, Kubernetes, miniKube, docker and how this all ties together. I'll start with Docker and learn Kubernetes side-by-side and hope to understand. The goal is to containerize all my websites and services to keep up with the times and become a better developer.\n\nMy first successful implementation of a docker container was, wait for it..... Can you guess what it is? If you guessed Vouch Proxy! You win an cookie üç™! Hooray! For the record, not a browser cookie. Those are not tasty or pleasing.\n\nIt was pretty simple once I figured out how to run the commands to adjust to my needs. I used my existing configuration file for Vouch Proxy but with some redactions. So, if you are seeing this post, or signed into my website, vouch proxy is running on docker!\n\nNext step is my website which runs on php and uses Datenstrom Yellow as the flat-file cms.\n\nI am excited for this new phase of my developer life.

I have always had an interest in taking pictures. I am one of those millennials who had a flip phone. For those who didn't have to live through this, flip phones did not have good cameras what's so ever. Phones were not all-in-one like today. So I had to bring my camera with me everywhere in my pocket or on my wrist all the time to get a good shot.\n\nPhotography has been a hobby of mine for a while. I've done it on and off throughout the years. It is a good outlet for me. It started with a point and shoot and eventually, I got nicer DSLR camera. I recently in the last two or three. years started with analog photography. Both, film photography and analog format videos. It's been fun crossing over different mediums. Photography makes me happy. I do my best to capture the moment and keep that moment alive. It is a capture of a moment of time. It's mind-blowing we can literally capture a moment and stare at it forever.\n\nIt is so much more meaningful to take it on a real camera, even if it is a simple point in shoot. It's a very intimate moment between what your capturing, the camera and most importantly - the person taking the shot.\n\nI know I'm no where being any good. I just enjoy doing this hobby. I really got to meet some cool people in the photography world. I feel proud as a teacher to have inspired one of my students to really get himself to do more photography. He has amazing shots by one-thousands times.\n\nThere are so many moments I captures that I will forever cherish. Many moments I won't show the world but maybe some day I will. Who knows? Some things are better left not reaching light.\n\nBelow are just some of my photos.

I've been eating out a bit more than I would like. I hate to say but I've been busy building new things on the web, work projects, and life overall. I'm taking a well deserved holiday soon to a place special to me in Mexico. I've been thinking how I need to cleanse and detach myself from the US food culture. I want to stay away as far from chemicals and additives. Don't get me wrong these are found in all countries, especially in processed foods.\n\nI'm excited to get some homemade food in Mexico. I'm excited for fresh ingredients from the farms and gardens in the village I am staying in. I feel that it's hard to know where your food is coming from when in the United States.\n\nThe goal is not to eat at any US-based chain fast food places or hamburgers, pizza - you know the common fast food culprits? This should be relatively easy because those are far away from the village I am staying in. Fast food has infiltrated even the most remote places. I want to indulge in so many authentic foods I don't get the chance to eat except when I am in Mexico. This is a change to reconnect with my roots, reform past relationships and find parts of me that United States culture has suppressed. Food is a good way to reconnect with lost parts of me.

I've been very fortunate to be around computers since i was three with these interactions been in school.\n\nHaving access to computers was game changing for me and has helped me. I would say I signed up for MySpace when I was ten. I know I am such a rule breaker. When I discovered personal websites, my mind exploded . . . metaphorically.\n\nCuriosity didn't kill the cat\n\nI remember when my parents upgraded from dial-up to DSL. I remember the lady at the phone company explaining all the details of the features included in our internet plan. Something that struck me was the FTP storage space. I thought, \"Wait, I can create a my website and have it hosted for free?\" This was in 2003 when I started my first personal website. I remember using basic HTML and clip art. I cringe just thinking about it. This was the stepping stone for me building and hosting websites. Using FTP was pretty advanced for an eight year old. I would stay up late just tinkering my site to make it perfect with poor HTML skills. It worked somehow?\n\nExpressing Myself\n\nI've always wanted to find ways to express myself. Since I was big into computers and tech, I figured I would use the website I built to share the things I enjoyed. I wanted to share who I was as a person. I had an idea who I was but I was still developing.\n\nInspired by others.\n\nI would look at other people who would blog and that would make me super gitty. I remember stumbling upon Matt Mullenweb back in 2003 and being inspired by him. He and many others taught me a lot about blogging. Learning by (browsing the internet) doing.\n\nBeing Resourceful.\n\nI would create new websites over the years. I couldn't afford to a pay for a website domain because I was eight years old and I wasn't going to ask my parents to spend money on something when I was more than grateful to have a computer and fast internet. I would use any free service I could until I could pay for it on my own.\n\nServices I'd use\n\nI would use a site in 2010 called Altervista where I officially used Wordpress for the first time. I made a big leap from HTML to the most popular CMS (of course I had no idea at the time). I decided this was the moment I would start expanding from a basic site to start blogging even if the posts had a few sentences. I used:\n\nAltervista\n\nDynDNS\n\nWordpress.com\n\nFreewebhosting\n\nToday\n\nOften, I really feel like that 8 year old who was discovering how to build things on the web.", "label": "personal"}

The time flew by and I made my way back home.\n\nThe last few weeks I've been reading on facial recognition. This has been a topic I've had an interest for quite some time. Our phones, our computers, and any item that had humble beginnings such as a door bell all have some form of facial recognition built in or programmed. It's weird to think about how you can unlock your phone with your face.\n\nPrivacy has become an issue with all these conveniences. Everywhere you go, your face (you as a person) is being tracked. EVERYWHERE!.\n\nSince I was traveling, I have been reading on facial recognition and the TSA\n\nAs a U.S. Citizen, I can opt out of facial recognition from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) :\n\nHere is a sign:\n\nA sign allowing U.S. citizens to opt out of facial scans.\n\nThe Experience\n\nI decided before I arrived at Los Angeles International AIrport (LAX) I decided to once I got to customs I would ask them to do a manual document check. I was already expecting them to ask me a bunch of questions. Things would either be easy or hard. I didn't want them running my face across different databases. Why should I give them more of my biometrics when they have this already?\n\nWhen I arrived at the he Customs and Border Protection Agent booth/station, I told them that I didn't want to my photo taken for facial scan. The agent went off on me. It seemed that he was shaming me for exercising my right to not have my face scanned. There were signs all over saying to inform an agent if I don't want my face scanned. This is exactly what I requested.\n\nThe Agent asked me the following questions\n\n\"Why are you doing this?\"\n\n\"Why are you making this more complicated?\"\n\n\"Do you see how many people have gone through starting this conversation?\"\n\n\"Do you that we have your facial biometics because you have a passport and driver's license?\"\n\n\"Any identity document you have is a biometric?'\n\nIt seemed that I was inconveniencing them for doing their job and providing a manual document check as my right to not to have my face scanned and verified across databases. The thing that made me mad was the intimidation tactics it seemed the agent was trying to get across. I didn't really appreciate that at all.\n\nMany of the questions the agent asked also came from the CBP Declaration Form 6059B.\n\nI was also asked where in Mexico I went, what other times I left the United States. I'm a person who provided to the point answers when asked. It's generally a good idea to provide answers not too short or answers too long either. They are law enforcement, you don't want to give unnecessary information to them either.\n\nI stood my ground. Eventually this whole ordeal was over and I moved on to collect my luggage.\n\nThe Issues\n\nThe issue I have is not the government has my biometrics, the problem I have is the how and who handles my data. This concern frightens me more when third-party companies or private companies are contracted by the government to handle this data. When other entities get involved,\n\nHow much control does a citizen have?\n\nHow much does the government actually follow up what these companies are doing with our data?\n\nHow is this information secured from hackers and kept safe?\n\nI felt so violated when I had to verify my identity for ID.me to access my IRS (Internal Revenue Service) to access my tax transcript. Why should a third party service be put in the way of accessing my government tax transcript? Why is identity verification being outsourced to a private company? The service wasn't really great at all. . It's so flawed for people of color.\n\nWe're in a Police Lineup", "label": "personal"}

One food item that always comes back with me is tlayudas.\n\nThis is a Tlayuda\n\nA tlayuda is a big tortilla tortilla that is a staple food in Oaxaca made out of corn and water. They are huge and twice the size of my head. These are no regular tortillas. This has been a food I've been eating since I was a young kid with my parents, grandparents, other relatives, and many friends. Even in moments of low funds, I have always been able to rely on these to meet my needs.\n\nOften times the tlayuda itself is the plate which you eat on. What I mean by this that often times you don't use an actual plate on the table to hold your tlayuda but the tlayuda is your plate.\n\nHow It's Eaten?\n\nThere are many ways on how you eat one but here are the ways I eat them:\n\nYou rip the tlayuda piece by piece until there is no more\n\nYou can roll it up and just starting biting into it.\n\nWhat's on this Tlayuda\n\nThis one is a simple Tlayuda. For the toppings, I used:\n\nTlayuda as the base\n\nHomemade refried beans\n\nQuesillo (Oaxacan String Cheese)\n\nChapulines (Grasshoppers). Yes, you read that correctly.\n\nWhy I Chose These Ingredients\n\nI brought back plenty of these ingredients with me from Oaxaca since I don't get to have these often or it's hard to find around here. Even when i do find them here, it doesn't have the same taste or the ingredients are old. I'm trying to eat as much of them as fast as I can.\n\nI love quesillo. Even though my body I don't agree with dairy much but quesillo is something that I never have a problem with. It probably the way it's cultured.\n\nI also haven't had much of an appetite the last few days and I haven't been craving much meat either. The chapulines provide me a substantial amount of protein and nutrients. It's common in Oaxaca to go multiple meals without eating meat. There are times where I don't eat meat for weeks at a time\n\nKeep Connected with My Roots\n\nAs a first generation Mexican-American and Oaxacan, food is important to me to help me stay connected with my culture.", "label": "personal"}

I see the cactus, the native grasses, the carrizo (giant reed) and any plant offspring that falls on the ground.\n\nThere are so many fields of crops as well. Nature and agriculture co-existing. It's weird how well they blend in with each other.\n\nMy favorite time to enjoy the garden is sun down. All the colors are breath taking to watch and see how day becomes night.

I got a great public education. It taught me how to say, \"Ope!\" and how to be a Midwestern Mexican Guy.\n\nIt's been in my mind for a while to leave. That, \"for a while\" thought has been in my mind since I was a kid. At a young age I had all these dreams and ambitions to live in various places throughout the world.\n\nI was very fortune to have visited different places in high school and in university, I got to live in France through study abroad. These experiences solidified my need to venture off more throughout the United States. Traveling abroad since I was a young kid has helped me realize there are so many great things outside of Nebraska. It's funny because I joke around how I've traveled more outside the country than in the country I reside in. I am very fortunate to have lived in Mexico for extended periods of time throughout my life.\n\nPreventing Resentment and Repeating the Mistakes of Others\n\nI've always craved so much more than the simple life back home. I didn't want to feel trapped and become resentful for lack of trying to live in and experiencing new things in new places. I see many of the people who I grew up with and reflect on my own self. I didn't want that lifestyle. So many people who I had wished had left Nebraska for greener pastures didn't leave. I didn't want to be trapped.\n\nQuestioning the Environment\n\nI've always questioned my environment. These are the questions:\n\nWhy don't we have public transportation?\n\nWhy is it weird to walk on the sidewalk in such a walk-able town?\n\nWhy are people of afraid of good change?\n\nWhy don't we think of the needs of young people who will lead the future?\n\nMy Lifestyle\n\nBeing Nebraska wasn't fitting my lifestyle anymore. I had outgrown the town of 25,000 habitants. Growing up, I never really accepted myself as a person in various degrees. I tolerated myself at best. I was smiling without actually being happy. This fa√ßade of being known as, \"the guy who always has a smile on his face,\" was getting old. It was draining me for years. I truly wasn't happy. No one would ever guess that. I lost myself as an individual and I also lost who I wanted to become as individual. Looking at myself in the mirror was not a true reflection of me. I just didn't feel like anything was truly going for me. There are so many things I wish I would have addressed sooner.\n\nLeaving Nebraska was going to happen sooner than later. I had a friend nudge me a few years back to finally do it. I am grateful he nudged me enough that I felt it in my ribs.\n\nCalifornia\n\nI'm Happier as a Person\n\nI'm living in California now for two years now. Time flies!\n\nI'm a lot happier here. I'm my more genuine self. I'm still not where I want to be. This is something that I am working on. California is not a perfect place.\n\nI've made a lot more progress here. I'm slowly healing myself. This will take time.", "label": "personal"}

Do you think about how as a person, it's hard to think about times you are truly by yourself? This has been something that has been on my mind a lot.\n\nToday, I went on a run today and drank a matcha latte at a coffee shop. It was nice just being in my thoughts and I appreciated being with myself and only myself. My mind was saying (or saying to itself?) \"This is relaxing!\"\n\nThis initiated me to start refecting on the activites I've done this year so far. I went through my phone's photo's apps, looked at my check-ins and any other history I had available. hen I started filtering out all things I've done alone and not with people. This is what I was able to recall the things I did or initiated by myself.\n\nSitting in a Coffee\n\nGoing to Noisebridge (San Francisco)\n\nGoing swimming in the river\n\nSeeing two films\n\nA few day trips?\n\nI ask myself the following questions: \"Am I not having a enough solo time?\" or \"Am I having a healthy amount of solo time?\"\n\nOften times, activites outside of home involve people in my day to day. I am not complaining about having a social circle. I just wondering for myself, \"What is a good balance?\", between activities that social and alone?\n\nAm I afraid to venture out on my own? Probably? Being at home is comfortable and I feel safe. Does my lack of knowing what is happening in my community add to this? More than likely. Does becoming a home body also play a roll. Yes!\n\nI should address these to make progress.\n\nFor those on the web, what is your take on this? Send me a webmention or email?", "label": "personal"}
{"title": "1000 Albums in 1000 Days", "url": "https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/one-thousand-albums-in-one-thousand-days", "content": "Sunday Morning Adventure\n\nIt was a Sunday and I was simply looking for something to do on an afternoon. Yesterday, I went to the bookstore yesterday in a long time. Going to the bookstore is a fun place to simply browse with no goal. You can simply just look and hope that something catches your eye. Oh boy! did a few things catch my eye! One book I really want to talk about is 1000 Record Covers by Michael Ors. Just as the title describes, it is a book showing different record covers. The book organized by decade (50s, 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s). It's a simple book with an record covers and a information about the record album. I inititally hesitated in purchasing this book. Then, I started thinking about my taste in music.\n\nBreaking The Loop\n\nI've been stuck in this loop of music where I listen to the same stuff over and over and over again. It's been something I've been disatisfied with myself for a while. I purchased this book not just look at all the vintage record covers, I want to expand my taste in music. So I decided to challenge myself to break away from comfortability by listening to music I don't listen to normally or never thought to listen.\n\nI am using this book as a guide to find new music. Streaming services ideally make it easy to discover new music. At the same time it seems overwhelming and distracting to even know what to discover. A book helps provide content without other distractions popping out of every direction. I also want to learn more music history throught listening which will spark my curiosity even more. I want to be able to find more ways to connect myself and see the world differently through music.\n\nThe First Album\n\nToday is Day One and we're starting at the 50's . I am listening to album Let's Go Dancing To Rock And Roll by Hen Gates And His Gaters\n\nTitle Let's Go Dancing to Rock and Roll Artist Hen Gates And His Gaters\n\nSo far, i've enjoyed it. It like the genre so far. We're off to a great start.\n\nSome limitations\n\nNot everything will be on Apple Music as I found out with Let's Go Dancing to Rock and Roll. Youtube is my next solution. That involves me making a playlist since it hasn't been organized by someone else. I won't let this discourage me but it will be challenging at times.\n\nHow long will this take?\n\nI will share my progress in listening and what I have learned so far in future blog posts, at various cyles such as various intervals. Definetly will share at albums number 250, 500, 750 and of course at 1000. According to basic math, it will take me close to 2.75 years to complete this if I do one album a day. This could either go faster or slower depending the circumstances.\n\nBuild a microsite\n\nI will create a web app or a static page that I update daily or every few days on what I am listening to from the book. It will take suggestions using webmentions and other forms of contact.\n\nThe link will come soon in an upate post.\n\nRecomendations\n\nDo any of you have any recommendations for music to listen to? Send them my way, I'd love to see what you all recommend!", "label": "personal"}

What I mean by irritable weather was facing, \"four seasons in one week.\" You're probably thinking the following: \"How is this possible?\" It simply does! If you know, you know. Here are a few examples (No particular order)\n\nOne day it can be a nice spring day with all the flowers blooming being happy as can be. The following day you could wake up to find out that there is a blizzard in effect. A few days, it could be scorching hot and wondering how we got here? The last few days of the week, it could be a beautiful, soothing fall day and you forget about the weather tragedies of earlier of the week.\n\nAs chaotic as it sounds, I do miss it. I do miss sometimes not knowing if I will melt one day or be trapped in my home for many days at a time. My favorite is knowing if my home would fly away in a tornado. As silly and boring the topic of weather is, it is also a bonding activity with people who live in this region. It's almost a pastime knowing we could just die at any minute.\n\nIf I were to pick a favorite season, it would be winter. Are you in shock? Even I don't believe it. I do miss dressing up all nice for the winter. Who doesn't like wearing cute winter outfits. If were going to suffer in the cold we might as well look our best!\n\nI moved to California to live in a different place and subconsciously to escape the cold. In Northern California it is generally just hot here all the time. I do miss having season changes. Geography and location tends to influence the type of weather or climate one lives in.\n\nYou can take the person out of the midwest but you can't take the Midwestern out of the person.\n\nAlso posted on IndieNews", "label": "personal"}

This is angering and saddening. This creates a huge hole on the UNK campus. I graduated from the university in 2019. I graduated with a B.A. in Modern Languages. This hurts to hear that many programs such as the French program are being cut. The Modern Language Department was my home during my time at the University. It pushed me out of my comfort zone that led me to even great worldview experiences such as study abroad. The French program in Modern Languages helped prepare me to become a teacher and helped to interact with people of all backgrounds and cultures.\n\nUNK needs to have a complete modern language department to prepare students in this globalized world. Learning a language isn't about learning simply a language. Languages expand a person's worldview. You learn culture, you learn experiences, you learn how different societies work. We can't have young people's viewpoints and perspectives stuck glued to the environment they are in. They need to branch out. Going to college is a place where people learn to build deeper connections with others. This includes people they interact with daily and people who are different from them culturally. The modern languages department is such a vital program.\n\nWhat hurts more is the attack on the arts and humanities. The arts and humanities are important for a well rounded education. We need students to explore subjects outside of their majors. I learned a lot from the humanities and the arts.\n\nI ask the University of Nebraska not to eliminate these programs. If the entire university system wants to retain more people in Nebraska, before entering, during college, and post college, we must allow these opportunities.\n\nUNK is the only proper public university in Nebraska that geographically serves so many students in the western half of the state. UNK offers so many programs closer to home that many in years past had to attend schools further away from home to enter the programs needed.\n\nI am proud to be a graduate of the University of Nebraska at Kearney. This saddens me to see UNK and the entire university system go through this dark time. Please reconsider all the damage that is to come. Every single higher position university administrator and faculty must fight for the interest of students - current and present.\n\nRepresentatives of the Nebraska University system need to find and pressure funding from the state. The state has done so much damage from cutting budgets year after year. We must fight those who are against public education and higher education who put us in a chokehold.\n\nWe are currently facing so many attacks on public education and higher education from various places.

{"title": "Round-Up of October 2023 IndieWeb Carnival", "url": "https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/indieweb-carnival-selfcare-round-up", "content": "October is a wrap! üéÉ I hosted October's IndieWeb Carnival on self-care. Thank you to everyone who participated in this month's IndieWeb Carnival topic. I appreciate all the responses I recieved. I recieved so many perspectives on the topic. I chose this theme as this is something I am working on improving for myself.\n\nCarnival Stats Responses 10 Happiness ‚àû\n\nResponses\n\nSara Jak≈°a - Using 4 E of Cognition to Conceptualise Self-Care\n\nI really enjoyed the way way you structured your reponse using the 4 E of cognition: embodied, embedded, extended, and enactivistic. I really appreciate the approaches using your educational background to explain. It has really helped me see things in a different perspective. I agree that self-care is \"a process to adapt my life\". One must adapt. You're right, I can't ignore self-care because whether or not I felt I was ignoring it. I was doing it whether I admit it or not. I now see it as having a low battery. It had some juice. I realize now I was also scared of myself, nervous of outcomes, and more. I realized many things. I ignored my ehealth. I really enjoy how you ended the response, \"do the self-care for the reason of your better wellbeing.\" I am doing this for myself.Thank you for being so straight foward and not beating around the bush.\n\nGrigor Malo - Should we care about self-care?\n\nI really enjoyed \"[your] answer to the prompt\" and the approach. I would agree with you some self-care/help guides do take the wrong approach. It often seems like how to appear to be fine on the outside but not actually on the inside. It's been hard in the pastto find self-care/help material related to my cultural background or for individuals who live in a multiculural life. There is no one size fits all. Hyper-individualism or individualism has been a conflicting thing for me. Why do we need to isolate ourself when things can also be experienced with other people as well. I also agree that action at the end of the day starts with the individual. \"Caring about your self is a fundamentally selfish endeavour? Not really, or at least not if practiced properly.\" That is a beautifully written phrase. I share many of the same thoughts on wellness industry and the corporate wellness. You really put in the persepective how much we buy into capitalism to feel better about ourselves.\n\nFrank Meeuwsen - Global PSC Awareness Day and selfcare\n\nFirst, I like the multilingual approach created for this post. Thank you for sharing about Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis and your experience living with this disease. I really enjoy the approach you take. With self-care you learn to see things in a positive light. I agree with \"to rest more and consciously slow down.\" This has been something I've been learning as well. It became unhealth and bad for mental health. Strecthing yourself thin is not feasible anymore. I appreciate you aspect on learning to take control of a situation. \"I know I can affect it. I know now that I can change it.\" This resonates with me so much!\n\nJeremy Cherfasi - Self-care Success\n\nI really your approach of enjoying the little and big things in life. I can agree that traveling has always been a way of self-care. A way to disconnect physically from the place one is based out of to a different environment. Self-care to you seems that you truly enjoy life and you genuinely enjoy the things you do such as biking, baking, etc. You wrote having \"a sense of purpose and of mastery\" is something I resonate with. I'm still trying to find my sense of purpose. I'm learning not to stretch myself thin an focus on the things I love. I love who you wish the drivers to take care of themselves\n\nTracy Durnell - Extending my understanding of self-care\n\nRight off the bat, your approach on the \"bigger whole\" is a like a piece of the puzzle or a train network. If any of it is missing, it simply doesn't work well. Community is so important. Unforntunately we live in a very individualistic society and we need community more than ever. \"So much of self-care is treating the symptoms rather than the source, because the source is systemic.\" I didn't think about it this way. I recently started going to therapy and I thought the goal was to get to the get to the root of the problem while hitting the symptoms like a ping pong. Thank you for sharing the books you mentioned in your response. There are so many self-care books it's hard to find where to start. I'm trying to get to the right path. Oh man, this is hits hard: \"Showing up for our friends better, sometimes that means showing up for ourselves, and sometimes it‚Äôs shared.\" This makes me reflect, when I wasn't for there for myself, I wasn't there for my community in this case, my friends. If I wasn't Self-care shows that you can care for yourself and for others. This has been a year of improvement but so much I still have to reach. Thank you for sharing this perspective on community and individuals. This opened my eyes in so many ways.\n\nAnthony Ciccarello - Creating space to feel my emotions\n\nI can relate so much with Anthony's response. Right away, the second sentence, \"My natural inclination is to bury my own emotions to protect my relationships\" is very similar to what I've felt over the years. All at my expense. Bottling it all up just wears a peson down. I've been very hesitant about sharing that I've been seeing a therapist and how I've started to open up a lot more to people on what's happening in life. I really appreciate your emphasis and approach on the word, space. A space can have so many purposes. I've been learning how to use spaces inside and outside as more than being inside and outside. The space one uses can truly affect the outcomes of self-care. Spaces to think, spaces, to move, spaces to unwind, and a space to grow demonstrate healthy, safe, self-reflection and so much more.\n\nJo - Things to do offline\n\nJo does a great job at \"kill[ing] two birds with one stone\" by addressing the self-care prompt and a post I wrote on books. The response is amazing. I really like perspective on reading books. I don't discourage reading not matter the format. We live in a world where we have so many different mediums of reading. Reading away from anything that has a microchip of any kind is for me a form of reset. Just like you mentioned, sometimes the only way to get access to specific content is via digital means. Reading physical really helps reground and reconnect with the digital world. Having solo time and hanging out with people is great but a balance is necessary. You defintely don't want to go to far on the solo end or not having solo time and spending too much time with others. It's a preference in many aspects. I enjoyed your self-care activity list! I get lost with looking at vinyls at the record shop.\n\nCJ - Self-Care and Routine\n\nCJ has some great points on find things at are less \"productive-feeling.\" For the longest time, doing things like watching Netflix or go to the movies, I felt that I was wasting time and I pushed these activities away. It's been hard just to disconnect from my obligations and I've come to the realizations that I need to sit my ass down and just relax. It's not necessary to be always engaged in things that are \"productive.\" It's productive to let your mind engage in other things!\n\nAlex Sirac - Improving our relationship to news\n\nAlex has a written a great post on self-care by focusing on news consumption. Right away you wrote, \"Not only do I spend too much time on the Internet ‚Äì I spend way too much time consuming content and news.\" You took the words right out of my mouth. News isn't limited to listening to reading it online, or watching it on the television (or historically radio). Now the news in the 21st comes in so many different mediums such as podcasts. I've seen an increase of this negative news. It discourages me to use any form of social media, even decentralized social media. I want to ignore but it seems hard not to even if you don't click links. \"Curating a me-friendly news experience\" by \"find[ing] the things that bring you joy and give your brain a break from the hate.\" It's important to step away from even if it's for a little while. We can't let it consume us to the core. It will make use dark and bitter. I catch myself becoming angry. You make a great point on finding the right sources and filtering things out by using an RSS reader. Even I as an avid New York Times and leftist news person, have to turn off my computer and throw my phone across the room to reattach myself to the world around me. It's got to the point where I have to go into my terminal and turn off the Docker container and turn of my RSS reader. There has to be a better way for everything. Support local journalism because we need to know what's happening in our hometowns and the places we live. We need to now what's happening in our communities to make a difference and become aware what's around us.\n\nJames G - Self Care\n\nJames wrote beautiful response regarding self-care. It is complicated! This has been something I've had to learn the hardway, \"I know, deep down, that feeling is unsustainable: one can't be creative every day.\" We want to create more every damn day. It's not always feasible. I agree with the following, \"I don't need to create new things all the time.\" The way I see it, is work on the things you are working on and give it your full attention in a reasonable manner. It's great to find comfort in things we are familiar with. It allows us to be vulnerable.\n\nLate or Missing Reponses\n\nIf you still would like to write a response for October, I'd be happy to recieve more. If you sent me a response and I missed it, please email me directly at pablo@lifeofpablo.com. I'll update this post.\n\nNovember IndieWeb Carnival\n\nNow, I will pass torche to Alex Sirac.

I remember watching television and videos on the internet of people getting on public transportation. I always wondered why it isn't common to have it everywhere. I've lived in various parts around the world where it is simply normal to have various methods of public transportation. Having lived in Mexico for short periods of times, I did ride buses to get to the city because it was the most economical way. One slight issue living in the United States, I didn't grow up in an area where public transportion was none existent. I grew up in Nebraska. You needed a car to get around. It was also weird to be walking around. I found that idea to be weird.\n\nThe world has been surpassing the United States for decades. It's getting more obvious every day.\n\nSince I moved the California, I've taken the Amtrak Train thirty-five (35) times since 2021. It's an easy trip to do between Sacramento and San Francisco or even to other cities in California.\n\nTimes I've Taken the Train Year Progress 2021 - 7 Times 2022 - 9 Times 2023 - 17 Times\n\nThe last time I did even remotely close to this was when I was living in France. I still have all the tickets to show.\n\nReasons I Take The Train:\n\nEnvironment - A lot more people can move around all at one time and it elimates so many cars off the roads. It helps reduce emissions.\n\nConvenience - There is enough trains throught out the day, that you can just book your ticket minutes before it heads out.\n\nAvoiding traffic - Driving isn't fun when you're surrounded by cars waiting for the line to move. It's nice not having to wait around in traffic when the train is simply going on its way on the the tracks.\n\nNot paying for parking - Parking in cities such as San Francisco is so expensive or you have to move your car for city services. It seems so much of a hastle to be worrying about your car in a place where you can walk.\n\nNot worrying about my car in a big city. - With so many car break-ins happening throughout cities in the United States, I can breath a sigh of relief knowing I don't have to worry about my car left alone or pondering if I did my best to get everything out of sight.\n\nI can get work done on the train. - I'm always working on my computer and I can get so much done weather it's for work or for personal endeavors.\n\nI also enjoy getting groceries at Trader Joe's before I get on the train especially if I'm going to get back to Sacramento late. It's nice to be able to get groceries for the week and take them with me on the train. It's a small little habit or tradition. I also save money by buying snacks ahead of time and not having to spend extra on snacks on the train.\n\nI hope my friend Sammy can come out to California for a fun train ride from Sacramento to San Francisco. I know he'd love it. Heck even one of these days, I'd love to catch the train that runs (Amtrak California Zephyr) through our hometowns in Nebraska and ride up to Sacramento. Hopefully soon!", "label": "personal"}

Merci Alex pour ta pr√©sentation sur la sujet de communaut√©.\n\nCommunity and belonging for me means, a place I feel that I belong and a place where I can be accepted for who I am. It's been hard to integrate into some communities. Often, being the only person color in a community has been difficult at times.We enter and leave communities as we older. Some communities change for the greater good and others change not for the greater good. I belong to different communities. My background and life experiences have influenced who I've become and the things I've been interested in. I've entered new ones while I've left others. Some communities I can come back and be able to jump right in right where I left off. There are communities where it was only during a certain period of my life and might be harder to be in now. There are communities where I've had to leave because it no longer followed who I was as a person or it wasn't good for me. Some became dangerous in their vission\n\nI'd like to talk about community and belonging in these three (3) situations or places.\n\nBeing a Multilingual\n\nBeing a Student in France\n\nIndieWeb\n\nI'd like to write about these topics in this carnival but I'd like to take make a dedicated post with a slightly different approach.\n\nBeing Mexican and American\n\nGrowing up in Nebraska\n\nBeing Multilingual\n\nHere in the United States, it's not common for people to speak another language. Which is a shame. Growing up in a small town in Nebraska, it often seemed that it was few of us who would consistently speak another language. Even at a young age, I felt we had a small unintentional community. I was very fortunate to grow up bilingual - Spanish & English (in this order). Then I learned French in my teens.\n\nBeing a multilingual here in the United States has allowed me to be join new communities. With the amount of people who don't speak at least a second language on a constant basis, it almost feels exclusive to be multilingual. It allows me to have deeper connections with others. It allows me to belong in various communities. When I was living in Omaha, One example is attending French speaking events at Alliance Fran√ßaise and on Meet-Up. It was so amazing that I could find so many individuals who I can speak French with and share many of the world views. It was nice to meet so many francophiles and francophones who enjoyed sharing culture, language, cuisine, wine and so much more. I would become great friends with these individuals. Now that I live far away, I know if I were to visit or move back, I could rejoin this community. Going back to a place where I'm a visitor and one I am familiar with, I know I can find a place of belonging again.\n\nGrowing up in a place that lacked lingual diversity, or to simply put it - growing up in a very vanilla place, it also seemed that there was a community that didn't seem to like people speaking different languages. It seemed to alienate them. There seemed to be pressure to join the community where one needed to behave and present themselves with the majority. I know people who had my cultural background give into that community and not speak their language spoken at home. Parents gave in the idea that there kids will be more valuable in society if they don't speak another language. I felt supported and limited by these co-existing communities. I'd be lying if at one point I didn't fall in this negative community. I felt at times I needed this negative community to to belong. Learning to belong to something that conflict with my values felt like being pulled in both directions.\n\nBeing a Student in France\n\nI have very fond memories of being an exchange student in France. I studied at the Universit√© de Strasbourg at the age 22. Being a student in France was different compared the attending university in the United States. Being in University you build Not only was I apart of the exchange student community but I was also a student trying to improve my French abilities. I was the only student from the university back home who attended a program in France. I isolated myself the Americans. In a way I left the \"American\" community for many months. I saw this as a blessing to form new habits and quickly find a new community or communities. We were here to learn the French language. We all were from various parts of the world. I was hanging out with all the people and students from France, the rest of the European Union, South America, and basically anyone from around the world. Just not the Americans\n\nWe were homesick. We bonded with food. We made meals from our respective cultures. We would learn about their upbringing and how they got to France. We all bonded together because many of us had experiences with immigrant culture. Many of these students were also immigrants to France or have been in the European Union already. They were trying establish themselves and incorporate themselves in the society. Seeing them everyday reminded me of my parents telling me stories of them trying to make their way in the United States. I understand being in a new place and trying to find a sense of belonging can be daunting.\n\nYes, I could do many of these things back at my home university. There was such a deeper connection with these international students. We were living and studying in a place where being a student meant so much more. I felt I could have genuine conversations with people. I really felt like I belonged here and understand what it's like to be student outside the United States. Student community here is nothing like in the United States.\n\nIndieWeb\n\nOh the IndieWeb! I joined back in March 2023. I heard of the IndieWeb throughout the years but didn't think much of it. I'm happy that I got the interest and courage to join. This is a community that I am truly happy to have found. It has become a community I truly feel that I am apart of. The best part of it is getting to meet so many great people and interacting with them on a weekly basis. People are so willing to help each other out. I've had people reach out if there is something wrong with my website or microformats are not placed correctly. It's been pretty rad attending Homebrew Website Club. Every single one of them has been pretty amazing. I really enjoy the encouragement of taking initiative to as planning events, starting writing carnivals, etc. It's a pretty open group.\n\nThe IndieWeb has helped me grow as an individual. It has also rekindled the fire in things I didn't think I would find interest again. One example of that is blogging. It This community has helped me find a new place of belonging.\n\nI will admit since I'm still relatively new to the community, I'm still a little shy and still learning the ropes. I know that this is part of the journey.\n\nConclusion\n\nI'm happy with all these experiences.", "label": "personal"}

I'm that person who doesn't use Spotify. I left Spotify a while ago. I instead use Apple Music does something similar to Spotify Wrapped. I honestly didn't know that Apple Music had a feature to share. Now it's time for the results my Apple Music Replay'23 (the Apple equivalent to Spotify Wrappted) to shine. It was interesting because I had to launch my browser to get the Replay'23 instead of it being in app. It was easy to share on social media as images. My listens ranged from mid/late 2000s to more recent. I really liked listening to The Submarines. I'm a sucker for the song Brightest Hour.\n\nThis coming I would like to discover smaller indie bands and attend more concerts to get out of my cycle of repeating and getting too comfortable with the things I listen often.\n\nI really like Jo's Post on what she listened to on Spotify. I love what you listened to this year and how you organized your post!\n\nI read Henrique's Post on what he listened to on Spotify. He made me remember that I need to give my vinyls a little more love (or a spin) and decrease my listening minutes on my phone.\n\nI know I have an interesting taste in Music but I like listening to alternative.\n\nWell here you go!

He also asks his readers to answer the question\n\nWhere do you call home? And why? I‚Äôve been struggling with the concept of home for the past several years.\n\nOn the surface, this seems like a very simple question to answer but the answer can be be complex. For me, I take the complex route. I too have been struggling with this question. Home is where major moments have occured in my life.\n\nI grew up in Nebraska which was home for 25+ years. I say this is one place I call home is due to the fact this is where I grew up. It's where I learned the norms of the Midwest and how it influenced my persona. Nebraska is home because this is where many of my friends I made in university still reside. I have many deep connections with others. I somehow always end up here such as the holidays and other important events. It's a very special place to me but it is not the place I cull my current home.\n\nMexico is also my home for the fact I've lived there on an off though out the years. I learned what is was like to be around non-Americans. Living in Mexico, I got meet so many family members. I learned more of the traditions of my people and how live in a community. I learned that this was a place of rich culture and rich gastronomy. I learned to not take things for granted. It's a place I call home because it allows me to be different person compared to my American self. For the record, I don't go to resorts, I stay in rural Mexico. This is a home I return to often. This home is important to my identity.\n\nThe home I consider currently now is in California. This is the first place I moved away to where I didn't go back to my parents' home after an extended leave such as a trip or going to university. I work here now and I have built out new relationships. I'm still pretty new here. Living in California has allowed me to be more of myself and allow me to express myself. This is home because I get to work on myself as well. When people ask me where am I based out of or where is my home is, I always say California.\n\nI also ask the same question, \"Where do you call home? And why?\"", "label": "personal"}

When I'm on the plane ride home, various memories run through my head as I am excited to visit home. I think about the things I need to get done while I am home. I'm excited to see my friends and most importantly, my family.\n\nMy hometown is quiet. There's enough to do. There are stores, parks, movie theaters. Just enough. There are subtle things I do miss about my hometown. It's the place that saw me grow up. A place where I am familiar with.\n\nSomething happens as I enter my childhood home. I spent most of my childhood in this house. When I step into the home, so many many memories flood my mind. It's like I unzipped a .zip file and the entire folder just spills. Every step I take and every time I turn my head, flashbacks come to me as well.\n\nThere are so many moments that make me feel happy. I remember it was here I got my first computer. It's where I learned to ride a bike. I remember helping my mom study for the U.S Citizenship Test everyday afterschool. I remember numerous times packing and unpacking for/from Mexico. I remember the moment I learned I was accepted into university.\n\nMy bedroom was a place of safety. A place where I could be myself. The place where I learned. I took apart my first computer. A place I recorded my first audio note. A place to allow my emotions to run free.\n\nWe didn't live in the best house but it was our house. We had a roof over our heads.\n\nI reflect back on all this and it brings a smile of joy. So much has happened. So many things happening in the background I didn't know were happening.\n\nI'm here now rearranging my room. I feel happy that I can still make it my own and still have a place of safety.", "label": "personal"}
{"title": "The Friend I Made on the Bus", "url": "https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/friend-on-bus", "content": "I was browsing the web and I happened to stumble upon this Instagram post. It was a screenshot of a tweet OP posted about two girls on a cruise who became best friends for the day. One of the girls was looking for her best friend that day.\n\nHere is what the post said, if you don't want to open an Instagram link. The post also has the picture of two girls on the cruise sitting next to each other.\n\nin Hawaii in 2006. We were basically best friends for that night so I need y'all to help me find my bestfriend because I miss her and I need to see how she's doing now. Please retweet this so we can be reunited.\n\nThis helped me unlock a memory of an experience I had as a young kid. I remember my family and I took the Greyhound bus back from Mexico all the way to Nebraska. This was in the early 2000s. Let me tell you. When you're six or seven on a bus from Southern Mexico to Nebraska, you feel like dying, died, and forgot you died on a 48+ hour (or however long) ride. Maybe I'm being dramatic. It wasn't a pleasant ride, at least most of it.\n\nI remember when the bus made a stop somewhere in Texas possibly in Austin or Dallas. I remember I was already having a bad time since I've been on a bus for an extended amount of time. Then some kid around my age got on the bus with his family. I gave him the nod to acknowledge him. He happened to sit near us. An hour or so had passed and I was curious and was desperate to talk to someone who wasn't in my family. So I said hello to the kid. I don't regret doing so.\n\nWhen I said hello, right off the bat we hit it off. We were talking about a bunch of nerd stuff that kids our age were interested in.. I remember bringing up our computers and we lost our minds. I was telling him about the iMac G3s I would use at school or how my friend built a small website on his computer. He would tell me about things he'd create on Kid Pix. We also talked about our favorite TV shows, our hobbies, and upbringings. We shared stories. This kid was super cool! I hope he thought I was cool too. We had a grand old time.\n\nAt some point, he and his family had to get off to their transfer point or it was their final destination. We said our goodbyes. Then I waved at him, he waved back when he was on the ground. It was a very warm and sad moment to say goodbye to my best friend of that day.\n\nI unfortunately don't remember his name and I doubt he remembers mine. At that time, it wasn't common for young kids to have a cell phone. We didn't exchange numbers or email. I think about this often. I wish I could find out where he is and if he is doing well. Who knows what paths we've taken? Have we crossed paths and not known it? I hope we get to meet someday and this post comes across him and we could reconnect.\n\nIf you're out there man, say hello!\n\nDo you have a story similar to this? I'd love to hear from you.", "label": "personal"}

When the holidays approach, I get excited to see snow on the ground. There are so many celebrations and traditions that exist. For myself, I celebrate Mexican traditions and American celebrations. I live between the two cultures and grew up in the United States and have lived in Mexico. At my parents home, we celebrate as if we were in Mexico.\n\nEvery year is different. Sometimes I'm in Oaxaca during the month of December and sometimes I'm in the United States. We celebrate Mexican traditions there but more precisely, the Oaxacan traditions. I like to go see the dances and the parades. May I say it's heavenly go to the food markets and try all the delicious meals.\n\nMexican Traditions:\n\nMy family really likes cooking at home. We make many traditional dishes. We make tamales of various flavors, Mexican punch, mole, cakes, shrimp cocktails, and so much more. There's no limit. In this month, we don't normally eat out. Homemade food tastes so much better!\n\nIn the evenings, we relax and watch some holiday movies. We like to watch movies in Spanish, especially any of the classics. Every year we see Home Alone in Spanish because it's very funny. It hits differently in Spanish. Just being together is important. We can laugh as a family.\n\nWe do decorate our Christmas tree. We open the presents on the night of December 24. It's a traditon. It's always been like that.\n\nUnited States Traditions:\n\nI always make sure to meet up with my friends when I return to Nebraska. Now that we don't live near each other anymore, it's very important to be together when we are back in our hometowns. We check in with each other and see how our year went and what our goals are for the upcoming year. We build ginger houses and we have a party. What could go wrong? Depending on how the weather is, we're riding our longboards or we're going to skate park.\n\nIm always excited for a night of programming fun. We just see where the night will take us. We make it our goal to stay up until dawn. It's a very nice thing to schedule something together. I think we're going to make a video game this year. Let's see what happens...\n\nThis is my response to IndieWeb Carnival December 2023 ‚Äî Holiday and December traditions Thank you for hosting Jo!

As I am learning to implement a Micropub Server on my site, I feel that I should learn how JSON works. In a way JSON has been used on my site before by using microformats in the rendered HTML code and being read by other sites and services. I've been wanting to explore ways to update content on my site in a more effective manner instead of having to manually update html code for each entry of a list. An example of this would be a list of movies I watched. This is still a a learning process. I have so much to learn. I want to expand Datenstrom Yellow, the flat-file c I am using, to still be simple but be powerful at the same time.\n\nAn issue I have to work out for longevity and simplicity is by creating an extension for the different lists. Right now I have to create a layout for a particular list such as movies , create a new markdown page in my content folder, and finally set the desired layout (template). An example of this would be Layout: movies . This isn't ideal when I write a blog post. If I changed the layout of a blog post, it wouldn't be recognized as a blog post in the main blog feed. That's where an extension would come in place and place it in the markdown file of the blog post or any other page I'd like to create on my website. This wouldn't require to change the layout. In the markdown file, I could simply place, [list 1] or even simply, [movies] to show the list. Coming Soon!\n\nExample Code:\n\nHere's the layout for movies.html . I use PHP to create the reoccuring HTML elements automatically when I modify the movie JSON file. It will update the list accordingly.\n\n$this ->yellow->layout( \"header\" ) < div class = \"content\" > < div class = \"main h-entry\" role = \"main\" > < h1 > echo $this ->yellow->page->getHtml( \"titleContent\" ) </ h1 > < div class = \"entry-content e-content\" > echo $this ->yellow->page->getContentHtml() </ div > < div class = \"mw6 center\" > $catalog_json = file_get_contents( 'media/downloads/movies.json' ); $decoded_json = json_decode($catalog_json, true ); $items = $decoded_json[ 'movies' ]; foreach ($items as $item) { $id = $item[ 'id' ]; $name = $item[ 'title' ]; $cover = $item[ 'cover' ]; $info_url = $item[ 'info_url' ]; echo '<article class=\"h-item\">' ; echo '<a class=\"link dt w-100 bb b--black-10 pb2 mt2 dim blue u-url\" href=\"' .$info_url. '\">' ; echo '<div class=\"dtc w4\">' ; echo '<img src=\" ' .$cover. '\" class=\"db w-100 u-photo\" alt=\"movie poster of ' .$name. '\"/>' ; echo '</div>' ; echo '<div class=\"dtc v-top pl2\">' ; echo '<h1 class=\"f6 f5-ns fw6 lh-title black mv0 p-name\">' .$name. '</h1>' ; echo '<dl class=\"mt2 f6\">' ; echo '<dt class=\"clip\">ID</dt>' ; echo '<dd class=\"ml0\">ID: ' .$id. '</dd>' ; echo '</dl>' ; echo '</div>' ; echo '</a>' ; echo '</article>' ; } </ div > < div class = \"permalink\" > Permalink: < a class = \"u-url\" href = \"https://lifeofpablo.com<?php echo $this->yellow->page->getLocation($absoluteLocation = false) ?>\" > https://lifeofpablo.com echo $this ->yellow->page->getLocation($absoluteLocation = false ) </ a > </ div > </ div > </ div > $this ->yellow->layout( \"footer\" )\n\nJSON\n\nThis is the example movie JSON (movies.json) code for the movies I watched in 2023. As I CRUD (create, read, update, delete) entries, the PHP code will parse the code with the latest version of the JSON file.\n\n{ \"movies\" : [ { \"id\" : 0 , \"title\" : \"Barbie\" , \"cover\" : \"https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTps15LVPBd4bN4dWOYwJ1ggcNE_4tzLnR10qZlngWbwQ4G-cgE\" , \"info_url\" : \"https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/346698-barbie?language=en-US\" }, { \"id\" : 1 , \"title\" : \"The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes\" , \"cover\" : \"https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRvwP_lNaUz46LtcewMX0xdKd4bT-8hAHaAt8HjB96tLsMolVVT\" , \"info_url\" : \"https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/695721-the-hunger-games-the-ballad-of-songbirds-snakes?language=en-US\" }, { \"id\" : 2 , \"title\" : \"Shrek 2\" , \"cover\" : \"https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSFADKf7LWrP_r2PkPMo4zVxAdgoUK4KMtgRsfMSUTpisbpGG7N\" , \"info_url\" : \"https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/809-shrek-2?language=en-US\" }, { \"id\" : 3 , \"title\" : \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" , \"cover\" : \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/88/Killers_of_the_Flower_Moon_film_poster.jpg\" , \"info_url\" : \"https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/466420-killers-of-the-flower-moon?language=en-US\" }, { \"id\" : 4 , \"title\" : \"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness\" , \"cover\" : \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/17/Doctor_Strange_in_the_Multiverse_of_Madness_poster.jpg\" , \"info_url\" : \"https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/453395-doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness?language=en-US\" }, { \"id\" : 5 , \"title\" : \"The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent\" , \"cover\" : \"https://www.themoviedb.org/t/p/w1280/8JzPuj4lNQv0wmd38u0ee1dxzhn.jpg\" , \"info_url\" : \"https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/648579-the-unbearable-weight-of-massive-talent?language=en-US\" }, { \"id\" : 6 , \"title\" : \"Sonic the Hedgehog 2\" , \"cover\" : \"https://www.themoviedb.org/t/p/w1280/6DrHO1jr3qVrViUO6s6kFiAGM7.jpg\" , \"info_url\" : \"https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/675353-sonic-the-hedgehog-2?language=en-US\" }, { \"id\" : 7 , \"title\" : \"It's Still Your Bed\" , \"cover\" : \"https://www.themoviedb.org/t/p/w1280/wtHBxOisTtU10ieNoXHX62kB613.jpg\" , \"info_url\" : \"https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/613027-it-s-still-your-bed?language=en-US\" }, { \"id\" : 8 , \"title\" : \"Dog\" , \"cover\" : \"https://www.themoviedb.org/t/p/w1280/rkpLvPDe0ZE62buUS32exdNr7zD.jpg\" , \"info_url\" : \"https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/626735-dog?language=en-US\" }, { \"id\" : 9 , \"title\" : \"Uncharted\" , \"cover\" : \"https://www.themoviedb.org/t/p/w1280/rJHC1RUORuUhtfNb4Npclx0xnOf.jpg\" , \"info_url\" : \"https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/335787-uncharted?language=en-US\" } ]}\n\nThis JSON file with the help of PHP to render HTML content:", "label": "personal"}

I started to consume matcha two years ago. Ever since, I've been hooked on it. I love getting matcha from different places from coffee shops or restaurants because when mixed in for a drink, each place makes it different. Most of the time, I consume matcha as a tea or as a latte. There is something so special about getting in a different city. When I was visiting New York City, I lived on matcha lattes and matcha teas to keep me going on the miles and miles of walking that I'm not used to doing. Being a city like New York, it is exhausting mentally and physically due to the stimuli and increased physical activity from the sedentary lifestyle.\n\nMatcha has caffeine in it but it doesn't affect me the same as coffee. Coffee and espresso keeps me jittery and has be bouncing off the walls. Not a good feeling overall. I'm not opposed to having coffee or espresso but not my preferred choice. Matcha doesn't keep me up at night. I don't see it as coffee but an item that has caffeine.\n\nWhen I went back to Nebraska, I was happy that some of the non-Starbucks coffee shops had matcha. I guess matcha is more common than ever.\n\nAm I crazy about matcha? Probably? Who am I kidding?! YES! I don't drink it often but when I do, I'm as happy as can be (at the moment.) It's the little things in life. I probably should make my own at home because it adds up going out to get it. That's a decision for another day.\n\nJust realized this could be a love letter to matcha. Maybe it isn't.\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è\n\nFavorite Places to get matcha (no particular order):", "label": "personal"}

I am very happy. I learned so much from this course and revisited topics I knew already. I definitely picked up some new skills for my current role. The certificate had five courses ranging from basic networking to IT Security. I would say this was a well rounded course. It really put in perspective various aspects of an IT Support Professional. It was also a wake-up call! I have so much to learn still!!!\n\nBeing in this role, you could be a generalist or a specialist. This depends on the role one gets. In my role and working with a small team of IT professionals, I find myself being a generalist but also specialized in specific things.\n\nI find it important is to keep learning in my career. I plan on taking more courses to get more certificates to gain more skills. I started a Google Cyber Security Course and a mathematics course. I'm going to try to balance three to five courses. I want to get in the routine of going back to school. I find this funny because I work at a school. By having this routine, I would like to start my Master's program this year.\n\nI'm really excited for what's to come this year!

I noticed prices over the last year have been going up everywhere and Trader Joe's is no exception. I've been working on only buying the things I only need or things to supplement the items I have at home. For example, I bought spinach dip to help me finish the chips I have at home and I bought baby carrots (Cut & Peeled Carrots) to help finish the spinach dip. Inflation is coming on all of us hard. I almost gasped out loud in the store when I saw the price of a litter bottle of the Extra Virgin Olive Oil. I remember it being $8.99 now it's $10.99. It's just the little things that add up. I have to be extra mindful of the inventory of my kitchen and buy only the things I need and think of items that be versatile in use.\n\nOne of my goals this year is to simply not be as wasteful.

{"title": "Another side of me", "url": "https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/another-side-of-me", "content": "Another side of me\n\nBisexual Flag\n\nThis post was written in English (en_US).\n\nBackground\n\nBlogging has been such a great outlet for me this past year. In the past I would blog sporadically. I've always loved blogging as it allows me to express myself and allow my thoughts to flow (when they feel like it). It's allowed me to become more expressive and to reconnect with myself. I would say I feel more satisfied in becoming more expressive and to reconnect myself. It's a piece of a puzzle.\n\nDeciding What to Share\n\nYou know how there are things about yourself for the longest time, you didn't know whether or not to share publicly? There are things I'm not willing to share. At some point you are ready to share certain things. Then, you come to the realization of \"How am I going to put this in words?\" That's the part that's tricky. That's me at this very moment in time. I'm ready to share. I'll do my best.\n\nThe Journey\n\nPart of this journey has been working on myself and learning to accept who I am as a person. For the longest time I wasn't living my true self. I lived in two worlds, the American lifestyle outside of home and the Latino culture at home. I felt like two walls parallel to each other trying to keep me aligned. I never felt enough for the Americans and never felt enough for the Mexicans. Me being the only boy in my immediate family, I had to set an example, I had to think about carrying the family last name, and etc. As an American who is Mexican, I always felt like I was more scrutinized under a microscope than my non-latino counterparts. I had to find ways to circumvent this to allow myself to slightly express myself even in the slightest. I worried so much people would think of me and I felt judged. I let that dictate so much of my life. I was so sad and miserable and asked myself, \"How much more of this can I take?\" All this put me in a negative headspace that hurt me and directly or indirectly hurt others I loved. I still cry thinking about this. I'm still learning how to undo this damage I've caused. It will take time but will it ever go away completely? I'm not sure. Going to therapy has aided in defragmenting so many pieces of my life. And made me realize that, I have to start living my own life and care for my own happiness. Healing has to be a priority.\n\nLurking\n\nIf you've been wondering this whole time what this post is about, yes, this is my coming out post. I've been for years waiting to share this moment in some format. I've thought about sharing on Instagram or Facebook but I decided against this. I'd rather do it on my personal website and any of the decentralized platforms I use. I've watched so many coming out videos, and social media posts of people I know or strangers on the internet. That has been inspiring. I've been lurking the idea of this for so long. I finally brought myself to do this. Once I publish this, there is no going back. Once something is on the internet, it's there forever. I would be lying if I said I wasn't nervous or having second thoughts. I also think about how we live in a time where LGBT rights are under attack. I simply have to do this for myself and face the outcome of this. Positive or negative. So here it is...\n\nMy Sexuality\n\nüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà I'm sharing that I'm a bisexual person. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà\n\nBisexuality is variously defined as romantic or sexual attraction to both males and females, to more than one gender, or attraction to both people of the same gender and different genders.\n\nI am attracted to both men and women. It's a spectrum and there is no 50%-50% split. I feel at this time more attractive to people who identify as male than I am to someone who identifies as female. That varies by day as well. Some of my greatest loves have been women. I'm also open to the attraction towards more gender identities.\n\nHow Long ?\n\nI knew since I was five or six that I felt different about myself. Then the questions of, \"when are you having a girlfriend?\" or \"I bet you have insert number here of girls chasing you!?\" I did want that to happen at many points. Also, I had big crushes on other dudes.\n\nWho have you told?\n\nI've told friends and family who I am as an individual. Every single one of them I've told, each interaction with them was different. Some interactions were very heavy with emotion, some were very easy, and some I felt I was going to die inside because I was afraid of the reaction. Some took time to come around. Everything came alright in the end. I've felt supported. Even if the interaction didn't go as well, I felt the anxiety leave my body and be at a new level of peace with myself. I still tear up thinking about how strong and vulnerable I was in every single interaction. I'm very lucky to have friends and family who are supported. Some mentioned, \"We knew, Pablo. We were waiting for you to share.\" *Queue laughing after ugly crying *. Every moment was beautiful. My relationships have become stronger. I no longer have to hide, in plain sight to my loved ones. They no longer have to see me suffer inside. My family bond has also become stronger. I don't have to hide by putting a wall around me. I can actually be open with them and tell them what I'm feeling.\n\nWhat's to come?\n\nWell, I've been going on dates and meeting lots of people in the community. I have a supported community living in California that makes it a bit easier. I have so much more to learn about myself and make my way. I want to explore my sexuality more and take it to the next level. I don't see my sexuality to be the forefront of my persona. It's a piece of the puzzle that helps form me to be simply, me! I've added this piece to the puzzle. There are other pieces that I have to find their place.\n\nI'm happier with myself now. I can smile an actual smile now. My face isn't hiding behind a mask. I'm starting to live my more authentic self. I'm still going to be me at the end of the day. My sexuality is only one piece of the puzzle of who I am as a person.", "label": "personal"}

I voted in the California Primary for the first time since moving here. I guess I do officially live here. I love how easy it is to vote in person here in Sacramento. The original plan was to submit my mail-in-ballot but I accidentally got my primary ballot soaked when I was carrying my water bottle. Of course, I forgot to request a new one and days went on without thinking about it. Then it dawned on me that today was voting day. I had in my navigation to a specific voting location and on the way there, I saw another polling location. I canceled the navigation and pulled into the polling places I had just driven by. I was so excited because, why go out of my way when I can do it right then and there!\n\nChecking in was easy. I gave my basic information for them to print off the ballot. There was an option to do it electronically but I chose paper instead. I was briefed on where the ballot drop-box was located to place the ballot after I have completed filling it out. My ballot was placed in a secrecy vanilla folder to provide discretion in carrying it between the voting official station and the voting cubicle. After receiving the ballot, I went to a voting station cubicle and filled in my ballot. I voted for those I felt would do good in their current or future positions. I had done some research on the candidates. If you don't, you really should see what each candidate stands for and look at the finer details. Then, once I was satisfied with myself filling in all the ovals, I placed the ballot in the secrecy vanilla folder to prepare to turn it in. I walked across the room to place the ballot in the ballot drop-box.\n\nFinally, I got a sticker to show off that I voted. This time I chose a sticker that says, \"Yo Vot√©\" which is Spanish for, \"I Voted\".\n\nIt was that easy! It seemed very seamless. This really motivates me to pay attention in local elections that help shape the future of the city I am living in. Voting is important and a fundamental right which I am happy to exercise. I'm happy I participated in doing my civic duty to vote. We all have a voice. We are the voice for those who can't.", "label": "personal"}

Everytime, I watch it, it brings me joy thinking about my experiences traveling. Traveling is life changing and it's been life changing for me. It's taught me things, I wouldn't learn staying in one place. Learning about yourself is key for growth. Often, while learning we also learn from people. These people you learn from are strangers. I remember hanging out with strangers in Rome for an entire day. I've roamed around the city of Seoul, Korea with people I met on the bus. You get the idea. Meeting strangers is fun.\n\nI've learned so much from the people I've interacted on my travels. They've shown me their perspective on various topics and provided some life advice as well. All of these people have been strangers. I made a connection with them even if was sitting with them, eating lunch or spending the day with them. I saw their perspective of what it was like to grow up in their city. I've experience them providing a message to their city.

Some of the possible topics include the process of writing, the joys of writing, the frustration some could have, how to improve it, what to write about or people can just showcase what they have written (or see it written on the web) and why they like it. You can also bring your own questions about writing that we can discuss or even trouble shoot. Or you can just listen to other people's ideas. All ways of participating are alright.\n\nThe joys of writing.\n\nWriting helps soothe\n\nMy (sometimes) chaotic process\n\nSince I started to write again, my writing has improved significantly. I've been more expressive as I share with the reader. My writing journey is only just starting. I've broken a few barriers with myself. I still feel that I need to break another layer of myself. Often, I find myself holding back. What am I holding back? Honestly, I over think things too much and that is frustrating. That leads to me sitting on a post for a few days before I touch it again. That if I am determined to finish it, even if it takes me a while look at it. Here is the typical stage of what my writing process goes.\n\nwrite a few words Delete Overthink scream walk away try again, repeat eventually finish the post.\n\nI will admit my writing process is a bit chaotic.

I applied for the Masters of Science in Education in Learning, Design & Technology with an Information Technology Concentration. I chose the IT concentration because, I work in IT where I would like to implement my knowledge at the school level. I'm not in the classroom as often anymore. It seemed more appropriate to go this route.\n\nI'm really excited to go back to school! I've been itching for this for a while. Since, I still work in education, it seems appropriate to also continue my education and better improve my knowledge and skills in addition to what I do already with other forms of learning.\n\nI also value education as well. I want to also have degrees beyond a bachelor's degree. My goal in the near but possibly distance future is to get a doctorate degree. Even with a master's degree, it's been a dream to teach a course or two at the university level. I would teach technology courses specifically for teachers to help eliminate barriers and increase technology literacy for teachers. I would also teach methods for teachers of all ages through scaffolding to embrace technology.\n\nAs a Latino, I find it important to help represent that we can succeed in higher education.\n\nTime to register for classes!", "label": "personal"}

Woo hoo! I've lived on this earth for 29 years. Time flies and I honestly didn't think I would have made it this far but here I am! That being said, I have officially entered my last year of my 20s. It‚Äôs a tad bitter sweet. but the positive overtakes the negative by a long shot. I reflect the growth I‚Äôve had when I entered my 20s.\n\n28 was a fun year of adventures and of learning. It was very fulfilling. I'm smiling as I think of the things I did this year. I would say 28 was a level up in all aspects. I felt more accomplished and I had an increased sense of self-direction.\n\nTraveled with friends\n\nTook myself on Artist Dates\n\nHelped develop a game with Friends\n\nGetting Google Certified in a few areas\n\nVoted in my first California Primary\n\nSang in a few choir concerts\n\n29 will be a great transition year into the next decade of my life. I‚Äôm still discovering who I am as an individual. I now know more about myself than ever. I feel a bit wiser. This has been a year of a lot of reflection.\n\nThere is so much to learn about this world and where I stand in it. I continue to learn from people around me and the things unknown to me. What does it mean to be a Mexican-American at 29 years of age?\n\nA lot will happen this year. Many events this year will have an effect on me directly and indirectly. I am excited and terrified for what's to come. I will keep my head up and fight for the greater good. I've learned not to be anxious of things I can't control yet because they haven't happened yet. Being more in the present is key to the well being of myself.\n\nI've made many mistakes in years past. that I don't want to replicate. There are things I am not proud of but I've come to terms of not living in the past. I don't allow myself to beat myself up as hard as I used to. There's no need spend energy on things that don't matter anymore.\n\nJust learning to love myself this past year and I am continuing to work on myself. I'm in a better place now than when I had just turned 28. My mental health, my physical health, and emotional wellness are more in tune. Now that I've set the path, it's only up for these. I'm more balanced now.\n\nOn a positive note, I'm really excited to start school again. I really value learning and I have a desire to have a master's degree. Later this summer I'm also getting a promotion at work.\n\nSome items I wish to accomplish (no particular order) at 29\n\nLearn Chinese\n\nI WILL join cross fit or attend exercise classes.\n\nI would like to learn to dance.\n\nGet the startup I'm working on off the ground.\n\nWork on personal and work projects that have been on the back burner. I hope to reach these goals.\n\nJoin a LGBT sports league.\n\nGet my financials in order. I should set up a will.\n\nGo on a solo adventure far away from home.\n\nGo on more hikes!\n\nLooking Forward\n\nThere are so many positive things happening in my life. It's only up from here!

This must have been in 2009? (That was a long time ago!) When you're a kid, you slowly discover music that you enjoy and not enjoy. What better way than to expose yourself to other individual's tastes in music? I would hang out with Abraham and Luke. I'd say, they influenced who I am as a person and the direction of my musical tastes.\n\nAbraham grew up in Colombia and moved out to my hometown in Nebraska. Luke grew up in Hawaii and had moved to Nebraska a year before. Both Luke and Abraham played the guitar. I was super excited to have friends who had come from cool places!\n\nI was the only one who didn't play the guitar, much less have a passion for playing an instrument. My friends at the time still took me in and accepted me into the group. It was super duper to watch live shows in my friend's basement. They used to play covers of Subline, Linkin Park, and Bullet for My Valentine.\n\nAt that time frame, I was very interested in photography and videography. I always carried my Sony Cyber-Shot with me because you never know when you would need to get that cool shot. You're probably thinking, \"That's some lame point in shoot!\" When your parents buy you a camera, you have to work with what you got! A camera is a camera!\n\nQuestion time!\n\nCan you guess which role did I play in my friend group? If you guessed the camera guy, you win a cookie! Do you like internet cookies? I don't know how to share a real cookie via the internet.\n\nI would record their guitar sessions on my camera. It was a pretty cool experience getting blasted with hardcore metal while figuring out the best way of recording! I learned important fundamentals of video recording. I focused on stabilizing the camera, considering lighting, and audio clipping (which I had no control over). Not only was I enjoying myself but also I learned a lot.\n\nOne of my favorite memories when we weren't in Luke's basement was walking to get pizza. Living in a small town, things are relatively within walking distance.\n\nAs time went on friends came and went. We all went our different paths even though we lived in the same hometown for years.

Yes, thank you for asking! I'd love to answer your question!\n\nLet me tell you that I'm curious and I like to wander off to other places.

This is especially true when I return to Nebraska. When I land, I'll go with the person who picked me up at the diner after midnight. Going to the diner is a fun adventure when it's snowing, raining, sunny, hot, chilly, or raining cats and dogs!\n\nDiners are also places to meet people who have only met through a virtual medium such as video calls and online groups. Rarely do you meet people in real life (IRL) you get to converse weekly online.\n\nA few weeks ago in July, I met with James G. We both actively participate in the IndieWeb. (You should check it out!) James is a coffee lover and also enjoys writing. He was telling me about a coffee mojito.\n\nJames mentioned a while ago that he was visiting San Francisco for work during Homebrew Website Club. I was very excited to get a coffee and walk around the city. San Francisco is one of my favorite cities\n\nYou're wondering, \"So you two are getting coffee and talking? What 'bout the diner?\" Originally, getting coffee and chatting was the original plan. Then, I remembered that James loves diners and this got my brain juices flowing! WE SHOULD GO TO THE DINER! This is not a drill! I love a good side trip to spice up the adventure. Food and coffee unite people.\n\nI love food and getting caffeinated\n\nDiners are lovely! James loves diners. I've never heard of someone loving diners as much as he does! It makes me very happy!\n\nWe decided to eat at a fine establishment called the Pinecrest Diner. This place is an institution in San Francisco! Imagine a traditional diner restaurant with yummy breakfast food but in SF! The food is so heavenly people wait in line. This place truly hits the spot. They make the food in front of you due to the openness of the space.\n\nWhile eating, we caught up and we discussed various topics of interest. We discussed our visions for our respective personal websites, our current projects, Mozilla, and things to do in San Francisco such as checking out Noisebridge. I also recommended The Museum of Art and Digital Entertainment in Oakland. I enjoyed the discussions and ideas bounced off each other.\n\nThank you James for hanging out! I had a blast!\n\nI hope to see James when I'm on his side of the water. Should I see you at IndieWebCamp San Francisco?", "label": "personal"}

I‚Äôve been starting to get things organized but it almost seems there is no end. I enjoy taking breaks and leaving the apartment. Going on walks around the neighborhood is fun but I always go on an adventure. I‚Äôm getting my steps on and I have fun! I also get a snack or coffee while on an adventure. The sidewalk and my legs are possibly the limit.\n\nEventually, I found myself near Powell Station to take a break. As I was leaning against a wall, I asked myself, ‚ÄúWhat should I do to feel that I live here?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat is cheap but fulfilling?‚Äù\n\nHmm‚Ä¶.\n\nQueue the Jeopardy think music.\n\nYour browser does not support the audio element.\n\nIt came to me! I yelled out loud ‚ÄúI know! I‚Äôll get a library card today!‚Äù Mind you, I‚Äôm at a busy location in the city. I think I started a bit of people waiting for the street car. There could be worse things to be yelling for in a city. Wouldn‚Äôt you get excited if you wanted to get a library card? Going to the library is exciting! I‚Äôm excited to go visit one of the oldest public institutions offered to the public! If I know anything about libraries in big cities, their main branch must be beautiful. Onward to the San Francisco Public Library!\n\nMan! When I walked into the SF Library, it was pretty cool! It‚Äôs pretty modern! There is lots of elbow room to roam around!\n\nAs I‚Äôm walking towards the library, I fill out the online application to start the process and get the confirmation number that I was provided.\n\nThen when I got to the desk, I was asked for this confirmation number, identification, and some proof of where I lived such as a utility bill or lease agreement. The process was super easy. The people working at the library were very friendly.\n\nHere is the library card design that I chose. It was either between the SF Giants or the drawing a second grader. Obviously, I went with the drawing because I don‚Äôt care about baseball. The drawing is pretty cool! Better than I could ever do.\n\nAfter getting my library card, I explored the various floors throughout the library. This place is massive! Various items caught my eye. They let you borrow vinyls! Who does that!? I‚Äôm over the moon!\n\nI didn‚Äôt know that the San Francisco Public Library is a Government Information Center (GIC). It‚Äôs very accessible to get documents from various levels of government.\n\nThe Government Information Center (GIC) provides free access to United States, California, San Francisco, and Bay Area regional agency government documents, and to materials on public policy, political science, public administration, and the law.\n\nI‚Äôll have to spend more time exploring the library system and its website to see how I can maximize the resources available to me. I want to support the library more. This is a lesson to utilize public libraries and other public resources available to constituents.\n\nGetting my library card was an easy experience. Everyone should be able to use the library. I'm excited to be spending a lot of time here! The important thing about the library is you don't have to buy anything to work on things or read a book.\n\nI got to check a book out!\n\nThis blog post was written at the main branch of the San Francisco Library. Thank you for the fast internet. <3", "label": "personal"}

I‚Äôm late writing this post. I saw October was on the topic of multilingualism in a global Web *. I‚Äôm very excited to write about this topic for various reasons. Exciting might be an understatement. I‚Äôm fucking stoked to write a post about languages!\n\nI grew up as a bilingual in Spanish and English. Then, I learned French in school and the whole travel abroad situation. I consider myself fluent in all three languages. I use them often. As someone who speaks multiple languages, I see the world through different lenses. One could argue that the internet itself is another world. This has allowed me to access different parts of the internet that someone who is a monolingual may not ever get to experience much.\n\nWhen I was growing up and started to learn French: I was very happy to find content so easily. One of the shows, * Code Lyoko * was vital in my learning French. I was able to watch able to watch it in all three languages I speak. It helped make connections and differentiate how the characters expressed themselves in their respective language. Being born and raised in the United States, I have to admit that the multilingual has kept me connected with my roots, and my family and has taught me things. It allows my language skills to evolve as time goes on.\n\nI often use the Mexican version of Google to find the news and look up various things about Latin America. I get more direct to the source. I do this to find more accurate reporting on things happening. When things about Mexico get reported in American media, I often question various aspects of the reporting. American media tends to picture Mexico as this scary place as a whole.\n\nWhen I was a kid, It was hard to find information about my parents‚Äô hometown in Mexico. Trying to find detailed information in English was next to impossible. Wikipedia in Spanish is always a great place to start! It‚Äôs so much more satisfying as the page has more information and a lot more footnotes. What better place than to look at a website by the Mexican government to give me the census data of my parent‚Äôs hometown? You can‚Äôt find this information in English!\n\nThe web shouldn‚Äôt be dominated by the English language. I‚Äôm aware it‚Äôs the lingua franca. The internet is becoming homogenized. A world being homogenized is a terrifying thing to think about. We‚Äôre losing so much culture. So much perspective. Think of it this way: the internet is losing its spice. It‚Äôs becoming bland. We should be proud of the languages we can present ourselves in. That‚Äôs what makes the internet fun! Does everything need to be in English? Absolutely N-O-T!\n\nI must admit that I am guilty of not writing as often in different languages. I do write the occasional post in Spanish or French. At the same time, I feel as if I‚Äôm contributing to the situation. This month‚Äôs topic has motivated me to continue to write in Spanish and French more. I want to continue to express myself. It‚Äôs important to write in different languages other than English. When I write in different languages, I express myself as me but at the same time, it‚Äôs a different me. French Pablo presents himself differently from Spanish or English Pablo.\n\nThank you ~zinricky for hosting this month‚Äôs IndieWeb Carnival on multilingualism in a global Web", "label": "personal"}

The last time I ice skated was back in Omaha. It's something I don't do often but I've been having an itch the last few years. Living in Downtown San Francisco, there's an Ice skating rink at Union Square that I pass by all the time. It's been one of those activities that I tell myself, \"I need to do this before they tear it down!\" I keep pondering everytime I pass it, then I forget because I have to get to my destination.\n\nThis weekend, I finally did it! I went with my friend Tim, who was visiting for the weekend. Why not do something interesting with a friend? I was very happy that I went with my friend!\n\nMy biggest achievement is I didn't fall on my face!

I also don't wan't to give too many spoilers.\n\nBooks:\n\nA Thousand Splendid Suns - Khaled Hosseini\n\nMaus / Maus II - Art Spiegelman\n\nA graphic novel where Spiegelman interviews his father about his experiences as a Polish Jew and Holocaust survivor. *I really enjoyed the various themes in the book.\n\nThis is a must read\n\n1984 - George Orwell\n\nThis taught me many lessons and how eerie this period of time is currently. I'm pretty scared for what's to come.\n\nThe Odyssey - Homer\n\nMany of the themes taught me some important lessons.\n\nIn The Hot Zone - Kevin Sites\n\nThis wasn't my favorite book but it made me aware of various wars and situations happening beyond Iraq.\n\nLady of the Lake - Sir Walter Scott\n\nYeruldelgger - Ian Manook (French)\n\nThis book me realize I can actually read French.\n\nRyan White My Own Story - Ryan White\n\nRyan White has always been an inspiration to me as I have in various periods of my life been involved with bringing awareness about HIV/AIDS. It fascinated me how well-versed Ryan was and his outlook on life as he was very unlucky getting the virus from tainted blood products.\n\nLe Gone du Cha√¢ba - Azouz Begag (French)\n\nLe Gone du Cha√¢ba (The Kid of the Chaaba), translated into English as Shantytown Kid by Naima Wolf.\n\nI love this book as it shows the struggles of balancing two different cultures - the country you live in and the culture at home. This book understood me in various ways as I struggled to balance US life and my Mexican culture.\n\nMy French Professor gave me this book as a graduation gift.\n\nRemaking Manhood: Stories From the Front Lines of Change - Mark Greene\n\nI read this book right before I graduated college. Being a male teacher is very important as many students don't have a good male role model at home. I made it a goal in my teaching to help my students not fall for certain behaviors.\n\nThis book also helped me reevaluate my relationships and look deep inside of me.\n\nHere's a good link related to Remaking Manhood\n\nWinning the War On War - Joshua S. Goldstein\n\nI minored in International Studies and this book really opened me up to deeper issues that continue to exist.\n\nConstructive Living - David K. Reynolds\n\nAlthough this book wasn't the solution to many of my problems during some very dark times, it has helped me address them and find the right direction. It has helped me get out of the rut.\n\nJourney To The Future: A Roadmap for Success for Youth - Consuelo Castillo Kickbusch (Author)\n\nThis book has helped me in various ways to get where I am today.

I will create a round up post and i will update this blog post with the replies I receive!\n\nWhat is self-expression?\n\nThat depends\n\nself-expression (noun)\n\nself-ex¬∑‚Äãpres¬∑‚Äãsion Àåself-ik-Ààspre-sh…ôn\n\nThe expression of one's personality : assertion of one's individual traits\n\nSelf-expression comes in various forms. It manifests differently in every person. There is no single route to how people develop how they become. People express themselves loudly, quietly, non-verbally, or in any other way. Many things influence us in our lives. The environment we grew up in influences how we present to the world. Our cultural backgrounds, the countries we've lived in, the languages we speak, or the type of supportive friends we have in our lives are all the ingredients that build the recipe for who we become and how we share our personalities with the world.\n\nFor me, I love speaking languages! I love playing games in French and being super duper competitive. I love reading in Spanish!\n\nI grew up in a Mexican household which has greatly influenced my ways of self-expression. I love speaking with more emotion at home and being surrounded by people with my cultural background. An example of this is when I am angry, I will cuss in Spanish like no other. I feel so much better after letting it all out. This Instagram reel in Spanish will tell you what I mean.\n\nThe Mexican culture influences my American side and vice versa. I would consider myself very expressive in English. Ever since I was a kid, I loved saying, \"That's so cute\" or \"That flower is so pretty.\" Sharing your emotions is very beautiful. Don't be afraid of saying things out loud like this. Fuck that toxic masculinity garbage!\n\nI love blogging and journaling. I love having a journal - getting lost in my thoughts while jotting them down on beautiful lined or dotted paper on a park bench or sitting crisscross applesauce on the top of a building in San Francisco. I love sharing my thoughts publicly blogging or quietly on paper. Not all forms of expression have to be public. Self-expression also includes time when it's you and only you involved. This includes recording audio notes, coding your new blog engine, or building an arcade cabinet. Alone time is self-expression.\n\nAs I've become older, I've stopped caring as much about what people perceive of me (or what I thought people perceived of me) in the things that interest me. Self-expression is about how comfortable you can be with yourself. It comes down to loving yourself more every day. I love dressing in bright colors, especially on a nice sunny day. It makes me feel great and brightens my mood. Heck, find me wearing the brightest pink shirt out in public in the streets of San Francisco.\n\nHow you view self-expression is open to interpretation. How do you self-express?\n\nHere are some questions to get you started to get the juices flowing:\n\nHow do you present yourself to the world?\n\nWhat does self-expression do for you?\n\nDo you use self-expression as a coping mechanism?\n\nWhat has been your journey to becoming a more expressive version of yourself?\n\nIf your family culture is different from the country that you live in, how do you balance your self-expression? Are they intertwined?\n\nAlso posted on IndieNews\n\nSubmissions", "label": "personal"}

{"title": "30", "url": "https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/30", "content": "30\n\nPablo doing the peace sign with fingers.\n\nThis post was written in English (en_US).\n\nToday, I turn 30 years old. Woohoo! I guess I‚Äôm no longer a 20-something-year-old. These last 10 years have flown by quickly but man, have they been memorable. It‚Äôs a tad bitter sweet. The positive overtakes the negative by a long shot. I can‚Äôt stop the aging process. If only it were that easy!\n\nHonestly, at this very moment, I don‚Äôt feel any different. I still feel energetic and craving adventure. I think these song lyrics from T-Swizzle describe how I feel.\n\n(Hey!) I don't know about you But I'm feeling twenty-two\n\nIn hindsight, looking at myself in the mirror more recently, I notice my facial hair is starting to turn white. Nothing like a fresh shave that still makes me look young and boyish. I must being doing something right with my skin routine (and maybe good genes from my parents)!\n\nReflections\n\nI reflect on the growth I‚Äôve had since I entered my 20s. My 20s were about\n\nLearning\n\nFalling and rising\n\nGoing on adventures.\n\nLoved ones\n\nI learned some great lessons along the way. Some lessons were not so easy to swallow. Man, did I learn. There are so many things I know now that I wish a 20-year-old me knew. One of the things I wish he knew was, ‚ÄúLove yourself more!‚Äù I do love myself more than ever. I‚Äôm happier with who I‚Äôve become. I‚Äôm not done learning who I become. I don‚Äôt think that ever stops. There were many moments in life when I hit my absolute lowest. Those are moments I‚Äôm not proud of. While I did manage to get myself out of them, I did come back stronger. Another lesson here - ask for help and use the resources available to you. You‚Äôre not alone, I promise.\n\nTake risks! Take more! I'm thrilled to have moved to California. I still can‚Äôt believe that this guy from Nebraska moved to San Francisco. I was grateful to have gone on so many adventures. I learned so much about myself getting away. Some of my best learning moments have been from strangers and experiences with myself in another country. Who knew you could learn something so new about yourself at 3 am while eating a d√µner kebab on the streets of Berlin?\n\nWhen I was in my early 20s, I said something along the lines of, ‚ÄúI get to be away from my parents! Freedom!‚Äù When I was in college, I didn‚Äôt want to come home as often, or if I went home to visit, I would not stay for too long. Now more than ever, I miss my parents. Now, I live far away from them. I only get to have home-cooked meals a few times a year. It honestly makes me sad watching them get older. I still need my parents. I do my best to call every day. My relationship with them has been stronger than ever. I am thankful for all the things they‚Äôve done for me and my siblings\n\nWho‚Äôs cutting the internet onions on here?\n\nTravel\n\nI‚Äôm very fortunate that I traveled a lot in my 20s. I want to thank my parents for taking us to Mexico as a young kid.\n\nI‚Äôve traveled to Canada, all over Europe, South Korea, Mexico, and various parts of the United States.\n\nTravel Buddies\n\nI got to travel with my favorite travel buddies, Sammy and Manny! We've have gone on some wild adventures. I‚Äôm very happy we stayed friends. Best travel buddies ever!\n\nBest Birthday Ever! - Czech Republic\n\nOne of my favorite birthdays was when I was studying abroad in Europe. I visited my friends in the Czech Republic.\n\nPablo‚Äôs 22nd birthday in 2017 in Czech Republic]\n\nFriends\n\nI‚Äôve made an amazing community of friends. People, I consider my family away from home. Learning from people whom I loved, making friends wherever I go! I‚Äôve made so many friends.\n\nWhat goals do I have in my 30s?\n\nThere are a lot of things I want to accomplish during my 30s. I have a vision for the next few years! I‚Äôm hopeful I can find the right path to reach my goals\n\nEducation\n\nI truly value education. It got me where I am today! I was very fortunate to receive a great public school education. Others also need to have access to a great public school education. We must fight against the privatization of the education system. I want to continue to fight for public education. Public education provided me with so many opportunities.\n\nI am currently doing my master‚Äôs degree at the University of Nebraska Kearney. My goal one day is to teach a class or two at the university level. It would be awesome to guide future teachers and help them be confident with technology use and go beyond 21st-century learning. I do miss being in the classroom.\n\nI would like to receive a PhD.\n\nI also want to improve my programming skills.\n\nHealth\n\nI‚Äôm working towards getting in better shape and thinking of long-term health. As I age, I know I won‚Äôt bounce back from injury as quickly. I know I must do everything in my power to take control of my health. Preventative measures are what will keep the hospital away. Mental health is just as important.\n\nAdventures\n\nI want to continue traveling. I want to visit more parts of the world. Ever since I last renewed my passport, the visa pages have been blank. The passport I had in my early twenties was pretty full. It‚Äôs so satisfying to look at the stamps and stickers on each page. I want to take my parents on a fun adventure as well\n\nStartup\n\nI‚Äôve been helping a friend with a startup and launching an idea that we have. I am hopeful this year will be great!\n\nFinancial Independence\n\nI want to make smarter choices with money. I‚Äôve been reading up on financial literature to become better with money. Times are changing, and I must keep up with inflation, changing markets, AI, etc.\n\nLooking Forward\n\nOverall, things are finally clicking. I‚Äôm excited for what‚Äôs to come and all the things to learn. I will reevaluate and reprioritize many things in life.\n\nWhat have you learned in your 30s?\n\nHow am I celebrating my birthday?\n\nLuckily, I live in San Francisco, so there‚Äôs a lot to do! I will be celebrating the entire weekend with my friends in San Francisco! So stoked to watch Drag Disco with Trixie Mattel! Let‚Äôs put on some pink clothes and dance into my 30s!", "label": "personal"}

Intrigued by the limits of generative artificial intelligence (AI), he had asked ChatGPT to give him the names of the 12 novels he had written. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve only written nine,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAlways eager to please, it decided to invent three.‚Äù The ‚Äúnine inches‚Äù from the fake title it hallucinated was stolen from a filthy Robert Burns poem. ‚ÄúI just distrust these systems when it comes to truth,‚Äù says Morrison. He is yet to write Nine Inches ‚Äì ‚Äúor its sequel, Eighteen Inches‚Äù, he laughs. His actual latest book, For Emma, imagining AI brain-implant chips, is about the human costs of technology.\n\nMorrison keeps an eye on the machines, such as OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT, and their capabilities, but he refuses to use them in his own life and work. He is one of a growing number of people who are actively resisting: people who are terrified of the power of generative AI and its potential for harm and don‚Äôt want to feed the beast; those who have just decided that it‚Äôs a bit rubbish, and more trouble than it‚Äôs worth; and those who simply prefer humans to robots.\n\nGo online, and it‚Äôs easy to find AI proponents who dismiss refuseniks as ignorant luddites ‚Äì or worse, smug hipsters. I possibly fall into both camps, given that I have decidedly Amish interests (board games, gardening, animal husbandry) and write for the Guardian. Friends swear by ChatGPT for parenting advice, and I know someone who uses it all day for work in her consultancy business, but I haven‚Äôt used it since playing around after it launched in 2022. Admittedly ChatGPT might have done a better job, but this piece was handcrafted using organic words from my artisanal writing studio. (OK, I mean bed.) I could have assumed my interviewees‚Äô thoughts from plundering their social media posts and research papers, as ChatGPT would have done, but it was far more enjoyable to pick up the phone and talk, human to human. Two of my interviewees were interrupted by their pets, and each made me laugh in some way (full disclosure: AI then transcribed the noise).\n\nView image in fullscreen Ewan Morrison: ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a product of venture capital gone nuts‚Äô Photograph: Roberto Ricciuti/Getty Images\n\nOn X, where Morrison sometimes clashes with AI enthusiasts, a common insult is ‚Äúdecel‚Äù (decelerationist), but it makes him laugh when people think he‚Äôs the one who isn‚Äôt keeping up. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing [that stops] accelerationism more than failure to deliver on what you promised. Hitting a brick wall is a good way to decelerate,‚Äù he says. One recent study found that AI answered more than 60% of queries inaccurately.\n\nMorrison was drawn into the argument by what he would now call ‚Äúalarmist fears about the potential for superintelligence and runaway AI. The more I‚Äôve got into it, the more I realise that‚Äôs a fiction that‚Äôs been dangled before the investors of the world, so they‚Äôll invest billions ‚Äì in fact, half a trillion ‚Äì into this quest for artificial superintelligence. It‚Äôs a fantasy, a product of venture capital gone nuts.‚Äù\n\nThere are also copyright violations ‚Äì generative AI is trained on existing material ‚Äì that threaten him as a writer, and his wife, screenwriter Emily Ballou. In the entertainment industry, he says, people are using ‚ÄúAI algorithms to determine what projects get the go-ahead, and that means we‚Äôre stuck remaking the past. The algorithms say ‚ÄòMore of the same‚Äô, because it‚Äôs all they can do.‚Äù\n\nI read because I want to understand how somebody sees the world. There‚Äôs no ‚Äòsomebody‚Äô in the synthetic text-extruding machines\n\nMorrison says he has a long list of complaints. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been stacking up over the past few years.‚Äù He is concerned about the job losses (Bill Gates recently predicted AI would lead to a two-day work week). Then there are ‚Äútech addiction, the ecological impact, the damage to the education system ‚Äì 92% of students are now using AI‚Äù. He worries about the way tech companies spy on us to make AI personalised, and is horrified at AI-enabled weapons being used in Ukraine. ‚ÄúI find that ethically revolting.‚Äù\n\nOthers cite similar reasons for not using AI. April Doty, an audiobook narrator, is appalled at the environmental cost ‚Äì the computational power required to perform an AI search and answer is huge. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm infuriated that you can‚Äôt turn off the AI overviews in Google search,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWhenever you look anything up now you‚Äôre basically torching the planet.‚Äù She has started to use other search engines. ‚ÄúBut, more and more, we‚Äôre surrounded by it, and there‚Äôs no off switch. That makes me angry.‚Äù Where she still can, she says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm opting out of using AI.‚Äù\n\nView image in fullscreen Illustration: Kaan Illustration/The Guardian\n\nIn her own field, she is concerned about the number of books that are being ‚Äúread‚Äù by machines. Audible, the Amazon-owned audiobook provider, has just announced it will allow publishers to create audiobooks using its AI technology. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know anybody who wants a robot to read them a story, but I am concerned that it is going to ruin the experience to the point where people don‚Äôt want to subscribe to audiobook platforms any more,‚Äù says Doty. She hasn‚Äôt lost jobs to AI yet but other colleagues have, and chances are, it will happen. AI models can‚Äôt ‚Äúnarrate‚Äù, she says. ‚ÄúNarrators don‚Äôt just read words; they sense and express the feelings beneath the words. AI can never do this job because it requires decades of experience in being a human being.‚Äù\n\nEmily M Bender, professor of linguistics at the University of Washington and co-author of a new book, The AI Con, has many reasons why she doesn‚Äôt want to use large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. ‚ÄúBut maybe the first one is that I‚Äôm not interested in reading something that nobody wrote,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI read because I want to understand how somebody sees something, and there‚Äôs no ‚Äòsomebody‚Äô inside the synthetic text-extruding machines.‚Äù It‚Äôs just a papier-mache made from lots of different people‚Äôs words, she says.\n\nDoes she feel she is being ‚Äúleft behind‚Äù, as AI enthusiasts would say? ‚ÄúNo, not at all. My reaction to that is, ‚ÄòWhere‚Äôs everybody going?‚Äô‚Äù She laughs as if to say: nowhere good.\n\n‚ÄúWhen we turn to synthetic media rather than authentic media, we are losing out on human connection,‚Äù says Bender. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs both at a personal level ‚Äì what we get out of connecting to other people ‚Äì and in terms of strength of community.‚Äù She cites Chris Gilliard, the surveillance and privacy researcher. ‚ÄúHe made the very important point that you can see this as a technological move by the companies to isolate us from each other, and to set things up so that all of our interactions are mediated through their products. We don‚Äôt need that, for us or our communities.‚Äù\n\nDespite Bender‚Äôs well-publicised position ‚Äì she has long been a high-profile critic of LLMs ‚Äì incredibly, she has seen students turn in AI-generated work. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs very sad.‚Äù She doesn‚Äôt want to be policing, or even blaming, students. ‚ÄúMy job is to make sure students understand why it is that turning to a large language model is depriving themselves of a learning opportunity, in terms of what they would get out of doing the work.‚Äù\n\nDoes she think people should boycott generative AI? ‚ÄúBoycott suggests organised political action, and sure, why not?‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI also think that people are individually better off if they don‚Äôt use them.‚Äù\n\nI almost feel I have no choice but to use AI at this point. I might have to put morals aside\n\nSome people have so far held out, but are reluctantly realising they may end up using it. Tom, who works in IT for the government, doesn‚Äôt use AI in his tech work, but found colleagues were using it in other ways. Promotion is partly decided on annual appraisals they have to write, and he had asked a manager whose appraisal had impressed him how he‚Äôd done it, thinking he‚Äôd spent days on it. ‚ÄúHe said, ‚ÄòI just spent 10 minutes ‚Äì I used ChatGPT,‚Äô‚Äù Tom recalls. ‚ÄúHe suggested I should do the same, which I don‚Äôt agree with. I made that point, and he said, ‚ÄòWell, you‚Äôre probably not going to get anywhere unless you do.‚Äô‚Äù Using AI would feel like cheating, but Tom worries refusing to do so now puts him at a disadvantage. ‚ÄúI almost feel like I have no choice but to use it at this point. I might have to put morals aside.‚Äù\n\nOthers, despite their misgivings, limit how they use it, and only for specific tasks. Steve Royle, professor of cell biology at the University of Warwick, uses ChatGPT for the ‚Äúgrunt work‚Äù of writing computer code to analyse data. ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs really the limit. I don‚Äôt want it to generate code from scratch. When you let it do that, you spend way more time debugging it afterwards. My view is, it‚Äôs a waste of time if you let it try and do too much for you.‚Äù Accurate or not, he also worries that if he becomes too reliant on AI, his coding skills will atrophy. ‚ÄúThe AI enthusiasts say, ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt worry, eventually nobody will need to know anything.‚Äô I don‚Äôt subscribe to that.‚Äù\n\nView image in fullscreen Justine Bateman: ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs one of the worst ideas society has ever come up with‚Äô Photograph: NBC/Nathan Congleton/Getty Images\n\nPart of his job is to write research papers and grant proposals. ‚ÄúI absolutely will not use it for generating any text,‚Äù says Royle. ‚ÄúFor me, in the process of writing, you formulate your ideas, and by rewriting and editing, it really crystallises what you want to say. Having a machine do that is not what it‚Äôs about.‚Äù\n\nGenerative AI, says film-maker and writer Justine Bateman, ‚Äúis one of the worst ideas society has ever come up with‚Äù. She says she despises how it incapacitates us. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre trying to convince people they can‚Äôt do the things they‚Äôve been doing easily for years ‚Äì to write emails, to write a presentation. Your daughter wants you to make up a bedtime story about puppies ‚Äì to write that for you.‚Äù We will get to the point, she says with a grim laugh, ‚Äúthat you will essentially become just a skin bag of organs and bones, nothing else. You won‚Äôt know anything and you will be told repeatedly that you can‚Äôt do it, which is the opposite of what life has to offer. Capitulating all kinds of decisions like where to go on vacation, what to wear today, who to date, what to eat. People are already doing this. You won‚Äôt have to process grief, because you‚Äôll have uploaded photos and voice messages from your mother who just died, and then she can talk to you via AI video call every day. One of the ways it‚Äôs going to destroy humans, long before there‚Äôs a nuclear disaster, is going to be the emotional hollowing-out of people.‚Äù\n\nWe keep moving like zombies towards a world that nobody really wants to live in\n\nShe is not interested. ‚ÄúIt is the complete opposite direction of where I‚Äôm going as a film-maker and author. Generative AI is like a blender ‚Äì you put in millions of examples of the type of thing you want and it will give you a Frankenstein spoonful of it.‚Äù It‚Äôs theft, she says, and regurgitation. ‚ÄúNothing original will come out of it, by the nature of what it is. Anyone who uses generative AI, who thinks they‚Äôre an artist, is stopping their creativity.‚Äù\n\nSome studios, such as the animation company Studio Ghibli, have sworn off using AI, but others appear to be salivating at the prospect. In 2023, Dreamworks founder Jeffrey Katzenberg said AI would cut the costs of its animated films by 90%. Bateman thinks audiences will tire of AI-created content. ‚ÄúHuman beings will react to this in the way they react to junk food,‚Äù she says. Deliciously artificial to some, if not nourishing ‚Äì but many of us will turn off. Last year she set up an organisation, Credo 23, and a film festival, to showcase films made without AI. She likens it to an ‚Äúorganic stamp for films, that tells the audience no AI was used.‚Äù People, she says, will ‚Äúhunger for something raw, real and human‚Äù.\n\nIn everyday life, Bateman is trying ‚Äúto be in a parallel universe, where I‚Äôm trying to avoid [AI] as much as possible.‚Äù It‚Äôs not that she is anti-tech, she stresses. ‚ÄúI have a computer science degree, I love tech.

But I‚Äôm not having a crisis about my personal life choices‚Ä¶ instead I‚Äôm having a crisis of generational impotence. I‚Äôm tired of waiting for my generation‚Äôs turn, which I am less and less convinced will come in time to make a difference, especially since GenZ seems to be going conservative üòë\n\nOuter South by Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band\n\nI finally got letters back from two of my reps:\n\nSenator Murray, 74yo and in office since 1993 when I was in third grade, wants me to know that she ‚Äúremain[s] committed to continuing to work with [her] colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find ways to make progress on immigration reform.‚Äù Thank you for your complacency Senator. I don‚Äôt know how immigration progress will be made with isolationist Nazis tbh üßê I don‚Äôt get why Dems are taking conservative immigration stances when in my mind the problem is we are too strict on immigration, and should let in more people. There, birth rate ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù solved too! What I want to know now is, what are the Senator‚Äôs plans for retirement?\n\nRepresentative DelBene‚Äôs office thinks I ‚Äúmay be pleased to know that [she] joined [her] Democratic colleagues in sending a letter to President Trump expressing serious concern about Mr. Abrego Garcia‚Äôs case and requesting an immediate update on his wellbeing and how the administration plans to ensure his safe return to the United States.‚Äù I am, in fact, not pleased. I am the opposite of pleased. Is she fucking with me? Does she not go on the Internet? In what world am I satisfied that she signed a strongly worded letter and called it good?\n\nMy resentment towards 80yo politicians who won‚Äôt retire and pass their power to the next generation is reaching a rolling boil as the Democrats in charge apparently don‚Äôt have an ounce of urgency left in their moldering bodies. I have to think it‚Äôs intentional, especially given the way Nancy and co blocked Millennial AOC from a position of power in favor of an old dude with cancer who just died from it (‚ÄúGerry‚Äôs a young 74, cancer notwithstanding‚Äù üôÑüôÑüôÑ); I think Boomer politicians know how badly they‚Äôve fucked over everyone younger than them, and they will literally hold power until they die to prevent facing justice. (Yeah I‚Äôm making it generational, they‚Äôve been demonizing Millennials to avoid looking in the mirror for decades.) They booted 25yo David Hogg from DNC leadership as punishment for suggesting the party should not always support incumbents, making a mockery of DEI principles by using gender equality rules to invalidate his election.\n\nA friend and I just looked it up: Nancy Pelosi was first elected in 1987. She has been in power for basically my entire life. And I am turning 40. Her legacy, in my mind? Losing women the right to bodily autonomy, for not taking Republicans seriously and doing anything about it when she could have. OK fine she did get us the ACA. Thanks lady. But it‚Äôs time to go home, get some rest, and let someone else have a turn! (Sorry Bernie, I love ya man, but you too!!!)\n\nI think those in charge should have some stakes in the game. If you‚Äôre already past the actuarial tables, you shouldn‚Äôt get to make decisions for the rest of us who are going to live in the world our politicians make for potentially decades. (I expect the Supreme Court will be ultra conservative for the rest of my life because Dems wouldn‚Äôt dare trying to expand it.) Be a mentor, yes, please! But give up the power. Normal retirement age is 67. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ageist to suggest it might be time for someone two decades past retirement age to pass the torch.\n\nGive me a party with energy, give me politicians who fight! Oh, for an opposition party ü•∫ I don‚Äôt have to agree 100% with them, if they‚Äôd just have some gumption. Give me AOC energy, Shawn Fain energy, Pete Buttigieg (!) energy, Cory Booker energy, Chris Van Hollen energy, Kat Abughazaleh energy. Not whatever this pathetic excuse for ‚Äúleadership‚Äù is. Walz had the energy and they told him to stuff it. Brilliant strategy guys.\n\nPlease, please tell me someone is primarying all my Federal reps next election, because I will vote for anyone who shows some semblance of spine üò°", "label": "personal"}

These last 10 years have flown by quickly but man, have they been memorable. It‚Äôs a tad bitter sweet. The positive overtakes the negative by a long shot. I can‚Äôt stop the aging process. If only it were that easy!\n\nHonestly, at this very moment, I don‚Äôt feel any different. I still feel energetic and craving adventure. I think these song lyrics from T-Swizzle describe how I feel.\n\n(Hey!) I don't know about you But I'm feeling twenty-two\n\nIn hindsight, looking at myself in the mirror more recently, I notice my facial hair is starting to turn white. Nothing like a fresh shave that still makes me look young and boyish. I must being doing something right with my skin routine (and maybe good genes from my parents)!\n\nReflections\n\nI reflect on the growth I‚Äôve had since I entered my 20s. My 20s were about\n\nLearning\n\nFalling and rising\n\nGoing on adventures.\n\nLoved ones\n\nI learned some great lessons along the way. Some lessons were not so easy to swallow. Man, did I learn. There are so many things I know now that I wish a 20-year-old me knew. One of the things I wish he knew was, ‚ÄúLove yourself more!‚Äù I do love myself more than ever. I‚Äôm happier with who I‚Äôve become. I‚Äôm not done learning who I become. I don‚Äôt think that ever stops. There were many moments in life when I hit my absolute lowest. Those are moments I‚Äôm not proud of. While I did manage to get myself out of them, I did come back stronger. Another lesson here - ask for help and use the resources available to you. You‚Äôre not alone, I promise.\n\nTake risks! Take more! I'm thrilled to have moved to California. I still can‚Äôt believe that this guy from Nebraska moved to San Francisco. I was grateful to have gone on so many adventures. I learned so much about myself getting away. Some of my best learning moments have been from strangers and experiences with myself in another country. Who knew you could learn something so new about yourself at 3 am while eating a d√µner kebab on the streets of Berlin?\n\nWhen I was in my early 20s, I said something along the lines of, ‚ÄúI get to be away from my parents! Freedom!‚Äù When I was in college, I didn‚Äôt want to come home as often, or if I went home to visit, I would not stay for too long. Now more than ever, I miss my parents. Now, I live far away from them. I only get to have home-cooked meals a few times a year. It honestly makes me sad watching them get older. I still need my parents. I do my best to call every day. My relationship with them has been stronger than ever. I am thankful for all the things they‚Äôve done for me and my siblings\n\nWho‚Äôs cutting the internet onions on here?\n\nTravel\n\nI‚Äôm very fortunate that I traveled a lot in my 20s. I want to thank my parents for taking us to Mexico as a young kid.\n\nI‚Äôve traveled to Canada, all over Europe, South Korea, Mexico, and various parts of the United States.\n\nTravel Buddies\n\nI got to travel with my favorite travel buddies, Sammy and Manny! We've have gone on some wild adventures. I‚Äôm very happy we stayed friends. Best travel buddies ever!\n\nBest Birthday Ever! - Czech Republic\n\nOne of my favorite birthdays was when I was studying abroad in Europe. I visited my friends in the Czech Republic.\n\nPablo‚Äôs 22nd birthday in 2017 in Czech Republic]\n\nFriends\n\nI‚Äôve made an amazing community of friends. People, I consider my family away from home. Learning from people whom I loved, making friends wherever I go! I‚Äôve made so many friends.\n\nWhat goals do I have in my 30s?\n\nThere are a lot of things I want to accomplish during my 30s. I have a vision for the next few years! I‚Äôm hopeful I can find the right path to reach my goals\n\nEducation\n\nI truly value education. It got me where I am today! I was very fortunate to receive a great public school education. Others also need to have access to a great public school education. We must fight against the privatization of the education system. I want to continue to fight for public education. Public education provided me with so many opportunities.\n\nI am currently doing my master‚Äôs degree at the University of Nebraska Kearney. My goal one day is to teach a class or two at the university level. It would be awesome to guide future teachers and help them be confident with technology use and go beyond 21st-century learning. I do miss being in the classroom.\n\nI would like to receive a PhD.\n\nI also want to improve my programming skills.\n\nHealth\n\nI‚Äôm working towards getting in better shape and thinking of long-term health. As I age, I know I won‚Äôt bounce back from injury as quickly. I know I must do everything in my power to take control of my health. Preventative measures are what will keep the hospital away. Mental health is just as important.\n\nAdventures\n\nI want to continue traveling. I want to visit more parts of the world. Ever since I last renewed my passport, the visa pages have been blank. The passport I had in my early twenties was pretty full. It‚Äôs so satisfying to look at the stamps and stickers on each page. I want to take my parents on a fun adventure as well\n\nStartup\n\nI‚Äôve been helping a friend with a startup and launching an idea that we have. I am hopeful this year will be great!\n\nFinancial Independence\n\nI want to make smarter choices with money. I‚Äôve been reading up on financial literature to become better with money. Times are changing, and I must keep up with inflation, changing markets, AI, etc.\n\nLooking Forward\n\nOverall, things are finally clicking. I‚Äôm excited for what‚Äôs to come and all the things to learn. I will reevaluate and reprioritize many things in life.\n\nWhat have you learned in your 30s?\n\nHow am I celebrating my birthday?\n\nLuckily, I live in San Francisco, so there‚Äôs a lot to do! I will be celebrating the entire weekend with my friends in San Francisco! So stoked to watch Drag Disco with Trixie Mattel!

It wasn‚Äôt ever as big as my parent‚Äôs, but I had ~50-70 jazz CDs (donated to the local HS music department so hopefully someone‚Äôs still using them) plus probably a hundred albums. Some indie shit I probably couldn‚Äôt replace if I wanted (I like to think I‚Äôve become slightly more thoughtful about what I give away in my wiser 30s üòÇ).\n\nBut to be fair, my listening has shifted a lot since college, so the music I listen to most I don‚Äôt have on CD, and I got rid of a bunch of albums that I had kinda outgrown, so maybe it‚Äôs not a bad thing.

They both really needed replacing. We‚Äôd hoped to have it done before the winter started since our furnace had already been on the fritz for several years ‚Äî but the equipment was on backorder.\n\nMy energy utility, Puget Sound Energy (PSE), wants people to stay on gas, so there weren‚Äôt incentives from them for this switch; however, my city developed a bulk purchase and incentive program to assist homeowners in transitioning to support the community‚Äôs climate goals. This upgrade electrified our whole house, so we could shut off our gas service!*\n\nNow that I‚Äôve had a heat pump for a year, I wanted to share my experience, because I had questions and misconceptions that I didn‚Äôt get answered beforehand. Tl;dr it‚Äôs great, especially the cooling, just works a little differently.\n\n(Heads-up: 2500 word post, but it‚Äôs got graphs! ü§©)\n\n*Technically we still have a gas fireplace installed, but we never used it. PSE said it was safe to simply turn off even if that means there might be a small amount of gas remaining in the pipes under the house.\n\nWhy we got a heat pump\n\nOur old setup was failing\n\nBefore the upgrade, we had a ~20 year old gas furnace and an old gas water heater. In November 2019, a pipe on our water heater ruptured, spraying a ton of scalding water into our garage ceiling, filling the entire garage with steam that we had to hire a company to install fans for days to dry out. After that, the furnace began to fail regularly, falsely tripping the safety shut-off and needing to be restarted multiple times a day. We had people out to fix it multiple times, but the most they could figure was that something inside was corroded and they‚Äôd clean it to buy us another few months.\n\nMy husband‚Äôs telecommuted for years, and during the pandemic, I started working from home too ‚Äî but the only ‚Äúcooling‚Äù we had was a ceiling fan in our living room and dining room. We bought a used portable electric window A/C unit to keep my husband‚Äôs office from turning into an inferno, and hefted it down the hall to our bedroom in the evenings. Less than ideal.\n\nNatural gas is terrible for the planet and for people\n\n‚ÄúNatural gas‚Äù is the greenwashed industry name for methane, an extremely potent greenhouse gas. A lot of methane is fracked, which may have impacts on the health of surrounding communities. Methane is piped, often through First Nation people‚Äôs lands without permission ‚Äî think Keystone XL and Canada‚Äôs Coastal GasLink pipeline ‚Äî where it may leak and harm the water and ecosystem. Also, some methane leaks during fracking and distribution, contributing to emissions.\n\nMoreover, ‚Äúnatural gas‚Äù is propped up by corporate propaganda that cooking with gas is better than electric, despite the atrocious impact methane has on indoor air quality and its contribution to household emissions. I have an electric stove, so I didn‚Äôt have to replace mine in order to get off gas.\n\nWithout gas-burning appliances, our risk of carbon monoxide poisoning is lowered; it would come from some other source, like operating a propane stove indoors (DO NOT DO THAT THING). My husband knows someone who has brain damage from carbon monoxide poisoning!\n\nBasically, ‚Äúnatural gas‚Äù is fucking shit and I want fucking nothing to do with it.\n\nMy new all-electric home energy setup\n\nMy house is about 1400s.f. and has two stories. It was built in the 1980s and our attic doesn‚Äôt have enough insulation (we‚Äôve replaced insulation in the basement but not yet dealt with the attic).\n\nMitsubishi heat pump air handler (SVZ-KP24NA) ‚Äî 24,000 BTU/hour\n\nGeneral Aire residential whole-house air cleaner (GFI #4422 or 4424)\n\nMitsubishi wall head (split-type air conditioner MSZ-GL15NA) ‚Äî one unit installed on second floor ‚Äî we considered a second but decided to save $$$\n\n\n\n50-gallon electric water heater ‚Äî the installer recommended against tankless despite what I‚Äôd read online ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\n18-panel / 5.04kW solar system (Itek IT280 photovoltaic modules and Itek Theia HE‚Äêt UL 3.8 kW inverter) ‚Äî installed in 2015\n\nThe air handler connects to our existing duct system. There‚Äôs the outdoor unit, which we placed on the side of the house directly below the upstairs heat pump head, and there‚Äôs also the air cleaner in the garage where the old furnace was.\n\nThe city bulk purchase program we went through offered Mitsubishi heat pumps, and we just went with what the contractor recommended.\n\nHow much did the heat pump and electric water heater cost?\n\nI am located in the Seattle area, which has been in a housing boom for a while so contractors are pretty expensive.\n\nThe heat pump cost $19,445 + 10.2% tax for equipment and installation. The permit cost $236.*\n\nThe electric water heater with new dedicated 220v circuit cost $2,145 + 10.2% tax.\n\nOur city provided a $500 incentive and coordinated a $1,200 discount for bulk purchase of equipment, so in total we paid $22,155 for both heat pump and new water heater.\n\n*The permit included an inspection, which failed the first time ‚Äî we wouldn‚Äôt have known what wasn‚Äôt installed quite right, so thanks inspector! He was super helpful and pointed out some other unrelated things he noticed that we might consider acting on.\n\nHeat pump vs. gas furnace energy use comparisons\n\nMy situation will not be directly comparable to most people‚Äôs because we have a solar array, but hopefully will still provide a relative comparison. I have provided the electricity we used, which includes power we generated and used directly, but not power we generated and sold back to PSE.\n\nUnfortunately since we upgraded the water heater at the same time, we can‚Äôt isolate only the cost of the heat pump ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nObnoxiously, our power bill comes mid-month. To make life easier for myself in the graphs, I‚Äôve represented the month the bill was issued. That typically covers usage from the 18th of the previous month through the 17th of the billing month üòï\n\nContext: weather and energy trends in the Pacific Northwest\n\nFor usage context, in the Seattle area, it‚Äôs relatively cool (and we run heating) from mid September through early June. Summer is usually relatively moderate, typically peaking with one or two weeks in the 90s (F). Over 100F is unusual.\n\nHow much more electricity did the heat pump use?\n\nThese data represent solely our electricity use, so you can guesstimate how much electricity we use for heating (and cooling) by how much our electricity increased after January 2023. During the cold months (December through March bills), we used about 1200-1500 additional kWh (for heating our space and water). Over the whole year, we used an additional 7300kWh compared to the previous year. (According to PSE, it‚Äôs typical to use about 2800kWh annually for an electric water heater and 6800kWh for a heat pump, or 9600kWh annually.)\n\nYou‚Äôll see that we had a big jump in electricity use in January 2024 (technically mid December through mid January). This coincides with an extremely cold snap for Washington, with temperatures in the ~19 degree Fahrenheit range for about a week. We didn‚Äôt adjust our thermostat during that time period, but did run the heat pump head overnight as well as pulled out a small standalone electric space heater to help keep the house warmer during the day.\n\nMonthly kWh electricity used, Sept. 16 2021-Jan. 17, 2024 Month 2021 2022 2023 2024 kWh difference\n\nwith heat pump 1 499 495 1946 1451 2 419 *1044 *625 3 545 1737 1192 4 681 1617 936 5 695 1120 425 6 531 993 462 7 1003 1213 210 8 1212 1059 -153 9 868 973 105 10 577 721 880 159 11 466 541 1274 733 12 430 500 1651 1151\n\nbold = electric only ‚Äî heat pump installed January 30, 2023\n\n* About half the February 2023 billing cycle was on gas heat\n\n\n\nHow much methane usage did we eliminate?\n\nIn 2022, we used 770 therms of methane.* Now, we use none! üôå\n\n*According to PSE, a typical house uses 690 therms for a gas furnace and 160 therms for a gas water heater, or 850 therms annually.\n\nComparing gas therms and kWh electricity\n\nA therm is equal to approximately 29 kWh. Unless I‚Äôm being totally unreasonable in converting and combining these values, here‚Äôs how the overall kWh shakes out ‚Äî a massive reduction in energy used with the heat pump (Feb 2023-Jan 2024):\n\nHow much did it cost to run the heat pump versus the gas furnace?\n\nThe first month we used the heat pump for cooling, I was braced for a radical energy bill, but thanks to our solar panels, we continued to pay the minimum electrical charge in summer ü¶æ\n\nIn actual costs, we paid $1435 for energy (gas and electricity) in 2022 and $1158 in 2023 (heat pump only); if we assumed that the four summer months of 2022 were $7.95 as in a normal year, that would still put 2022 at $1215. And if we swapped in this year‚Äôs all-electric January bill for last year‚Äôs gas-heated bill, that‚Äôs basically a wash. And now we have whole-house cooling in summer üòé\n\nMonthly energy bill by year, Sept. 16 2021-Jan. 17, 2024 Month 2021 2022 2023 2024 1 $218.41 *$229.79 $260.96 2 $158.67 $202.26 3 $148.30 $188.41 4 $108.26 $91.73 5 $79.85 $28.09 6 $51.67 $7.95 7 *$36.18 $7.95 8 *$76.16 $7.95 9 *$86.90 $7.95 10 $71.32 *$84.62 $46.02 11 $101.87 *$161.19 $136.05 12 $143.28 *$224.62 $204.68\n\nbold = electric only ‚Äî heat pump installed January 30, 2023\n\n* = our solar inverter was not selling electricity back to PSE these months, though was generating power for pass-through usage ‚Äî in a normal year the summer month costs would be the minimum $7.95 ‚Äî this also means there was no bank to draw from for those fall and winter months\n\nWhat I wish we‚Äôd known before switching to a heat pump\n\nIt heats differently than a gas furnace: slow and steady versus bursts of heat\n\nThe first month we had our heat pump, in the cold of February 2023, I was convinced it was broken or we‚Äôd been sold too small of a unit. If you go in with expectations that it‚Äôs going to be a different heating experience than a gas furnace, you‚Äôll be happier than I was at first üòâ\n\nBeing used to a gas furnace, we were used to saying, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cold!‚Äù and bumping the thermostat* up a couple degrees, then getting the immediate feedback of a big blast of hot air and a relatively quick increase in temperature.\n\nIn contrast, the heat pump blows air lightly all day long**. If we increase the thermostat setting, it will take several hours to reach the new temperature. Likewise, when it‚Äôs too cold out, sometimes it has a hard time keeping up. (I‚Äôm hoping that upping our attic insulation will help hold the temperature better.)\n\n*We had a Nest before, but I don‚Äôt think it actually helped save energy since we were home all day every day, so between that and Google‚Äôs creepy surveillance I was fine when I found out the heat pump came with a thermostat and wouldn‚Äôt work with the Nest. Unfortunately, the included thermostat is kind of annoying to program.\n\n**Because heat pumps blow constantly, the contractor recommended keeping as many vents open as possible ‚Äî closing no more than one or two. (There was a technical reason for this that I forget, something about making part of the heat pump get too cold and shut down.) Unfortunately, whoever installed our original HVAC system was, er, clearly the low bidder, so we have wacky vents directly underneath windows and doors all over the house ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è The register that blows the hottest is our downstairs bathroom üôÑ\n\nSo, with the heat pump, we don‚Äôt drop the temperature overnight as much as we did with the gas furnace. We keep the house a more consistent temperature all the time. Then, the poor heat pump isn‚Äôt always struggling to keep up, it just holds what it‚Äôs got.\n\nThe heads aren‚Äôt as quiet as they‚Äôre made out to be\n\nWhoever says they‚Äôre basically silent hasn‚Äôt paid much attention. The heat pump head (which is in our bedroom) makes mysterious noises pretty often, particularly when in heating mode*. My poor cat Mina stares at it, transfixed in horror, as it tinkles like broken glass going through the wash, whooshes like the house is blasting off, brrrs to life unexpectedly, and whirs as the louvers rotate up and down randomly. It sometimes makes noise even when the unit is turned off, which is confusing.\n\nThe fan noises are relatively quiet, especially in comparison with a window AC unit, so that‚Äôs probably the frame of reference people have when they talk about it being silent. But it‚Äôs not silent if you‚Äôre changing from forced air, which actually is basically silent üòâ Overall, it‚Äôs not too intrusive and totally worth it for being able to fine-tune the comfort level of our bedroom, but not quite what I had anticipated.\n\n*I am pretty sensitive to noise, but my husband and cats agree on this one üòâ\n\nOur verdict: the heat pump is a huge win for summer, good for winter\n\nIt kicks ass in summer\n\nWow, after previously not having cooling in summer, it was incredible to be able to comfortably use my office after like 3pm in the summer üòÇ I was especially the beneficiary because in the past my husband got the portable A/C unit since his office was hotter.\n\nThe heat pump couldn‚Äôt keep up with the hottest days in the high nineties, but even then still kept the house in comfortable mid to high eighties ‚Äî totally fine for us, especially with a ceiling fan.\n\nGood in normal cold, fine in cold cold\n\nOnce we learned how to program the thermostat appropriately, we‚Äôve been happy with how the heat pump keeps the house warm.\n\nI‚Äôll be honest: this thing struggles with the cold cold (below freezing). From my understanding, actually cold places use a backup furnace IIRC, but the temperature‚Äôs generally moderate enough in Seattle that we get by with just a heat pump and suck it up for the one or two extra-cold weeks a year.\n\nDuring our recent cold snap, when it was 16 degrees Fahrenheit overnight one night, the house was 55 degrees when we went downstairs in the morning despite the thermostat being set to 68. It didn‚Äôt heat up much during the morning, so we pulled out our little electric space heater and an electric heating pad to boost the warmth, and bundled up with down vests and blankets. This is where the heat pump head is key: we were able to keep our bedroom, where the head is located, comfortable overnight (though we did add extra blankets).\n\nAnd honestly? The heat pump‚Äôs so much more efficient, better for the climate, and safer for us that wearing a jacket for a week or two in the winter seems like a totally reasonable tradeoff.", "label": "personal"}

Outright fascism is worse, but there are plenty of things we need to change. Kat Abughazaleh, who‚Äôs running for office in Illinois, says:\n\n‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no reason every American should not be able to afford housing, groceries, health insurance, public transit (ideally), and then still have enough money to save and take your kid to the zoo or go to the movies with your friends. There‚Äôs just, there‚Äôs no reason ‚Äî we are the wealthiest country in the world. The idea that that‚Äôs unrealistic or idealistic or naive or even called childish, I think that‚Äôs sucky.‚Äù\n\nWe don‚Äôt have to settle for returning to a normal that sucks ‚Äî but protest may not be enough to force change. Our current situation has been the Republican gameplan for decades; we will not escape it by liberating ourselves from a single politician. Trump is a symptom, but the rot runs much deeper. We need to reckon emotionally with the long fights ahead; protests alone will not solve our problems. I‚Äôm not saying protest isn‚Äôt helpful or important ‚Äî I‚Äôm saying that we need to find space for both brunch and advocacy in our lives. Micah L. Sifry writes:\n\nOne of the most inspiring ways that pro-democracy movements grow their strength is by inventing and spreading ways for the silent majority to make itself both visible and influential.\n\nI‚Äôve been seeing organizers talking about the need to transform the current energy into long-term work, and not let it fizzle out. Jared Yates Sexton describes the way that authorities rein in public speech:\n\nWe are, according to those who want nothing more than to maintain control, supposed to protest enough, but not too much. Because we should rely on them. Because we need to maintain our subservient position under the party as opposed to in conversation and discourse with the party.\n\nOne strategy: focusing on local advocacy and building up\n\nMy pet theory is that most people should spend their advocacy time supporting local (and state) efforts, and donate to organizations advocating at the federal level. The collapse of local news and intense media focus on national politics encourages people to feel powerless because at the federal level most of what you can do is harass your senator. It also frames politics as something ‚Äúyou do‚Äù once every four years for normies, every two years for the passionate, every election for the wonks and zealots. If you get people involved in local politics, I imagine that get-out-the-vote drives become a lot easier because people are already tuned in.\n\nThe local level is more influential than people realize, I suspect. In Washington State, how environmental policies often play out is that they get implemented at either King County or City of Seattle first, then several suburban cities, and then there‚Äôs a model and coalition for building a state-level policy. As former city staff, I can say it‚Äôs no accident it works this way ‚Äî we knew our colleagues at other cities and would learn from each other, sharing lessons and draft policy language. Regional organizations support, both partnering with cities and going down to Olympia during the legislative session to advocate for (and against) bills. We know that Republicans followed a similar model in the evil direction in red states, building up a portfolio of harmful policies to bring to the federal level in the form of Project 2025‚Ä¶ why don‚Äôt we do the same for progressive policies?\n\nIf we start thinking and working now, we can set things up for the next state legislative session, then the next federal election, then the presidential election. (I‚Äôm not going down rabbitholes about martial law, I don‚Äôt find it helpful to indulge in that kind of despairing fatalism ‚Äî I think my personal work on managing catastrophic thinking and anxiety has paid dividends here.)\n\nI haven‚Äôt decided what bigger thing I want to work on yet‚Ä¶ for now I‚Äôve just been doing ad hoc advocacy when it‚Äôs pointed out by the urbanist Discord server I‚Äôm in. I‚Äôm pissed that Washington had a school lunch bill that failed in the legislative session, so potentially supporting another run at that‚Ä¶ or badgering the governor about Washington‚Äôs regressive taxation policy and demanding an income tax on the wealthiest Washingtonians, which he put the kibosh on this budget cycle and was why the budget was too tight to feed kids üôÑ Come on, Bob! We have a lot of tech companies ‚Äî and tech CEOs ‚Äî here who could stand to pay their fair share. Or I could go harder on supporting housing; I just looked at King County‚Äôs affordable housing dashboard, which identifies a need for 44,000 affordable units by 2024, and THE ENTIRE SEATTLE AREA HAD BUILT FEWER THAN FIVE THOUSAND UNITS by 2022. *screaming*\n\nOrganizing coalitions\n\nI‚Äôm also spinning on the provocation of the second method of organizing described in the Win the Midwest‚Äôs 10-year report (emphasis mine):\n\nThere are two approaches to base building. We can ask what we are for, and then go out and find the people who agree with us. Or we can begin by asking who we need to organize in order to build enough power to shift everything, and then go where they are: workplaces, churches, mosques, synagogues, schools, and childcare centers. Grassroots organizations that meet people where they are ‚Äì physically and ideologically ‚Äì and that create spaces of belonging, learning, and formation rooted in people‚Äôs lives and experiences have an unlimited number of people to organize. Most people do not have clearly defined political outlooks, but they can move into public leadership roles. Organizations willing to put their base at the center of their plans can co-create a political agenda that emerges from the lived experience of their bases.\n\nI‚Äôm an extremely opinionated person, and I know what outcomes I want (though I‚Äôd rather listen to others on the best tactics on achieving those outcomes), but maybe I could think of this as prioritizing which outcomes to focus on based on which ones enough other people also want and will fight for. L.A. Kauffman discusses building coalitions with those we disagree with, quoting a 1981 talk / 1983 essay ‚ÄúCoalition Politics: Turning the Century‚Äù:\n\n‚ÄúThe reason we are stumbling,‚Äù Dr. [Bernice] Reagon declared all those years ago, ‚Äúis that we are at the point where in order to take the next step we‚Äôve got to do it with some folk we don‚Äôt care too much about.

A former seminary student who was obsessed with ancient Greece, he started each practice with a philosophy discussion. He wove in, too, tales of past runners and triumphs ‚Äî he‚Äôd been coach for nearly thirty years already ‚Äî creating our own pantheon of heroes, the team‚Äôs own mythos. Who of us would one day join its ranks?\n\nMr. Taylor recognized how much the mind and body are connected. He treated our labor seriously, and expected us to do the same. Excellence ‚Äî ar√™te ‚Äî was our goal. I‚Äôll admit that plenty of times I tuned out the talk, but there was something about sitting down as a team to transition from school to sport, using that time to mentally prepare for the physical work.\n\nOne of my favorite rituals was to honor outgoing seniors on the cross-country team. At the final home race of the season, each senior released one of his homing pigeons. (I was annoyed because I had to share a pigeon üòÇ) As far as I can remember, there was no special meaning to this, it just was a thing that he made happen each year. A created ceremony we nonetheless looked forward to; simply having some marker, however arbitrary, gave the season an emotional culmination beyond the final race, recognition of our contributions to the team regardless of how we placed.\n\nHe built the team‚Äôs culture through these shared rites and rituals, building a sense of continuity with past runners both at our school and at the origins of track in Ancient Greece.\n\nI can‚Äôt talk about ritual and Mr. Taylor without also talking about Ar√™te West. Starting in 1979, every other year he took a group of about eight students from the track or cross country team to Greece. At first, they went to compete, but over the years it shifted into more of a philosophical journey and extended into greater Europe. Over the course of twenty trips, the experience developed its own rituals. (I went on trip thirteen.)\n\nThe first: secret invitation. My best friend hounded me, but I wouldn‚Äôt confess that I‚Äôd received The Postcard telling me when and where our first meeting would be. (We met every other week throughout the school year to study and prepare for the trip.) We all showed up that first night unsure who the seven other voyagers would be. In my year, the eighth person no-showed ‚Äî we never found out who else had been invited and declined to join.\n\nThe trip itself teemed with rituals. My least favorite involved running through the hot, dusty Greek countryside to an ancient track where we were expected to take off our shoes and run a lap in bare feet, like the runners of old. On Ithaca, we ran, separately, to ‚ÄúTelemachos‚Äô beach‚Äù. In Delphi, we were meant to sleep in ‚Äúthe meadow‚Äù where many past Arete trips had slept (but he couldn‚Äôt find it in the twilight, so we slept on a random dirt road üòí Apparently on my sister‚Äôs trip there was a dead dog in the meadow and they said no fucking way).\n\nMr. Taylor believed strongly in the power of place and designed the experience to provoke encounters with meaning. (Some more successful than others‚Ä¶) I lugged my clarinet across Europe so I could play Mozart‚Äôs clarinet concerto outside the building where he died (?). Everywhere we went, one or another of us had been assigned topics to present on or locations to give a reading. (I botched my reading from The Agony and The Ecstasy at the Vatican and read a passage about the wrong Michaelangelo Mother and Child sculpture ü§£) Overlooking the Acropolis, one of the boys had to read us Pericles‚Äôs funeral speech, as each trip had done before us. In Sils Maria, we walked in Nietzsche‚Äôs footsteps and discussed quotes at various waypoints along the trail. Our trip was our own, yet inextricably linked with previous trips through shared touchstones and repeated experiences: rituals meant to connect us to the past, both modern and ancient.\n\nThis is my contribution to the August IndieWeb Blog Carnival, hosted by Steve Ledlow on the theme of ritual.", "label": "personal"}

I used to use another brand of gel pens where you could replace the ink rather than having to dispose of the whole thing when it runs out, which would be a plus.\n\nThe stuff I write down may end up being typed up and stored in a digital system, but about 80% of the time, what I write starts on paper.\n\nThose with an optimizing mindset might find it a bit strange to duplicate effort in this way. Write stuff by hand and then type it into a digital system? Why?\n\nFor me, writing notes and ideas by hand is an important first stage. There are fewer distractions in a notebook. If you write digitally, you go immediately into editing mode - rewriting words, cutting and pasting, chopping and changing. Sometimes that‚Äôs important, but there‚Äôs an advantage to just letting the thoughts sit around for a bit before getting the scalpel out.\n\n‚ÄúSure, but what about an iPad with a Apple Pencil? Or a reMarkable? Or just scanning your notebook and using handwriting recognition?‚Äù asks a conveniently invented interlocuter.\n\nIf those work for you, great. I have tried taking notes on an iPad with a stylus, and it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ fine. I was curious about the reMarkable, but then they added bloody subscription fees. I already have a notebook and a pen. Spending hundreds of pounds on another gadget, plus having to deal with tech nonsense like susbcription fees, and USB chargers - and, for what? I already have a notebook. It‚Äôs good.\n\nThe second second stage of typing it up into a digital system isn‚Äôt a problem that needs solving, it‚Äôs a purposeful decision. The typing up stage is where I add context, reorder and restructure the ideas to make them more coherent, work out what needs to happen with the information‚Äîsee how things hang together in the broadest possible sense of the term, that kinda thing. Often times, the typing up stage will involve digging out links, finding references, double-checking stuff.\n\nSeparating thinking and writing into separate stages works for me. It takes time, but if the end result is better ideas or clearer understanding, that‚Äôs time well spent.\n\nMinimally cursed technology\n\nIn terms of how I pick digital tools, I‚Äôm not an free/open source purist, but my starting point is I want stable forever software, free of corporate control, that uses formats that are open, widely-implemented and simple. If it is open source, all the better. If it isn‚Äôt, I treat it as considerably more disposable than I do free software.\n\nThere‚Äôs commercial software I use which is pay once, or where there‚Äôs an ‚Äúannual pass‚Äù type approach that unlocks new features. I avoid SaaS and subscriptionware, not because of the cost, but because of the control. I don‚Äôt trust stuff to not go away.\n\nThere are morally disgusting elements in the software industry‚ÄîAdobe just referred to Creative Cloud users as heroin addicts, and I want no part of that. But there is an incredibly pragmatic, commercial argument for preferring software that‚Äôs open source (or at least closer to the Platonic ideal): it seems incredibly risky to hand over control of the tools one relies on to work effectively to companies whose commercial incentives do not necessarily align with your own. They can screw you over at any time, and you‚Äôve got no practical recourse. This is true of everybody whose job involves using technology, which, these days, is practically everyone. It‚Äôs true of knowledge workers‚Äîscientists, designers, software developers, lawyers, civil servants, journalists‚Äîhaving control over the tools of their work, but it is also just as true of rural farmers being able to repair their tractors or doctors being able to fix ventilators during a global pandemic (they ended up getting more help from a Polish hacker than from the medical device manufacturers).\n\nOn open data, the near guaranteed way to achieve this is plain text. That‚Äôs it. The closer to plain text it is, the better.\n\nI‚Äôve worked in companies where our beautifully curated bug tracker‚Äîwhich, along with the commit history, is the closest thing to an oral history of a software project‚Äîdisappeared because someone decides that they prefer a different system. God only knows why‚Äî it‚Äôs 40¬¢ per user per month cheaper, the sales guy took them for a nice lunch, the icon is a nicer shade of blue. Nobody transferred the data. All the links to the bugs are broken. The consequence? The developers have no idea what happened before last week because it‚Äôs all disappeared. If it‚Äôs not in text/plain or something close to it (Markdown, HTML, etc.), it dies. If it is in plain text or something close to it, you can version control it, which is handy.\n\nI cannot emphasise enough how important plain text is. It‚Äôs unreasonably effective, one might say. The fact that in knowledge-based workplaces and professions, only programmers seem to grasp the significance of this is incredibly strange.\n\nImplementation\n\nIn terms of electronic tooling, my first ports of call for writing are Emacs and Obsidian. Emacs is mostly for code, Obsidian is mostly for prose, but there‚Äôs some overlap.\n\nFor Emacs, I use the Doom distro. I used Vim for a long time, and evil-mode gives me Vim but I can customise it more to my needs. In practice, I don‚Äôt customise very much, but Emacs Lisp is preferable to Vimscript. And my Emacs setup looks pretty.\n\nWhen it comes to programming, my go-to languages these days are Python and Rust (plus, I guess, Elisp).\n\nAs for Obsidian, it‚Äôs where pretty much everything that‚Äôs not code and is of longer term importance ends up. It‚Äôs a personal wiki, basically. Some people like to call them ‚Äúzettelkastens‚Äù or ‚Äúpersonal knowledge management systems‚Äù but I just say ‚Äúpersonal wiki‚Äù. Everything goes in there - notes on interesting things I read, hard-fought lessons, lists of films and music to try.\n\nIt is a genuine extended mind though. The main benefit is thought not going to waste. I‚Äôve been in discussions with people, and we‚Äôve been trying to understand something - I can pull up information from my personal wiki and refresh myself on what did I think when I encountered this thing in the past, and why.\n\nI don‚Äôt love Obsidian (it not being open source being one problem). Logseq is promising (and actually open source), but I‚Äôve been too busy to switch over. I‚Äôve tried org-mode and I like it, but Org mode keybindings are weird and I‚Äôm too lazy to change them. Plus there isn‚Äôt really good mobile tooling in Org-mode world.\n\nBoth Obsidian and Logseq are just plain text which I trust far more than whatever rat-infested proprietary crap is popular until it gets sunsetted or pivoted or screwed up.\n\nIn theory, how you sync Obsidian (and Logseq) is up to you. In practice, if you‚Äôre on macOS/iOS, you‚Äôve got a couple of options:\n\niCloud Drive - it‚Äôs built into the OS after all\n\nDropbox / Google Drive / whatever - I‚Äôve moved away from them\n\nsome self-hosted thing - Resilio Sync, Syncthing, WebDAV etc.\n\nObsidian‚Äôs paid for sync service which is probably lovely but it is $20 a month, no thanks\n\nGit - it‚Äôs plain text, version control it\n\nThe latter is great but fiddly if you want to sync between iOS and desktop. This tutorial explains exactly how to do it correctly with Working Copy. Doing it any other way is a recipe for pain and unpleasantness.\n\n(The other way to do it is to have a Git copy, and then some kind of way to sync it to a cloud storage system without the Git repo, then pull the changes back in. Essentially that‚Äôs what the Working Copy/Shortcuts trick is doing on iOS.)\n\nI‚Äôve bounced back and forth between Apple Notes and Bear for more trivial, throw-away stuff. Ultimately, that is for short-lived stuff - the important stuff gets checked into the personal wiki, because text/plain wins.\n\nIn terms of this blog, it uses Hugo. Why? Dunno. It‚Äôs alright. I chose it because it‚Äôs a single binary, and I had previously gotten utterly bored of RubyGems and Python virtualenvs and all that dependency management stuff. There‚Äôs stuff I don‚Äôt like about it, but I don‚Äôt really have time to fix all the issues now.\n\nGo make stuff\n\nWriting and reading about tools is fun, but it is a whole lot of empty calories.\n\nPick the least bad option, try to exercise control over your tools rather than cede it to unpleasant people who want to turn everything on your computer into a satellite TV subscription, with you as a disempowered consumer.\n\nUse the tools you‚Äôve settled on to do things you value: learning stuff, writing, make art, watch cat videos, and your job (optional). That is all.", "label": "personal"}
{"title": "Testing the Firefox alternatives", "url": "https://tommorris.org/posts/2024/testing-the-firefox-alternatives/", "content": "Firefox and Mozilla are in a bit of a state. Firefox and Mozilla are always in a bit of a state, but the recent release of Firefox 130 which includes an AI chatbot feature has prompted a lot of head scratching.\n\nYes, I get that some people want it, and you can turn it off. And, no, that is not the issue. The issue is Mozilla are spending a lot of time and effort on chasing the sort of silly AI hype that gets Tony Blair excited. That‚Äôs rather disconcerting if you‚Äôd like Mozilla to focus on making a good browser instead of chasing the new and shiny because it is new and shiny.\n\n(In their defence: I‚Äôll note that some of the AI stuff Mozilla is pursing is reasonable. The translation feature uses a local model for translation, which is a great idea. It doesn‚Äôt support all the languages that Google Translate does, but it‚Äôs good. )\n\nAnyway, the rot just goes on. In July, it was the rollout of privacy-preserving attribution (having previously purchased Anonym). Before that, it was the rollout of the ghastly Proton UI, which necessitated (and still necessitates) setting up Lepton aka Firefox-UI-Fix. There‚Äôs plenty more things people are grumpy about‚Äîabandoning Servo, Solo (yet more AI hype), Pocket‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs so many things, one begins to lose track.\n\nYou can totally still stick with Firefox‚Ä¶ but remember to download userChrome.css from GitHub. And if you want vertical tabs, be sure to install Sidebery until Mozilla get around to implementing native vertical tabs. (You know, like Chromium-based browsers including Edge and Vivaldi already have.)\n\nAnd then turn off a bunch of settings and install a bunch of extensions to tighten up privacy.\n\nAnd then brace yourself for Mozilla to find new and exciting ways to disappoint you every six weeks with some new brand of nonsensical bullshit.\n\nWhen the Privacy Preserving Ads stuff was rolled out, I pulled the trigger and switched to LibreWolf. The AI chat stuff has prompted a lot of people to look for Firefox but with less Mozilla nonsense.\n\nSwitching to what are essentially ‚ÄúFirefox distros‚Äù to collectively try and nudge Mozilla back to making more sensible decisions instead of AI hype chasing is an eminently reasonable one. There‚Äôs more reasons than just that. Part of the reason I use Firefox-based browsers rather than Chromium browsers is because I want to preserve some choice and diversity in browser engines. The existence of a choice of different Firefox derived browsers may allow space for experimentation in designing better browsers. In Chromium land, Arc has shown that there‚Äôs an opportunity for quite radically rethinking how browsers work. Same for Orion in Mac/iOS-land.\n\nThis isn‚Äôt a detailed review of the different browsers, just a few comments and observations having tried them.\n\nLibreWolf\n\nLibreWolf has been my daily driver for a few months now. It‚Äôs very close to Firefox, but with a bunch of privacy-focussed defaults.\n\nSome of these are straightforward: uBlock Origin is pre-installed, for instance. Google is not set as a default search engine‚ÄîDuckDuckGo, Qwant, Mojeek, and a public SearXNG instance are. HTTPS only is on by default. There‚Äôs no sponsored content on the home page, and there‚Äôs no telemetry.\n\nLibreWolf‚Äôs commitment to good privacy defaults is simultaneously a feature and a problem. The ‚Äúresist fingerprinting‚Äù (RFP) settings which are pulled in from the Tor Browser actively make using certain websites impossible. They trigger some kind of anti-abuse mechanisms on said websites which then require that I complete a CAPTCHA, and there is only so much of my life I wish to spend clicking squares containing fire hydrants, ‚Äúcrosswalks‚Äù, or yellow New York taxis or various other bits of American street furniture. If it were just on crappy websites, I wouldn‚Äôt mind but the main place I encounter this is actually JSTOR, along with a number of other academic/research databases. Hindering access to the few websites where the content is written by subject matter experts rather than AI-generated marketing slop is inconvenient enough that I turned RFP off via a trip to about:config .\n\nWhat I‚Äôd really like is if RFP could be turned off on a per-site basis. Or if one could use the containers feature in Firefox (perhaps with Multi-Account Containers) to have RFP running on most sites, with special treatment for the websites that don‚Äôt like it.\n\nSimilarly, not storing history is a great privacy choice. It‚Äôs also an incredibly annoying choice for the average user who would quite like to be able to find that blog post they spent hours searching for again in their browser‚Äôs history section. And, yes, you can turn it off.\n\nIf you are the sort of person who has a YubiKey, has attended a GPG key signing party, or has opinions about elliptic curve cryptography, LibreWolf may be a great fit for your tastes. If you‚Äôre not, beware that security and usability are destined to have a rocky relationship‚Äîand you may have to go fumbling around to disable certain security features if certain websites get aggrieved at the hardened privacy choices in LibreWolf.\n\nFloorp\n\nFloorp is a Firefox-based browser built by Ablaze, ‚Äúa group of creators primarily active in Japan. It is a community and not a company or a public organization‚Äù (according to their FAQ).\n\nWhen you start, you can choose a ‚Äútemplate‚Äù. The UI doesn‚Äôt really tell you what the templates are, but if you push the buttons, it‚Äôll show you.\n\nThe ‚Äúdefault‚Äù options gives you an Vivaldi/Edge style sidebar containing icons that open up sidebar tabs for bookmarks, history and a ‚Äònotes‚Äô feature, plus links to documentation, Google Translate (I‚Äôm home the Firefox local translation will come at some point), and passwords, settings and extensions. In addition, there‚Äôs a sidebar panel called the ‚Äúbrowser manager‚Äù which is history, downloads, tags and bookmarks rolled into one. It has a menu bar at the top. Presumably, on Windows and Linux, this is the primary way to access the menu bar, but this is probably a bug that needs fixing on the Mac version.\n\nThe ‚Äúbasic‚Äù template disables this sidebar. The ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù template enables a status bar that contains a ‚Äúfull screen‚Äù button and a ‚Äútake a screenshot‚Äù button, and not much else, though you can obviously put stuff on there. The ‚Äúdefault‚Äù option is fine. You can remove items from the sidebar, but annoyingly. It‚Äôd be nice if you could move extension icons there, but that‚Äôs a limitation of Firefox.\n\nIn addition, Floorp allows you to choose from a variety of different Firefox UI designs including both Proton and Photon/Lepton. It has built-in vertical tabs, without the fuss (but also without the features) of Sidebery. If you‚Äôre intending to use vertical tabs, the Proton UI actually fits in aesthetically in both light and dark themes in a way it doesn‚Äôt in Firefox.\n\nThe sensible privacy defaults of LibreWolf aren‚Äôt there, so you‚Äôll probably want to install uBlock Origin, change from Google to a search engine that doesn‚Äôt use text regurgitation software to advise users to ‚Äúenjoy the crunchy texture of glass without worrying about it contributing to weight gain‚Äù, relax in a bath with a toaster and all the other stuff to turn the web from an absolute wreck into almost usable.\n\nOne feature I do like a lot in both Floorp and Zen: workspaces. These are very similar to both Arc‚Äôs profiles and spaces features, and ‚Äútab groups‚Äù in Safari and Orion, and are handy for separating out personal and work-related tabs, or dealing with the general irritation caused by having multiple logins for different Single Sign On (another tech industry lie).\n\nDetails on the website are a bit sparse, and quite a lot of the Japanese documentation hasn‚Äôt been translated into English. It‚Äôs decent though, and offers lots of customisability.\n\nZen\n\nZen is relatively new. The design is clearly very inspired by Arc (rounded corners galore). Vertical tabs by default (plans are afoot to add boring old-style tabs).\n\nThere‚Äôs lots to say about the layout. There‚Äôs a compact mode which makes everything slide away.\n\nLike Floorp, there‚Äôs a sidebar feature. Given the tab bar is a sidebar, to distinguish it from the tab bar, the settings refer to it as ‚ÄúWeb Side Panels‚Äù‚Äîwhile the UI calls it the ‚ÄúZen Sidebar‚Äù. It‚Äôs like a browser-in-a-browser. It comes preloaded with links for Wikipedia, Twitter/X, YouTube, Google Translate and Todoist. I can see the use cases for all of them: quickly looking stuff up on the side in Wikipedia, tweeting (excreting?), watching videos, translating snippets of text, and marking off items on your to-do list‚Ä¶ but there doesn‚Äôt seem to be the kind of coherence there as there is with using the sidebar to put browser features like bookmarks, history etc. I disabled the Web Side Panels/Zen Sidebar it in the settings as I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll use it.\n\nSomewhat confusingly, in Keyboard Shortcuts, I can set shortcuts to open history and bookmarks in a traditional Firefox-style sidebar. And I can open these from the View menu. In the tab sidebar, there are buttons for opening the history and bookmarks. The bookmarks button opens the bookmarks in a sidebar, while the history opens up the equivalent of the recently closed tabs section.\n\nIf you really like sidebars, you could have a sidebar with your tabs, then click ‚Äòbookmarks‚Äô to open a bookmarks sidebar, then have a ‚ÄúZen Sidebar‚Äù (aka a Web Side Panel). But you probably shouldn‚Äôt.\n\nOne small nitpick I did find‚Äîthe icons for opening the bookmarks and history or sliding the tab sidebar over don‚Äôt have tooltips. The settings button has a tooltip which reads ‚ÄúOpen settings ({$shortcut})‚Äù which presumably should contain a keyboard shortcut.\n\nOn macOS, another weird part‚Äîif you use a tab sidebar, the red/yellow/green buttons are no longer in the corner‚Äîthey‚Äôre immediately above the content area. This looks a bit odd. It‚Äôs probably remediable by having the tab bar on the right‚Ä¶ but the checkbox to move it to the right doesn‚Äôt work for me. You can fix it by switching on ‚ÄúUse legacy toolbar position‚Äù, or by enabling the title bar in the toolbar customisation menu.\n\nOne other slight annoyance: when I tried to log on to a site supporting Passkeys, it stated ‚ÄúThis browser or device is reporting partial passkey support.‚Äù\n\nThe above complaints may sound like I dislike Zen‚ÄîI very much don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs described as ‚Äúalpha‚Äù on their website and release notes, and it‚Äôs remarkably good given the first alpha release came out less than two months ago, so this kind of UI nitpicks will almost certainly go away given how much progress they‚Äôre making in a very short time.\n\nThey‚Äôve made a theme store to collect themes specifically for Zen, which is helpful given the significant distance it has travelled from stock Firefox in terms of UI design.\n\nLike Floorp, there‚Äôs workspaces, which are very handy and integrate with containers. Also like Floop (but unlike LibreWolf out-of-the-box), you can use Firefox Sync.\n\nThe default search engine is DuckDuckGo, which is an improvement on Google. There‚Äôs also Google, (English) Wikipedia and eBay.\n\nAgain, the privacy defaults are pretty much like Firefox‚Äôs, so you‚Äôll want to install uBlock Origin and any other privacy-related add-ons that you would in Firefox.\n\nOnwards\n\nThere are a bunch of other Firefox-derived browsers like Waterfox, Pale Moon, Basilisk, IceCat. I haven‚Äôt tried them, and don‚Äôt know much about them.\n\nOne important thing to keep an eye on how quickly security fixes get pushed through from upstream Firefox to Firefox-derived browsers. For a long time, I stuck with Firefox precisely because of this. It‚Äôs a sign of how bad the rot has got at Mozilla that people are so keen on alternatives. I really hope Mozilla might learn something from this, but history suggests they‚Äôll try literally anything else first, and the love-hate relationship will never end.", "label": "personal"}

{"title": "IssueOps: Automate CI/CD (and more!) with GitHub Issues and Actions", "url": "https://github.blog/engineering/issueops-automate-ci-cd-and-more-with-github-issues-and-actions/", "content": "Software development is filled with repetitive tasks‚Äîmanaging issues, handling approvals, triggering CI/CD workflows, and more. But what if you could automate these types of tasks directly within GitHub Issues? That‚Äôs the promise of IssueOps, a methodology that turns GitHub Issues into a command center for automation.\n\nWhether you‚Äôre a solo developer or part of an engineering team, IssueOps helps you streamline operations without ever leaving your repository.\n\nIn this article, I‚Äôll explore the concept of IssueOps using state-machine terminology and strategies to help you work more efficiently on GitHub. After all, who doesn‚Äôt love automation?\n\nWhat is IssueOps?\n\nIssueOps is the practice of using GitHub Issues, GitHub Actions, and pull requests (PR) as an interface for automating workflows. Instead of switching between tools or manually triggering actions, you can use issue comments, labels, and state changes to kick off CI/CD pipelines, assign tasks, and even deploy applications.\n\nMuch like the various other *Ops paradigms (ChatOps, ClickOps, and so on), IssueOps is a collection of tools, workflows, and concepts that, when applied to GitHub Issues, can automate mundane, repetitive tasks. The flexibility and power of issues, along with their relationship to pull requests, create a near limitless number of possibilities, such as managing approvals and deployments. All of this can really help to simplify your workflows on GitHub. I‚Äôm speaking from personal experience here.\n\nIt‚Äôs important to note that IssueOps isn‚Äôt just a DevOps thing! Where DevOps offers a methodology to bring developers and operations into closer alignment, IssueOps is a workflow automation practice centered around GitHub Issues. IssueOps lets you run anything from complex CI/CD pipelines to a bed and breakfast reservation system. If you can interact with it via an API, there‚Äôs a good chance you can build it with IssueOps!\n\nSo, why use IssueOps?\n\nThere are lots of benefits to utilizing IssueOps. Here‚Äôs how it‚Äôs useful in practice:\n\nIt‚Äôs event driven, so you can automate the boring stuff: IssueOps lets you automate workflows directly from GitHub Issues and pull requests, turning everyday interactions‚Äîfrom kicking off a CI/CD pipeline and managing approvals to updating project boards‚Äîinto powerful triggers for GitHub Actions.\n\nIssueOps lets you automate workflows directly from GitHub Issues and pull requests, turning everyday interactions‚Äîfrom kicking off a CI/CD pipeline and managing approvals to updating project boards‚Äîinto powerful triggers for GitHub Actions. It‚Äôs customizable, so you can tailor workflows to your needs: No two teams work the same way, and IssueOps is flexible enough to adapt. Whether you‚Äôre automating bug triage or triggering deployments, you can customize workflows based on event type and data provided.\n\nIt‚Äôs transparent, so you can keep a record: All actions taken on an issue are logged in its timeline, creating an easy-to-follow record of what happened and when.\n\nIt‚Äôs immutable, so you can audit whenever you need: Because IssueOps uses GitHub Issues and pull requests as a source of truth, every action leaves a record. No more chasing approvals in Slack or manually triggering workflows: IssueOps keeps everything structured, automated, and auditable right inside GitHub.\n\nOur quickstart guide to IssueOps Step 1: Define your triggers\n\nIdentify the actions that should kick off your workflows‚Äîlike opening an issue, adding a label, or merging a pull request. These events can serve as triggers for GitHub Actions.\n\nIdentify the actions that should kick off your workflows‚Äîlike opening an issue, adding a label, or merging a pull request. These events can serve as triggers for GitHub Actions. Step 2: Configure GitHub Actions Use GitHub Actions to define what happens when an event occurs. For example, if an issue is labeled deploy, you could trigger a deployment script. YAML never looked so good.\n\nStep 3: Test and iterate Like any good automation, IssueOps workflows should be tested and refined. Start small, see what works, and expand from there. Let‚Äôs go: Learn more in our repository.\n\nDefining IssueOps workflows and how they‚Äôre like finite-state machines\n\nMost IssueOps workflows follow the same basic pattern:\n\nA user opens an issue and provides information about a request The issue is validated to ensure it contains the required information The issue is submitted for processing Approval is requested from an authorized user or team The request is processed and the issue is closed\n\nSuppose you‚Äôre an administrator of an organization and want to reduce the overhead of managing team members. In this instance, you could use IssueOps to build an automated membership request and approval process. Within a workflow like this, you‚Äôd have several core steps:\n\nA user creates a request to be added to a team The request is validated The request is submitted for approval An administrator approves or denies this request The request is processed If approved, the user is added to the team If denied, the user is not added to the team The user is notified of the outcome\n\nWhen designing your own IssueOps workflows, it can be very helpful to think of them as a finite-state machine: a model for how objects move through a series of states in response to external events. Depending on certain rules defined within the state machine, a number of different actions can take place in response to state changes. If this is a little too complex, you can also think of it like a flow chart.\n\nTo apply this comparison to IssueOps, an issue is the object that is processed by a state machine. It changes state in response to events. As the object changes state, certain actions may be performed as part of a transition, provided any required conditions (guards) are met. Once an end state is reached, the issue can be closed.\n\nThis breaks down into a few key concepts:\n\nState : A point in an object‚Äôs lifecycle that satisfies certain condition(s).\n\n: A point in an object‚Äôs lifecycle that satisfies certain condition(s). Event : An external occurrence that triggers a state change.\n\n: An external occurrence that triggers a state change. Transition : A link between two states that, when traversed by an object, will cause certain action(s) to be performed.\n\n: A link between two states that, when traversed by an object, will cause certain action(s) to be performed. Action : An atomic task that is performed when a transition is taken.\n\n: An atomic task that is performed when a transition is taken. Guard: A condition that is evaluated when a trigger event occurs. A transition is taken only if all associated guard condition(s) are met.\n\nHere‚Äôs a simple state diagram for the example I discussed above.\n\nNow, let‚Äôs dive into the state machine in more detail!\n\nKey concepts behind state machines\n\nThe benefit of breaking your workflow down into these components is that you can look for edge cases, enforce conditions, and create a robust, reliable result.\n\nStates\n\nWithin a state machine, a state defines the current status of an object. As the object transitions through the state machine, it will change states in response to external events. When building IssueOps workflows, common states for issues include opened, submitted, approved, denied, and closed.\n\nThese should suffice as the core states to consider when building our workflows in our team membership example above.\n\nEvents\n\nIn a state machine, an event can be any form of interaction with the object and its current state. When building your own IssueOps, you should consider events from both the user and GitHub points of view.\n\nIn our team membership request example, there are several events that can trigger a change in state. The request can be created, submitted, approved, denied, or processed.\n\nIn this example, a user interacting with an issue‚Äîsuch as adding labels, commenting, or updating milestones‚Äîcan also change its state. In GitHub Actions, there are many events that can trigger your workflows (see events that trigger workflows).\n\nHere are a few interactions, or events, that would affect our example IssueOps workflow when it comes to managing team members:\n\nRequest Event State Request is created issues opened Request is approved issue_comment created Request is denied issue_comment created\n\nAs you can see, the same GitHub workflow trigger can apply to multiple events in our state machine. Because of this, validation is key. Within your workflows, you should check both the type of event and the information provided by the user. In this case, we can conditionally trigger different workflow steps based on the content of the issue_comment event.\n\njobs: approve: name: Process Approval runs-on: ubuntu-latest if: ${{ startsWith(github.event.comment.body, '.approve') }} # ... deny: name: Process Denial runs-on: ubuntu-latest if: ${{ startsWith(github.event.comment.body, '.deny') }} # ...\n\nTransitions\n\nA transition is simply the change from one state to another. In our example, for instance, a transition occurs when someone opens an issue. When a request meets certain conditions, or guards, the change in state can take place. When the transition occurs, some actions or processing may take place, as well.\n\nWith our example workflow, you can think of the transitions themselves as the lines connecting different nodes in the state diagram. Or the lines connecting boxes in a flow chart.\n\nGuards\n\nGuards are conditions that must be verified before an event can trigger a transition to a different state. In our case, we know the following guards must be in place:\n\nA request should not transition to an Approved state unless an administrator comments .approve on the issue.\n\non the issue. A request should not transition to a Denied state unless an administrator comments .deny on the issue.\n\nWhat about after the request is approved and the user is added to the team? This is referred to as an unguarded transition. There are no conditions that must be met, so the transition happens immediately!\n\nActions\n\nLastly, actions are specific tasks that are performed during a transition. They may affect the object itself, but this is not a requirement in our state machine. In our example, the following actions may take place at different times:\n\nAdministrators are notified that a request has been submitted\n\nThe user is added to the requested team\n\nThe user is notified of the outcome\n\nA real-world example: Building a team membership workflow with IssueOps\n\nNow that all of the explanation is out of the way, let‚Äôs dive into building our example! For reference, we‚Äôll focus on the GitHub Actions workflows involved in building this automation. There are some additional repository and permissions settings involved that are discussed in more detail in these IssueOps docs.\n\nStep 1: Issue form template\n\nGitHub issue forms let you create standardized, formatted issues based on a set of form fields. Combined with the issue-ops/parser action, you can get reliable, machine-readable JSON from issue body Markdown. For our example, we are going to create a simple form that accepts a single input: the team where we want to add the user.\n\nname: Team Membership Request description: Submit a new membership request title: New Team Membership Request labels: - team-membership body: - type: input id: team attributes: label: Team Name description: The team name you would like to join placeholder: my-team validations: required: true\n\nWhen issues are created using this form, they will be parsed into JSON, which can then be passed to the rest of the IssueOps workflow.\n\n{ \"team\": \"my-team\" }\n\nStep 2: Issue validation\n\nWith a machine-readable issue body, we can run additional validation checks to ensure the information provided follows any rules we might have in place. For example, we can‚Äôt automatically add a user to a team if the team doesn‚Äôt exist yet! That is where the issue-ops/validator action comes into play. Using an issue form template and a custom validation script, we can confirm the existence of the team ahead of time.\n\nmodule.exports = async (field) => { const { Octokit } = require('@octokit/rest') const core = require('@actions/core') const github = new Octokit({ auth: core.getInput('github-token', { required: true }) }) try { // Check if the team exists core.info(`Checking if team '${field}' exists`) await github.rest.teams.getByName({ org: process.env.GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER ?? '', team_slug: field }) core.info(`Team '${field}' exists`) return 'success' } catch (error) { if (error.status === 404) { // If the team does not exist, return an error message core.error(`Team '${field}' does not exist`) return `Team '${field}' does not exist` } else { // Otherwise, something else went wrong... throw error } } }\n\nWhen included in our IssueOps workflow, this adds any validation error(s) to the comment on the issue.\n\nStep 3: Issue workflows\n\nThe main ‚Äúentrypoint‚Äù of this workflow occurs when a user creates or edits their team membership request issue. This workflow should focus heavily on validating any user inputs! For example, what should happen if the user inputs a team that does not exist?\n\nIn our state machine, this workflow is responsible for handling everything up to the opened state. Any time an issue is created, edited, or updated, it will re-run validation to ensure the request is ready to be processed. In this case, an additional guard condition is introduced. Before the request can be submitted, the user must comment with .submit after validation has passed.\n\nname: Process Issue Open/Edit on: issues: types: - opened - edited - reopened permissions: contents: read id-token: write issues: write jobs: validate: name: Validate Request runs-on: ubuntu-latest # This job should only be run on issues with the `team-membership` label. if: ${{ contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, 'team-membership') }} steps: # This is required to ensure the issue form template and any validation # scripts are included in the workspace. - name: Checkout id: checkout uses: actions/checkout@v4 # Since this workflow includes custom validation scripts, we need to # install Node.js and any dependencies. - name: Setup Node.js id: setup-node uses: actions/setup-node@v4 # Install dependencies from `package.json`. - name: Install Dependencies id: install run: npm install # GitHub App authentication is required if you want to interact with any # resources outside the scope of the repository this workflow runs in. - name: Get GitHub App Token id: token uses: actions/create-github-app-token@v1 with: app-id: ${{ vars.ISSUEOPS_APP_ID }} private-key: ${{ secrets.ISSUEOPS_APP_PRIVATE_KEY }} owner: ${{ github.repository_owner }} # Remove any labels and start fresh.

Your request has been validated successfully! Please comment with `.submit` to submit this request.\n\nOnce the issue is created, any further processing is triggered using issue comments‚Äîand this can be done with one workflow. However, to make things a bit easier to follow, we‚Äôll break this into a few separate workflows.\n\nSubmit workflow\n\nThe first workflow handles the user submitting the request. The main task it performs is validating the issue body against the form template to ensure it hasn‚Äôt been modified.\n\nname: Process Submit Comment on: issue_comment: types: - created permissions: contents: read id-token: write issues: write jobs: submit: name: Submit Request runs-on: ubuntu-latest # This job should only be run when the following conditions are true: # # - A user comments `.submit` on the issue. # - The issue has the `team-membership` label. # - The issue has the `validated` label. # - The issue does not have the `approved` or `denied` labels. # - The issue is open. if: | startsWith(github.event.comment.body, '.submit') && contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, 'team-membership') == true && contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, 'approved') == false && contains(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, 'denied') == false && github.event.issue.state == 'open' steps: # First, we are going to re-run validation.

With a handful of standardized workflows, you have an end-to-end, issue-driven process in place to manage team membership. This can be extended as far as you want, including support for removing users, auditing access, and more. With IssueOps, the sky is the limit!\n\nHere‚Äôs the best thing about IssueOps: It brings another level of automation to a surface I‚Äôm constantly using‚Äîand that‚Äôs GitHub. By using issues and pull requests as control centers for workflows, teams can reduce friction, improve efficiency, and keep everything transparent. Whether you want to automate deployments, approvals, or bug triage, IssueOps makes it all possible, without ever leaving your repo.\n\nFor more information and examples, check out the open source IssueOps documentation repository, and if you want a deeper dive, you can head over to the open source IssueOps documentation.\n\nIn my experience, it‚Äôs always best to start small and experiment with what works best for you. With just a bit of time, you‚Äôll see your workflows get smoother with every commit (I know I have). Happy coding! ‚ú®\n\nTags:", "label": "personal"}

So if you‚Äôre only using them to provide status updates, you‚Äôre leaving a lot on the table.\n\nI didn‚Äôt fully realize this potential until I mentioned in a one-on-one that I was interested in mentorship and growing my leadership skills. Not long after, I was asked to co-lead a project with an intern to build an internal tool that helped surface enterprise configuration details. This gave me the opportunity to take technical ownership on a project while mentoring someone in a real-world context‚Äîboth of which pushed me outside my comfort zone in the best way. That experience made it clear: When used intentionally, one-on-ones can open doors you didn‚Äôt even know were there.\n\nMany engineers treat one-on-ones as a low-stakes standup: reporting work, mentioning blockers, and getting general feedback. While that can be useful, it barely scratches the surface of what these meetings can accomplish. Instead, think of them as a system design review for your role‚Äîa time to debug challenges, optimize your workflow, and align on long-term career goals.\n\nReframing your perception of what a one-on-one can accomplish\n\nA well-structured one-on-one meeting with your manager isn‚Äôt just a check-in, it‚Äôs an opportunity to shape your work environment and career trajectory. You wouldn‚Äôt build a system without evaluating its constraints, dependencies, and long-term maintainability. Why approach your career any differently?\n\nStart by shifting your mindset: These meetings are not status updates. Your manager already sees your pull requests, sprint velocity, and planning docs. Instead, use this time to highlight what matters‚Äîwhat you‚Äôve shipped, the value it‚Äôs delivered, and where the friction is.\n\nYou can also use this space to validate decisions and gather context. If you‚Äôre weighing different paths forward, don‚Äôt just ask for approval‚Äîframe the conversation in terms of trade-offs:\n\n‚ÄúHere are the pros and cons of refactoring this service now versus later. How does this align with our broader business goals?‚Äù\n\nTreat your manager like a decision-making API: Feed in the relevant signals, surface what‚Äôs unclear, and work together on an informed response.\n\nUse one-on-ones for career versioning (even before you‚Äôre ‚Äúready‚Äù)\n\nOne-on-one meetings are a great time to discuss your long-term career growth‚Äîeven if you‚Äôre not actively seeking a promotion. Instead of waiting until promotion season, start having these conversations early to build clarity, direction, and momentum over time.\n\nIf you‚Äôre more than a year away from seeking a promotion, start talking to your manager about: Where am I already meeting expectations? Where should I focus on strengthening my skills?\n\nIf you‚Äôre approaching the next level or considering going up for promotion soon, try focusing the conversation on: What kind of work would demonstrate readiness for the next level? Are there specific opportunities I can take on to grow my scope or visibility?\n\n\n\nBy treating growth as an iterative process rather than an all-or-nothing milestone, you can continuously improve and course-correct based on early feedback.\n\nA useful framework for structuring these discussions is the Three Circles of Impact:\n\nIndividual Contributions ‚Äì The direct value of your work. Collaboration ‚Äì How you work with and support others across the team. Enabling Others ‚Äì Mentorship, knowledge sharing, or improving systems and tooling for your peers.\n\nIf you‚Äôre not sure how to show impact across all three, your one-on-one is a great place to explore it. The key is surfacing your goals early so your manager can help guide you toward the kinds of work that will stretch your skills and broaden your influence.\n\nThe more you shape your contributions around these areas, the clearer your readiness for growth becomes‚Äîand the easier it is for your manager to advocate on your behalf.\n\nYour manager can‚Äôt debug what they don‚Äôt see\n\nManagers don‚Äôt have full visibility into your day-to-day experience, so one-on-ones are the right time to highlight persistent blockers and unclear expectations.\n\nFor instance, I once brought up a latency issue I was chasing down. The endpoint‚Äôs performance was slightly above our service level objective (SLO) target, and I had already spent a good chunk of time optimizing it. But in that conversation, my manager offered a different lens:\n\n‚ÄúAre we optimizing for the right thing? We control the SLO. If the extra latency is due to how the system is designed (and if users aren‚Äôt impacted) maybe the right move is to revisit the threshold instead of squeezing more performance out of it.‚Äù\n\nThat single conversation saved me hours and helped me reframe the problem entirely. Sometimes, the fix isn‚Äôt in your code‚Äîit‚Äôs in how you‚Äôre measuring success.\n\nMake your one-on-ones work for you\n\nYour one-on-ones will become far more effective‚Äîand lead to real growth‚Äîwhen you treat them as time to think strategically, not just check in. Reframing these meetings around your goals, your environment, and your long-term development puts you in a much stronger position to advocate for yourself and your work.\n\nStart thinking about your career progression earlier than feels natural. Come prepared. Bring in what‚Äôs going well, what‚Äôs stuck, and where you want to grow. And remember: your manager can‚Äôt fix what they don‚Äôt know about, and they can‚Äôt support your goals if you never share them.\n\nIf this shift feels unfamiliar, you‚Äôre not alone. The Engineer‚Äôs Survival Guide helped me reframe my thinking around one-on-ones.\n\nHere are a few ideas that stuck with me:\n\nYour manager isn‚Äôt a mind reader.\n\nYou can‚Äôt expect guidance if you don‚Äôt come with a direction.\n\nYour growth is a shared effort, but it starts with you.\n\nThe earlier you see one-on-ones as a tool for impact and growth, the more value you‚Äôll get from them.\n\nTags:", "label": "personal"}

I don‚Äôt even have enough time most days to look at the Shellsharks Discord server.\n\nPodcasts\n\nThough not technically ‚Äúreading‚Äù, I also have a couple infosec-related podcasts I tune in to when new episodes become available.\n\nWhen I find interesting articles, I save them to my read-it-later service (which is currently Pocket - though I plan on migrating to something else soon). When I have time, I go back into my saved items and open articles to peruse/digest.\n\nIn addition to browsing and reading articles, I also find time to share interesting articles out (via Mastodon, Threads, Discord or Lemmy) and have discussions about them if/when people engage.\n\nI will admit I am probably on the more extreme end of ‚Äúkeeping up with‚Äù security news/trends and you certainly don‚Äôt need to go to these lengths to stay fresh.

Made a ton of changes to the site. The home page now features a mixed feed of all of my posts, notes, logs and other content types. I‚Äôve also started a link blog to share cool links I come across. Finally, I‚Äôve figured out how to paginate a TON of stuff, to make some of my pages more performant (my Activity page is one good example of how pagination is making that page usable on mobile now).\n\nWith respect to my home page, I used to be kinda precious about only exposing my formal ‚Äúblog posts‚Äù, which are supposed to be longer-form, and in some undefinable way, ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than other things I write and publish on the site. Inspired by others in the Indieweb community, who proudly feature everything they write, I decided to try out the same. To distinguish between different content types, i‚Äôve added a splash of color with icons corresponding to different post types. I also hope it can call attention (for those who are interested) to all the other things I publish. For so long, I had these hidden away in pages you could find via my ‚Äúhamburger‚Äù menu, but you had to go exploring to really find most of it. And given the number of things I link to in that menu, I doubt many people had the patience or interest to really hunt down other things. So, here we are!\n\nLet me know what ya think!

{"title": "5 years", "url": "https://shellsharks.com/notes/2024/05/30/5-years", "content": "Mike Sass\n\n@shellsharks\n\nOn May 30, 2019 I published the very first post to shellsharks.com, ‚ÄúGetting Into Information Security‚Äù. When I first started the blog I didn‚Äôt have a particularly clear idea of what I wanted to do with it, but I had the idea to write that piece and one other idea which which was to catalog all named vulnerabilities. Beyond that, I just wrote about whatever came to mind. It‚Äôs been 5 years to the day since I got that first piece out and not only has the site come a long way, but so have I.\n\nIn the beginning, I think my main focus was to keep the site mostly infosec-related in terms of my writing, but even back then I left the door open to write about other things. Afterall, the tagline for my site has always been ‚ÄúInfosec, Technology, Life‚Äù. The first 4 years of the site did end up skewing mostly Infosec / Tech but since discovering the IndieWeb last year, I have made a noticeable shift towards writing more about ‚ÄúLife‚Äù, i.e. anything non-tech / non-infosec, and it‚Äôs been a lot of fun!\n\nThe site has also gone through a number of big aesthetic overhauls and architectural redesigns. There will always be new things I want to add to the site or ways in which I wish I could rearchitect it even further, but for now, I am quite happy with the latest generation of its look-and-feel as well as the functionality itself.\n\nI‚Äôve not maintained the same level of active-ness throughout the last 5 years, but in more recent history I‚Äôm quite pleased with the amount of attention I‚Äôve given it, the upgrades I‚Äôve made, and the writing I‚Äôve produced, and I am certainly starting the next 5 years quite strong. I plan to continue to funnel my professional work, technological side quests and life experiences into what I write about.\n\nI really want to thank everyone who has read anything I‚Äôve written, those who have offered kind words over social media or elsewhere, those who have given me meaningful/constructive feedback and anyone who has taken the time to subscribe, like or engage with me or my writing. Like many who start a blog, I had no expectation of building a readership. I started it with the intention of sharing my oft-repeated guidance on getting into the infosec field and as a place to write resources for myself. Over time though I have found that sure enough, there are people out there who enjoy, or get value out of what I have documented or what I have to say and it is undoubtedly a good feeling.\n\nThese days, I spend as much if not more effort writing about and encouraging others to start a site and be themselves as I do writing about tech/infosec. My experience with shellsharks has taught me more about what it means to be authentic on the web than it has helped me with my various infosec-related research things. I‚Äôm still a cybersecurity professional and as such will continue to make that a focus of what I learn and thus what I write about, but it is clear to me that I‚Äôve developed a passion for IndieWeb advocacy and I hope to continue to inspire others both in my field and abroad to start their own journey in the personal web.\n\nThanks for reading.

This week, it‚Äôs all about Travel Adventures!\n\nHere are the questions‚Ä¶\n\nSilliest Souvenir\n\nIn 2014 me and my wife went to Costa Rica. We did a lot of travel-by-bus to various excusions and destinations across the country. During those bus rides, I (for whatever reason) witnessed an unusual amount of machete-based chopping of vegetation and general plant-related growth on the sides of the rural roads we traveled down. Now this might not be unusual for Costa Rica, but it was for me as a tourist. So naturally, I wanted to get a machete as a souvenir. At the time of purchasing it, I never considered what it would look like, trying to get a huge machete back through customs at the airport‚Ä¶\n\nState-side, we got to security and that‚Äôs when I remembered my cargo. Sure enough, going through security I was asked to come with them to a back room as they had some questions for me. I thought for sure it was because of the machete. But nope! They were interested in a different souvenir of mine. We had also purchased a ‚Äúrain stick‚Äù, which is effectively just a hollow wooden tube filled with small beads. They were really curious (and slightly concerend) about what all those little beads were inside the stick. After a brief explanation though they were satisfied and I was on my way once more. Not even a single mention of the machete. Hah!\n\nTeleport for a Day Trip\n\nThat‚Äôs me in Bora Bora circa 2016. There‚Äôs a very non-zero chance that I was thinking about climbing that mountain in this exact moment (in addition to just posing for a super-cool sunset pic). If I could teleport to one place for a day to do something, it wound be here, to hike Bora Bora‚Äôs Mount Otemanu. Afterwards, I‚Äôd just chill on the beach with a nice beverage and watch the sun set, much like I did in 2016. üèùÔ∏è üåÖ\n\nWeirdest Food\n\nIn 2013, I went on my first international trip ever. So where does one go on their first trip out of the country? Africa of course! Me and my wife went to South Africa‚Äîfirst to Cape Town and then to Kruger National Park for some safari-ing. To this day (and I‚Äôve done a fair bit of travel since), I would still say it‚Äôs my favorite trip I‚Äôve ever done. One night, while dining out in the city-center of Cape Town, we ordered what I remember as some sort of ‚Äúexotic meat sampler‚Äù. On the resulting plate, we tried a number of interesting South African-native game including Kudu, Crocodile, Springbok and if I‚Äôm remembering fully, Zebra. All I really remember about that experience beyond what I tried was that Kudu was delicious, and I was not into the croc.\n\nMemorable Wrong Turn\n\nLook, my wife is the (trip) planner of the two of us, and she is amazing at it. What this means is that our trips are always fantastic, we get into a TON of fun activities, and we rarely encounter anything you might consider a ‚Äúwrong turn‚Äù. That said, this particlar question made me think of two distinct wrong-turn-esque events‚Ä¶\n\nOnce, while driving somewhere in Germany we witnessed this little car in front of us try to make too sharp of a turn on a highway on-ramp and completely spin out‚Äîlike a 360¬∞ spin. It was wild, and quite scary to witness. A ‚Äúwrong turn‚Äù for that individual to say the least.\n\nThe most memorable ‚Äúwrong turn‚Äù for me however occurred when me and my wife were trying to drive back from the national park in Sintra, Portugal to where we were staying in Lisbon. We exited the park into what I imagine was the old-town part of Sintra and ended up on some very tiny streets with extremely narrow passage ways between the buildings and walls of the town. At one point, my wife had to get out of the car and help me narrowly traverse one particularly tight corridor. Our rental was a pretty small car too. Luckily, we made it out without a scratch, literally!\n\nThanks for reading!", "label": "personal"}
{"title": "Things I Wish I Knew Before I Made My Website", "url": "https://shellsharks.com/blog-things-i-wish-i-had-known", "content": "Here‚Äôs a list of things I wish I had known before I set out on my blogging / site-making / IndieWeb journey. (In no particular order)\n\n\n\nHad I known these, and carefully considered each, I would have saved myself A LOT of time fixing stuff, and even now, would have a lot less things to fix and add. For example, my CSS files are a mess, I have a lot of poorly managed inline .JS everywhere, accessiblity nightmares abound and much more‚Ä¶ Learn from my mistakes!\n\nUnderstand and properly leverage Semantic HTML Elements. This approach will help your code be more readable, more modular and more descriptive.\n\nBe purposeful and methodical with your CSS ‚Äúcode‚Äù. Try to define common sense CSS and make it reusable. To the best of your ability, try to avoid overusing inline CSS. It will make things harder to troubleshoot and more annoying to maintain over time. Take the time to understand dynamic HTMl stuff for different screen-sized devices, etc‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre going to want your site to look good on desktops and phones, simple as that.\n\nUse JavaScript sparingly, try to design your site to work well-enough for those who completely disable JavaScript. Look, my site has plenty of JS, and I know certain things would completely break if it were disabled (looking at you hamburger menu). That‚Äôs really too bad for folks who want to use my site. I‚Äôd like to fix this, but just haven‚Äôt had time to figure it out. Also consider The JavaScript Trap. JS not only has incompatibility issues, but can also just slow down your site and introduce potential security vulns. Important things to consider!\n\nDon‚Äôt box yourself in creatively‚Äî REALLY! Allow yourself to write about whatever you want. Use things like collections, different post types or tags to logically differentiate things you think are meant for different audiences if you must.\n\nVersion one of your site should have a theme toggle (i.e. dark/light mode) and a search function. You‚Äôre going to want these eventually, and it‚Äôs worth getting them right in the initial design if you ask me.\n\nBuild accessibility in from the get-go. I‚Äôve put very little effort into this, and that sucks. One of my Guiding Principles for this site is that it is available to be consumed by all. Yet, if I‚Äôve not made it adequately accessible, it will never meet this mantra. It‚Äôs not necessarily hard to do, but if you don‚Äôt consider it from t=0, it becomes harder and more time-consuming to retroactively make it so.\n\nWrite for yourself, not for some perceived ‚Äúaudience‚Äù. Don‚Äôt try to be a persona (i.e. some ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù fragment of your true self)‚Äîjust be yourself.\n\nDo some basic website wireframing as part of your initial size build. Carefully consider what you want your home page to look like, how you want people to navigate about, what you want your posts to look like, etc‚Ä¶\n\nHow ‚Äúsocial‚Äù do you want your site to be? In the age of the social web, there is a lot you can add or implement to make your site interoperate with ActivityPub, IndieWeb protocols, comment systems, etc‚Ä¶", "label": "personal"}
{"title": "How I take my coffee", "url": "https://shellsharks.com/notes/2025/05/13/how-i-take-my-coffee", "content": "Mike Sass\n\n@shellsharks\n\nRiffing on Axxuy and Elena‚Äôs posts about how they drink coffee, here‚Äôs how I take my coffee‚Ä¶ ‚òïÔ∏è\n\nAs of March (2025) I‚Äôve gotten into making at-home cold-brew coffee. It‚Äôs delicious! I normally take 2/3 of a pint glass with a splash of half-n-half, another splash of 2% milk, then top it off with ice (cubes). This is what I drink most of the time these days. Since I‚Äôm newish to brewing my own cold brew, I‚Äôm still exploring what types of beans I like most and have really been enjoying sampling different roasts and regions (speaking of, maybe I should start a sort of ‚Äúcoffeelog‚Äù where I can do some tasting notes / reviews‚Ä¶ ü§î). Not sure what I like the most yet, but I do know that it‚Äôs far better than the french press swill I had been making before.\n\nWhen I‚Äôm out ‚Äòn about and ordering coffee, I typically go with an iced latte or sometimes just an iced coffee. I like getting the latte‚Äôs because I can‚Äôt make them at home. I never drink hot coffee. I‚Äôd rather have no coffee than have it hot. I just don‚Äôt enjoy hot beverages. When I do happen across a Starbucks, my go-to order is their Iced Brown Sugar Oatmilk Shaken Espresso, with just 1 pump of the syrup, otherwise it‚Äôs too sweet for my liking.\n\nCheers!", "label": "personal"}
